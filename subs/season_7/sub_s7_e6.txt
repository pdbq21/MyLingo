WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.689
The reason I asked you to brunch...

00:03.905 --> 00:07.060
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

00:07.350 --> 00:09.295
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

00:10.237 --> 00:11.340
I hope it's you.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.468
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

00:15.247 --> 00:17.430
First of all,
I love you both so much.

00:17.718 --> 00:21.359
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

00:22.728 --> 00:25.301
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

00:25.545 --> 00:27.692
...where we trade off
being maid of honor.

00:27.947 --> 00:31.173
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

00:33.026 --> 00:34.271
Hypothetically.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.624
Still.

00:37.096 --> 00:41.059
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

00:41.271 --> 00:43.845
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

00:44.264 --> 00:48.333
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So, who's yours?

00:49.587 --> 00:53.193
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

00:55.571 --> 00:58.418
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.855
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

01:05.139 --> 01:06.598
I'd like to make a toast.

01:07.469 --> 01:09.936
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

01:10.809 --> 01:14.878
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

01:15.333 --> 01:16.957
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.481
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

01:21.769 --> 01:24.130
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.708
Good luck!

01:28.414 --> 01:30.846
Oh, and good luck to you too!

01:31.406 --> 01:33.280
What a nice lady.

01:34.955 --> 01:39.083
The One With Nap Partners

02:13.957 --> 02:16.353
Yeah!

02:16.705 --> 02:20.003
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.021
Let's make it a double feature?

02:22.271 --> 02:23.481
What else you rent?

02:24.116 --> 02:26.060
Die Hard 2.

02:27.073 --> 02:28.982
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

02:30.413 --> 02:34.446
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

02:35.631 --> 02:38.264
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

02:38.520 --> 02:40.501
It would be cool to see it again!

02:40.816 --> 02:43.556
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!

02:45.269 --> 02:47.250
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

02:48.226 --> 02:49.756
Is everything okay?

02:50.418 --> 02:52.671
Yeah, I just got plans.

02:53.097 --> 02:56.252
Well, John McClane had plans.

02:57.203 --> 03:00.228
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

03:00.473 --> 03:02.762
...and starts calling
everybody "bitch."

03:04.265 --> 03:06.898
What are you talking about, bitch?

03:10.006 --> 03:11.465
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

03:11.746 --> 03:15.256
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

03:15.503 --> 03:16.890
Really?

03:17.417 --> 03:20.406
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean, I'm just...

03:20.687 --> 03:22.075
Wait a minute.

03:25.106 --> 03:29.068
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

03:29.315 --> 03:30.631
Oh.

03:32.238 --> 03:34.183
Well, if that's what you want.

03:35.474 --> 03:38.047
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

03:38.326 --> 03:41.588
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

03:41.840 --> 03:44.023
Because this one is now.

03:44.693 --> 03:47.054
And it's two of our best friends.

03:47.337 --> 03:49.769
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

03:51.721 --> 03:54.983
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

03:56.418 --> 03:57.842
You wouldn't.

03:59.828 --> 04:03.826
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

04:04.107 --> 04:07.369
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

04:07.656 --> 04:09.708
I know you've done it at least twice.

04:09.987 --> 04:12.798
- Yeah, but Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

04:14.579 --> 04:16.133
I guess that was it.

04:18.093 --> 04:19.267
Okay.

04:19.798 --> 04:23.688
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

04:23.939 --> 04:25.920
Oh, thank you so much!

04:27.661 --> 04:28.835
Yay.

04:31.592 --> 04:33.644
I'm gonna marry someone good.

04:34.585 --> 04:35.593
Oh, I know.

04:35.907 --> 04:37.401
Better than Chandler.

04:58.104 --> 05:00.156
- What happened?
- I don't know.

05:05.863 --> 05:08.603
We fell asleep. That is all.

05:08.889 --> 05:11.320
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

05:13.134 --> 05:15.007
All right, well, I'd better go.

05:15.257 --> 05:17.201
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.073
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.731
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

05:26.320 --> 05:28.502
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

05:32.234 --> 05:35.116
Die Hard!

05:39.506 --> 05:42.175
Opening a topless carwash
was a great idea.

05:42.394 --> 05:45.205
We'll definitely have enough money
to open our bikini shop.

05:50.326 --> 05:53.137
Now we mince the shallots like this.

05:53.387 --> 05:57.136
Look, honey, the nice people
are chopping shallots.

05:58.119 --> 06:01.524
Maybe if they chop enough of them,
they can open that bikini shot.

06:03.338 --> 06:05.247
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.998
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you...

06:08.278 --> 06:10.081
...and she wished me good luck.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.512
That's sweet.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.674
No, it was more like a "good luck."

06:15.933 --> 06:20.903
Well, do you think she meant,
"Good luck taming that wild stallion."

06:21.673 --> 06:25.457
Not judging you, a little gay.

06:25.744 --> 06:27.820
So, what did this woman look like?

06:28.179 --> 06:30.433
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

06:30.650 --> 06:35.062
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

06:35.798 --> 06:37.875
Was it someone you dated in college?

06:38.130 --> 06:40.348
No, I only dated two girls
in college...

06:40.635 --> 06:43.968
...both blond, both not attractive.

06:45.088 --> 06:46.547
Let me check this out.

06:46.758 --> 06:49.391
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

06:49.681 --> 06:52.457
Okay, is that her?

06:52.708 --> 06:54.024
Oh, my God, yes!

06:54.308 --> 06:57.949
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

06:59.039 --> 07:00.807
Did you break up with her?

07:01.579 --> 07:03.596
No, we're still together.

07:07.842 --> 07:11.140
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.502
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

07:13.722 --> 07:17.305
...and she'd gotten really fa...

07:20.193 --> 07:22.790
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

07:23.116 --> 07:25.689
I said fa...

07:26.838 --> 07:29.756
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

07:29.969 --> 07:31.737
Yeah. Yeah.

07:32.092 --> 07:36.327
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

07:36.546 --> 07:37.862
Apparently she does.

07:38.111 --> 07:40.993
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget."

07:45.278 --> 07:47.674
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.670
Rach, wanna come with me Friday night?
I'm gonna check out some male strippers.

07:55.855 --> 07:57.728
For the bachelorette party?

07:58.569 --> 07:59.992
Yes.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.292
Hey, what's going on?

08:03.578 --> 08:05.522
She's Monica's maid of honor.

08:05.771 --> 08:10.112
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.989
You have been maid of honor before?

08:15.233 --> 08:18.982
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

08:19.895 --> 08:21.876
That's it. I am maid of honor.

08:22.157 --> 08:24.173
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

08:24.453 --> 08:27.086
Because I cared enough to lie.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.077
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

08:30.368 --> 08:31.791
We could have an audition.

08:32.073 --> 08:35.098
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

08:35.343 --> 08:37.525
- What do you mean?
- When I want a job...

08:37.813 --> 08:40.968
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

08:41.258 --> 08:42.017
...I get the part.

08:42.475 --> 08:45.013
Then they send you a script.
You go to the set.

08:45.259 --> 08:47.204
You rehearse and you
have wardrobe fittings.

08:47.451 --> 08:49.360
Then you shoot your part.
And it's great.

08:49.573 --> 08:52.527
But right after that, you're back out
on the street looking for work again.

08:52.739 --> 08:55.171
Right back where you started.

08:55.383 --> 09:00.175
So I gotta say, I don't think a career in
acting is the right choice for you two.

09:05.820 --> 09:09.082
Joey, the maid of honor thing.

09:09.995 --> 09:11.976
Right.

09:13.196 --> 09:16.078
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

09:16.363 --> 09:18.545
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

09:18.972 --> 09:21.641
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

09:21.964 --> 09:25.511
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

09:26.487 --> 09:30.306
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

09:31.253 --> 09:32.462
Hi!

09:32.749 --> 09:34.896
Ross, sweetie.

09:37.168 --> 09:40.015
Hey there, handsome thing.

09:43.605 --> 09:48.018
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

09:54.425 --> 09:55.528
Hey.

09:55.851 --> 09:58.841
Just brought back your videos.

09:59.087 --> 10:02.977
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.171
No. No, we don't.

10:05.662 --> 10:06.563
Yes, we do.

10:07.089 --> 10:10.279
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

10:15.126 --> 10:17.795
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.026
Come on, admit it.

10:20.275 --> 10:22.327
That was the best nap you ever had.

10:23.546 --> 10:25.099
I've had better.

10:26.954 --> 10:28.722
Okay. When?

10:30.469 --> 10:33.387
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

10:33.774 --> 10:35.090
I said it, okay?

10:35.340 --> 10:37.285
But it's over, Joey!

10:39.411 --> 10:40.869
I want to do it again.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.886
We can't do it again.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.531
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

10:51.100 --> 10:52.416
Fine.

10:53.849 --> 10:54.821
You want a drink?

10:55.101 --> 10:58.577
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

11:05.852 --> 11:07.310
Chandler.

11:08.287 --> 11:10.470
I just figured out who you are.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.940
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

11:14.411 --> 11:16.985
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

11:17.925 --> 11:20.392
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.972
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.395
Do you know why?

11:25.683 --> 11:29.917
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

11:30.450 --> 11:33.641
No, but because he thought
I was too fa...

11:35.842 --> 11:39.140
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

11:39.391 --> 11:41.965
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

11:42.244 --> 11:45.305
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

11:45.550 --> 11:49.263
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

11:49.550 --> 11:53.026
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

11:53.273 --> 11:55.942
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

11:58.422 --> 11:59.845
- I can live with that.
- Okay.

12:00.092 --> 12:03.497
- So how do we find her.
- She probably lives in the city.

12:03.746 --> 12:06.522
- She was eating in that restaurant.
- I'll bet she was.

12:10.843 --> 12:12.467
What is wrong with me?

12:14.566 --> 12:18.456
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

12:18.706 --> 12:21.102
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.712
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.186
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

12:30.570 --> 12:32.372
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

12:32.657 --> 12:35.290
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

12:35.614 --> 12:39.742
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

12:40.033 --> 12:42.216
I don't want to marry Chandler.

12:42.503 --> 12:44.650
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

12:44.904 --> 12:47.335
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.050
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

12:52.558 --> 12:54.575
Look, Monica...

12:54.890 --> 12:56.906
...getting cold feet is very common.

12:57.186 --> 12:59.511
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

12:59.830 --> 13:03.828
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.612
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

13:06.927 --> 13:09.323
You don't get to keep the gifts.

13:10.336 --> 13:12.412
Drawing on your own experience.

13:12.702 --> 13:13.876
Very good.

13:14.164 --> 13:16.453
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

13:16.703 --> 13:17.877
Thank you, judges.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.182
- Kiss ass.
- Oh.

13:21.957 --> 13:24.389
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

13:25.436 --> 13:27.168
We're now in the ceremony.

13:27.385 --> 13:29.366
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

13:29.716 --> 13:32.005
...when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.536
What do you do? Go!

13:33.856 --> 13:36.394
When Monica was a little girl...

13:36.640 --> 13:38.478
...I remember that...

13:41.406 --> 13:42.829
Ow!

13:43.111 --> 13:44.499
- Very good!
- Oh.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.105
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

13:47.424 --> 13:50.758
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

13:51.043 --> 13:53.747
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?

13:54.626 --> 13:56.608
Ladies, please. Please.

13:56.818 --> 13:59.973
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.175
The wedding is about to start.

14:02.385 --> 14:06.976
You walk into the back room and you
find Monica taking a nap with Ross.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.751
I'll be Monica. Go!

14:08.961 --> 14:10.514
No, no, no!

14:13.588 --> 14:15.605
This situation is not sanctioned!

14:17.972 --> 14:20.439
Now, we're moving on to the next one.

14:20.686 --> 14:22.275
Okay.

14:24.164 --> 14:28.755
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.495
We haven't even prepared...

14:30.741 --> 14:33.029
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay.

14:34.359 --> 14:36.684
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

14:37.003 --> 14:41.416
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

14:41.665 --> 14:46.565
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

14:46.848 --> 14:51.712
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

14:51.998 --> 14:54.287
...although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.520
Oh.

14:57.321 --> 14:59.504
Thank you. Thank you very much.

15:01.496 --> 15:04.166
I've known them
separately and together.

15:04.488 --> 15:09.529
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

15:09.916 --> 15:13.036
So I would like to raise my glass...

15:13.360 --> 15:14.949
...to Monica and Chandler...

15:15.204 --> 15:19.652
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.516
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

15:24.563 --> 15:25.986
Wow.

15:27.346 --> 15:29.529
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

15:29.782 --> 15:30.813
Oh, thanks.

15:31.104 --> 15:36.004
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

15:39.558 --> 15:40.626
Okay.

15:42.864 --> 15:46.268
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

15:46.552 --> 15:49.054
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

15:49.300 --> 15:52.076
...while we were
showering together, naked.

15:59.738 --> 16:01.683
And she's back in the game!

16:11.566 --> 16:12.538
Julie. Hi.

16:12.784 --> 16:15.038
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

16:15.394 --> 16:17.339
Hello, Skidmark.

16:20.299 --> 16:22.552
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

16:23.118 --> 16:24.612
It's pretty clear.

16:27.362 --> 16:30.909
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

16:31.189 --> 16:34.594
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

16:35.504 --> 16:37.342
That's why you broke up with me?

16:40.896 --> 16:42.805
You didn't know that?

16:44.792 --> 16:47.081
Well, I guess my work here is done.

16:51.716 --> 16:54.218
Can I get you guys something to drink
while you tabulate?

16:54.500 --> 16:57.097
Actually, the final
vote has been tallied.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.378
- I'll take a cocoa.
- Too late.

17:01.075 --> 17:05.832
But first of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

17:06.120 --> 17:07.579
You should be proud.

17:07.895 --> 17:12.616
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

17:12.905 --> 17:15.158
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

17:16.801 --> 17:18.355
Really? I won.

17:18.645 --> 17:21.527
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

17:21.776 --> 17:25.525
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.803
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.266
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

17:31.866 --> 17:33.040
Heads.

17:35.136 --> 17:37.639
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

17:39.033 --> 17:42.437
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

17:42.755 --> 17:47.761
...vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

17:48.427 --> 17:52.804
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

17:55.142 --> 17:58.819
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

17:59.073 --> 18:00.176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:00.465 --> 18:04.664
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

18:07.945 --> 18:10.341
Why would I care about that?

18:11.702 --> 18:14.691
No reason. I'm just saying that...

18:15.738 --> 18:17.197
...that's where I'll be.

18:38.178 --> 18:40.848
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

18:41.137 --> 18:45.443
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

18:45.694 --> 18:48.161
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

18:48.512 --> 18:52.509
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

18:55.471 --> 18:58.460
All right, I have to ask.

18:58.985 --> 18:59.993
What?

19:01.315 --> 19:03.568
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

19:03.785 --> 19:04.924
What?

19:05.177 --> 19:08.475
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

19:08.726 --> 19:10.979
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.693
In one year?

19:14.049 --> 19:16.160
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

19:18.746 --> 19:20.335
That's not the point.

19:20.590 --> 19:24.480
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 15.

19:24.730 --> 19:28.929
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

19:30.471 --> 19:33.425
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

19:33.671 --> 19:34.703
You called me fat.

19:35.029 --> 19:36.132
Wait a minute.

19:36.386 --> 19:38.924
- That was totally different.
- How?

19:39.169 --> 19:42.988
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

19:44.527 --> 19:47.753
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

19:48.075 --> 19:50.507
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.680
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

19:58.861 --> 20:02.230
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

20:04.044 --> 20:06.333
What I mean is, you're Monica.

20:06.585 --> 20:09.609
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

20:10.447 --> 20:11.478
Keep going.

20:11.733 --> 20:15.696
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

20:16.014 --> 20:17.923
...and I will still love you.

20:19.596 --> 20:22.752
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

20:23.841 --> 20:25.786
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.398
I love you.

20:30.661 --> 20:34.658
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.615
Hi, Pheebs.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.223
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.130
I just want to apologize.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.746
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.471
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

20:51.153 --> 20:53.229
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

20:54.284 --> 20:57.724
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

20:58.146 --> 20:59.843
And I was thinking about it.

21:00.129 --> 21:03.224
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

21:03.469 --> 21:05.522
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:07.575 --> 21:11.157
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

21:11.401 --> 21:14.283
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

21:14.533 --> 21:17.759
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

21:18.047 --> 21:20.158
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

21:20.412 --> 21:24.196
Here's a picture from one Halloween
where she dressed up as a bride.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.002
She made me carry her train...

21:26.292 --> 21:29.388
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

21:31.268 --> 21:33.841
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

21:34.121 --> 21:36.897
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

21:37.148 --> 21:39.781
- Oh.
- Something. And...

21:40.035 --> 21:44.519
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

21:44.801 --> 21:47.162
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.637
This stuff is great.

21:50.925 --> 21:53.178
I forgot this was in here.

21:55.761 --> 21:59.272
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.228
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

22:04.007 --> 22:05.287
And it's blue.

22:11.278 --> 22:14.718
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

22:16.845 --> 22:18.304
You do?

22:19.315 --> 22:22.435
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

22:23.351 --> 22:25.605
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

22:25.890 --> 22:27.942
It's fine.
I mean, this is something...

22:28.152 --> 22:31.758
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

22:32.153 --> 22:35.107
No, I was 10.
I just developed early.

22:36.049 --> 22:37.959
Man alive!

22:40.921 --> 22:42.688
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

22:42.939 --> 22:45.999
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

22:46.591 --> 22:48.738
Oh, that's great!

22:49.061 --> 22:52.359
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

22:52.611 --> 22:54.627
I have really specific ideas.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.888
We should meet four times a week.

22:57.134 --> 22:59.981
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

23:00.717 --> 23:03.872
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

23:12.024 --> 23:14.206
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

23:14.495 --> 23:15.918
She's gonna be yours.

23:32.099 --> 23:33.415
Great nap.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.539
It really was.

23:53.844 --> 23:55.647
What the hell are you doing?

23:56.628 --> 23:58.051
God!

24:04.351 --> 24:05.940
Excuse me.
