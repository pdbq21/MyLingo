WEBVTT

00:04.537 --> 00:05.731
Okay, this is it.

00:06.606 --> 00:08.073
You sure you wanna do this?

00:12.278 --> 00:14.542
Hello, Mrs. Ross.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.977
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.958
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

00:28.995 --> 00:30.724
Come on, Phoebe, hurry!

00:30.930 --> 00:32.830
Okay! Okay!

00:34.901 --> 00:37.665
Oh, my God!
Is everybody getting married?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.441
No running in the chapel.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.576
Hey, don't you give me
any of your.. Hey!

00:47.447 --> 00:48.607
Why are you here?

00:48.815 --> 00:52.012
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

00:52.285 --> 00:56.517
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
-Yes. Why else would we be here?

00:59.592 --> 01:01.355
What happened?
Did we miss it?

01:01.628 --> 01:02.959
We missed it.

01:03.163 --> 01:06.326
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

01:07.400 --> 01:09.265
I can't believe they got married.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.529
I know! I didn't even know
they were dating.

01:11.704 --> 01:14.172
I don't think they're as much dating
as they are...

01:14.340 --> 01:17.707
...two bottles of vodka walking
around in human form.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.139
This is insane.

01:19.345 --> 01:22.314
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.315
What?

01:25.351 --> 01:28.320
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.353
If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.753
Really?

01:35.361 --> 01:36.419
Yeah.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.160
Oh, my God!

01:40.266 --> 01:41.324
Oh, well.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.032
The One After Vegas

02:56.142 --> 02:57.575
Why are we in bed together?

02:57.810 --> 02:59.072
I don't know.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.107
-Did we?
-I don't know.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.851
Do you have any clothes on?

03:07.921 --> 03:08.910
Yes.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.180
-Really?
-No.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.518
But we didn't have..

03:17.564 --> 03:19.759
...sex, did we?

03:21.701 --> 03:24.192
I don't remember much
about last night.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.737
It was such a blur.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.276
I remember laughing.
I laughed a lot.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.945
Then we didn't have sex.

03:38.051 --> 03:42.112
Well, so, what did we do last night?

03:43.089 --> 03:46.650
I don't know, but I think
it was a lot of fun.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.090
Luckily, not too much fun, right?

03:49.262 --> 03:50.991
-I don't think so.
-Oh, thank God.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.725
Oh, I mean,
we were really drunk.

03:57.937 --> 03:59.700
I'm glad we didn't
do anything stupid.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.464
Tell me about it.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.379
Morning, Phoebe.

04:09.215 --> 04:12.446
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.251
Joey, I'm so sorry.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.717
You want my breakfast?

04:17.624 --> 04:19.421
Too depressed to eat.

04:19.626 --> 04:21.992
I'll probably eat in, like,
five minutes.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.931
I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

04:26.165 --> 04:28.725
-What about my cab?
-I don't need that anymore.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.464
You borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.800
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.509
How about if you come with me?

04:38.745 --> 04:41.111
-It's a long trip.
-That would be great.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.646
We could talk and play games.

04:43.916 --> 04:47.784
This could be our chance
to, like, renew our friendship.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.316
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

04:53.426 --> 04:54.518
Sure?

04:55.028 --> 04:59.692
All right. Although, I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.767
So has anybody talked
to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?

05:07.006 --> 05:09.338
They left me a message.
They'll be here.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.204
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.378
It's a buffet, man.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.048
Here's where I win
all my money back!

05:22.689 --> 05:23.951
I gotta talk to you.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.181
Sure.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.551
What's up?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.326
Monica and I almost got married.

05:37.637 --> 05:38.968
My God!

05:39.172 --> 05:41.163
That's huge!

05:42.909 --> 05:45.400
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

05:46.412 --> 05:50.644
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

05:51.184 --> 05:55.177
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her...

05:55.421 --> 05:58.913
...but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel...

05:59.158 --> 06:04.095
...was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

06:04.831 --> 06:07.026
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

06:09.736 --> 06:12.034
Tell her she's not marriage material.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.364
What?

06:16.776 --> 06:19.040
Girls say it to me all the time.

06:21.180 --> 06:25.014
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.112
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

06:29.355 --> 06:31.755
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.290
-Well, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.427
Good. I was just testing you.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.761
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.093
We were just talking about bacon.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.563
No, we were talking about tennis.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.069
Tennis is more believable.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.936
Thank you.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.076
Coffee.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.213
What?

07:06.392 --> 07:09.418
Are we gonna talk about
what you guys did last night?

07:11.564 --> 07:15.056
What do you mean "last night"?
Nothing happened last night.

07:15.735 --> 07:18.397
Ross invited us all to watch.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.278
What is the matter with you?

07:26.813 --> 07:29.475
We weren't gonna miss
our friends getting married.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.547
Who got married?

07:33.719 --> 07:35.152
You did.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.515
What?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.954
-Hello. We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't. That's ridi..

07:46.833 --> 07:49.700
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

07:49.902 --> 07:53.360
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.632
They let you get married.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.037
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.412
Now, I'm drunk right now.

08:03.149 --> 08:07.017
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

08:07.553 --> 08:08.850
What are you gonna do?

08:09.055 --> 08:11.489
Well, I guess we find
a divorce lawyer.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.819
Well, I think.. I think
Ross already has one.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.829
Yeah, that guy's finally gonna
be able to put in that pool.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.224
Okay.

08:23.402 --> 08:27.429
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.369
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

08:30.576 --> 08:33.067
...because we don't need
to get divorced.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.110
-We're just gonna get an annulment.
-An annulment?

08:36.349 --> 08:39.546
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.955
Oh, that's your thing!

08:44.957 --> 08:46.049
What?

08:47.093 --> 08:50.187
Your thing. You're the guy
who gets divorced.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.430
No, no, that's not "my thing."

08:55.201 --> 08:57.260
I do not love getting divorced.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.796
Yes, you do. This is
your third divorce.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.703
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it...

09:06.779 --> 09:10.408
...and then it won't work out,
so you're gonna have to divorce it.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.480
I'm so drunk.

09:20.993 --> 09:24.224
-You wanna play some Pai Gow?
-Maybe.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.456
But I kind of think we should talk
about last night.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.625
That's a good idea.
I wanna talk about last night too...

09:30.803 --> 09:34.933
-and I don't know what Pai Gow is.
-I see.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.066
-So what should we do?
-I don't know.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.972
I know I love you.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.770
I know I love you.

09:46.819 --> 09:49.253
Where are we on the whole
"going back...

09:49.455 --> 09:52.447
to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.920
That's a good question.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.888
Last night we let the dice decide.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.123
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.967
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.797
So say...

10:06.005 --> 10:08.496
you roll another eight,
then there's a sign...

10:08.741 --> 10:09.969
that we should marry.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.768
Eight we get married...

10:11.978 --> 10:16.312
but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12, we don't get married.

10:16.582 --> 10:17.640
Sounds great.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.744
Hey, we got a shooter.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.112
Money, please.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.514
-Ready?
-Ready.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.518
Come on, eight.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.623
Yes, yes, eight.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.491
Eight, easy eight.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.160
-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
-That was so unlikely.

10:41.841 --> 10:42.933
Let's get married.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.802
I guess.

10:45.611 --> 10:48.045
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.113
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

10:52.652 --> 10:54.017
I wanted it so bad!

10:57.490 --> 10:58.514
Wanna go pack?

11:01.794 --> 11:03.284
We're doing the right thing.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.986
Of course we are.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.028
We left it up to fate.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.862
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.713
Okay, you have 19 questions left.
Use them wisely.

11:26.585 --> 11:30.851
Come on, Joey. You can't win
if you don't ask any questions!

11:32.725 --> 11:35.523
-What?
-You promised me a fun road trip.

11:35.728 --> 11:39.494
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.930
We are switching, and
you are going to drive back.

11:43.169 --> 11:47.003
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper!

11:47.940 --> 11:49.032
All right.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.108
And until then, you are going
to sing to me...

11:52.344 --> 11:56.747
...because the radio's broken and you are
selfish, but you have a nice voice.

11:57.783 --> 11:58.875
-Really?
-Sing!

11:59.085 --> 12:04.216
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

12:11.797 --> 12:14.027
Man, this is a long drive.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.133
Are my eyes open?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.631
No!

12:34.653 --> 12:36.177
Morning.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.958
-Hey.
-Hey, hubby.

12:48.834 --> 12:53.100
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that whole annulment thing.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.330
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.818
Okay.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.384
So we'll just stay married.

13:10.589 --> 13:11.851
Yes, exactly.

13:12.057 --> 13:15.891
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.056
Wow, this is so amazing.

13:19.265 --> 13:23.201
I really thought I'd have to
talk you into this more.

13:24.203 --> 13:28.071
Now I'm scared because I don't
actually think you're kidding.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.338
I'm not kidding.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.011
Look...

13:33.212 --> 13:36.443
...I can't have three
failed marriages.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.206
I can't, okay?

13:38.450 --> 13:41.613
I am not gonna be that guy.

13:41.921 --> 13:45.823
Okay? No, no. That is not gonna be
"my thing."

13:47.827 --> 13:50.421
So, what, we just
stay married forever?

13:50.596 --> 13:52.359
I don't know.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.927
I mean, I haven't worked it all
out yet, but....

13:56.101 --> 14:00.265
Okay, I know it's a bit crazy..

14:00.439 --> 14:03.431
How is this going
to affect you, really?

14:06.178 --> 14:09.375
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while...

14:09.582 --> 14:13.746
instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs."

14:13.953 --> 14:16.888
It's right next to it.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.688
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.623
We can stay married...

14:23.896 --> 14:28.424
because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.001
-No, they're right..
-Ross!

14:32.838 --> 14:35.432
All right.
Just...

14:35.641 --> 14:37.609
please take a moment here...

14:37.810 --> 14:40.711
and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

14:41.513 --> 14:46.007
I am asking you to do me a favor.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.987
You are asking me to be your wife.

14:52.191 --> 14:57.128
And as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.761
We did make vows.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.939
That kid kicked me really hard.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.141
Well, you did pull his hair.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.677
-He took my snack.
-I'm not getting into this again.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.473
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.741
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.418
There. There. Okay.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.487
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.493
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

15:38.704 --> 15:43.334
He could be a rap.. He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.271
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

15:46.979 --> 15:49.777
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.450
-And, you, are you a rapist?
-No.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.346
Do you like car games?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.814
Yeah, you know
the license plate game?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.717
I love the license plate game!

15:59.458 --> 16:00.857
I'll play. I'll play.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.119
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.638
Listen. I know you wanted
to talk to me...

16:13.839 --> 16:17.400
but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.972
We register...

16:21.180 --> 16:23.910
and you get to keep
all the presents.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.678
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.187
I've thought about
how to tell you this.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.153
I came up with an analogy
about a little goldfish...

16:36.328 --> 16:38.125
in a pond that freezes over
in the winter...

16:38.297 --> 16:41.630
but I realized that was a story about
what to do when people pick on you.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.133
So I'm gonna actually save that
for my children's book.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.797
-What's up?
-Oh, sorry.

16:47.973 --> 16:49.463
The bottom line, Ross...

16:49.675 --> 16:52.405
is we cannot stay married.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.747
-I don't know if that's true..
-Oh, but it is.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.817
Okay. You know what this is?

17:00.019 --> 17:03.511
This is a difference of opinion.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.725
-When that happens in a marriage..
-Ross, come on!

17:08.927 --> 17:12.556
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

17:13.899 --> 17:17.027
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.874
All right.
All right, I'll do it.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.440
Thank you.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.072
Hey, hey...

17:28.113 --> 17:31.412
is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

17:35.621 --> 17:38.089
There's the train station.
This is where I get off.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.588
I have your address
and phone number.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.853
I have your name and the fact
that you're a drifter.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.896
So ball's pretty much
in your court.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.561
All right. See you, Phoebe.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.735
Come on, Phoebe, I can't
take this anymore.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.277
Please talk to me.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.614
Let me make it up to you.

18:08.220 --> 18:12.088
Ground control to Major Tom

18:13.592 --> 18:17.323
Commencing countdown
Engines on

18:19.665 --> 18:21.826
Take your protein pills

18:22.134 --> 18:25.968
And put your helmet on

18:26.939 --> 18:29.840
-This is..
-Stop it! Stop it! No!

18:31.410 --> 18:35.244
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.572
Phoebe, look, I am so sorry.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.513
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend...

18:41.787 --> 18:44.449
and I didn't deliver, okay?

18:44.656 --> 18:49.616
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.664
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.860
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.368
Thank you.

19:03.108 --> 19:05.440
So can we play 20 Questions now?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.477
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.307
Okay.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.776
Is it...

19:13.986 --> 19:16.386
a kind of hot sandwich?

19:17.022 --> 19:18.455
Yes.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.050
Is it a meatball sub?

19:21.326 --> 19:23.226
That is incredible!

19:23.795 --> 19:25.660
You are the master!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.732
Bug!

19:38.644 --> 19:42.171
-Enough already!
-Well, you didn't have to catch them!

19:43.215 --> 19:45.479
-You look like you're..
-Don't say it!

19:45.717 --> 19:47.378
Don't even think it.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.880
All right.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.714
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

19:56.161 --> 19:57.788
Should we just get married?

19:57.996 --> 20:00.726
All the signs are telling us to do it.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.264
I'm sick of the signs.

20:02.467 --> 20:05.163
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.133
-I don't want change, do you?
-No.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.502
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!

20:10.776 --> 20:13.745
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it drives me insane!

20:15.981 --> 20:18.449
Jeez, relax, it's not
like we're mar..

20:28.660 --> 20:30.855
You know, I was thinking,
what if I...

20:31.463 --> 20:32.930
unpack here?

20:33.298 --> 20:34.822
All your stuff would be here.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.263
Well...

20:41.039 --> 20:42.870
...what if all my stuff was here?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.440
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.706
Doesn't make any sense.

20:49.114 --> 20:50.547
Okay.

20:53.118 --> 20:56.281
What if we live together,
and you get what I'm saying?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.183
Live together?

21:02.194 --> 21:03.684
There've been no signs for that.

21:04.396 --> 21:07.024
Me asking is kind of a sign.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.528
Yes! Yes! Yes!

21:19.144 --> 21:21.476
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.545
Here's your key. Here's your key.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.376
Now go out and christen it!

21:25.584 --> 21:27.017
Go out and come back in!

21:27.219 --> 21:29.744
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.315
-Ready?
-Ready!

21:34.493 --> 21:37.053
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.992
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

21:40.198 --> 21:42.860
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very old key!

21:43.068 --> 21:45.400
-It's an old key!
-Oh, my God, it's old!

21:46.271 --> 21:47.499
I love you.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.069
I love you.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.770
Are you hugging the door right now?

22:00.285 --> 22:01.513
No.

22:02.788 --> 22:04.585
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.754
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

22:11.963 --> 22:14.932
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.430
Ross, thank you.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.703
Do you wanna go see a movie?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.702
-Yeah, why not?
-Phoebe?

22:21.907 --> 22:23.772
No, thanks.
I've already seen one.

22:25.243 --> 22:27.108
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.479
You wanna hear something weird?

22:33.719 --> 22:35.050
Always.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.816
I didn't get the annulment.

22:40.592 --> 22:41.581
What?

22:41.793 --> 22:43.385
We're still married.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.655
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.069
What are you doing?

23:01.279 --> 23:02.746
Key is stuck in the lock.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.506
I can fix it. Hold on.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.052
Watch out, watch out.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.553
It still doesn't work.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.227
I'm not finished.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.300
Nice job, Joe.
You're quite the craftsman!
