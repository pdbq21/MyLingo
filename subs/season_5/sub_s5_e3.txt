WEBVTT

00:05.805 --> 00:09.070
I'm Phoebe Buffay, and I have
babies coming out.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.877
Have you started having contractions?

00:12.078 --> 00:14.945
Not yet. I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

00:16.282 --> 00:17.681
Oh, my God!

00:18.852 --> 00:20.342
Which of you is the father?

00:20.587 --> 00:23.579
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.691
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

00:31.498 --> 00:34.092
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.962
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

00:38.671 --> 00:41.970
Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.

00:42.275 --> 00:45.335
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me!

00:48.114 --> 00:49.547
What took you so long?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.978
Your cab left when ours did.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.485
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

01:03.496 --> 01:04.986
You're not wearing one.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.323
Oh, man!
I did it again!

01:09.736 --> 01:12.000
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.468
My mom might
What are you doing?

01:14.674 --> 01:16.801
I've got to get the "before" shot!

01:20.814 --> 01:22.509
The One Hundredth

02:08.261 --> 02:12.129
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

02:12.332 --> 02:14.391
...is because she's not coming.

02:15.401 --> 02:17.562
She hit her head in the shower.

02:18.238 --> 02:21.230
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

02:21.674 --> 02:23.539
Phoebe, it's gonna be okay.

02:23.743 --> 02:27.543
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina!

02:31.084 --> 02:34.212
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.285
He's head of the department.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.083
All right. Oh, dear God, save me!

02:39.359 --> 02:41.452
I'm having my first contraction!

02:42.228 --> 02:43.718
Oh, it's not bad.

02:46.099 --> 02:50.433
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And l

02:50.703 --> 02:51.692
You okay?

02:52.972 --> 02:54.030
Something hurts.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.107
It's sympathy pains.
That's so sweet!

02:57.777 --> 02:59.642
I didn't know I cared that much.

03:03.950 --> 03:07.579
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

03:07.787 --> 03:11.120
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.757
I'll be back to do your internal.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.155
Just relax, everything looks great.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.990
And also, I love Fonzie.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.827
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

03:25.104 --> 03:26.901
That's what it sounded like.

03:27.674 --> 03:28.766
All right.

03:33.012 --> 03:36.140
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

03:36.516 --> 03:39.144
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

03:39.352 --> 03:42.788
Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.991
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

03:46.859 --> 03:49.419
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

03:49.629 --> 03:51.494
...you get two percent financing.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.363
Monica, you're gonna be
very proud of me.

03:59.606 --> 04:03.167
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.775
Oh, my!

04:06.145 --> 04:07.942
They're male nurses.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.109
Not in my head.

04:10.817 --> 04:14.844
They want to take us out
Saturday night! What do you say?

04:20.159 --> 04:21.558
I don't think so.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.862
What are you talking about?

04:24.130 --> 04:27.861
You've been telling me
to get over Ross and move on.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.160
I'm moving on and so are you.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.860
Why don't you want to go?

04:34.340 --> 04:36.900
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

04:37.143 --> 04:39.475
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.081
-What?
-Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

04:44.751 --> 04:47.219
You're coming.
And when they get off...

04:47.520 --> 04:49.750
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.519
There's always room for Jello.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.930
How do you make that dirty?

04:59.165 --> 05:01.725
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.535
Grandma's chicken salad....

05:15.014 --> 05:16.845
Get a shot of this.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.348
These are the headlines
when you were born.

05:20.553 --> 05:24.284
Now, girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

05:24.557 --> 05:26.218
...check it out!

05:27.093 --> 05:29.618
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

05:29.862 --> 05:32.456
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.425
Okay, I'm having another one!

05:36.636 --> 05:39.571
This one doesn't hurt eith
Yes, it does!

05:45.311 --> 05:47.302
I was kind of hoping that was it.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.279
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

05:52.485 --> 05:54.953
A couple of nurses asked them out.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.122
Really? Male nurses?

05:57.323 --> 05:59.314
Yeah, I was bummed too.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.491
So they're going on dates.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.391
-When?
-I think Saturday.

06:06.933 --> 06:09.561
-What's with him?
-Sympathy pains.

06:10.002 --> 06:14.336
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.834
Let's see what we got here.

06:19.645 --> 06:22.671
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.183
This Fonzie person
you keep referring to...

06:27.487 --> 06:29.512
...is that another doctor?

06:29.789 --> 06:30.813
Oh, no, no.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.755
Fonzie is the nickname
of Arthur Fonzerelli.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.185
The Fonz.

06:38.965 --> 06:39.954
All right.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.300
It's not that weird, is it?

06:46.773 --> 06:48.263
It's very weird!

06:48.474 --> 06:53.138
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

06:55.515 --> 06:58.348
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie

06:58.618 --> 06:59.710
What are you doing?

07:01.154 --> 07:04.453
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

07:04.657 --> 07:06.682
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

07:07.360 --> 07:08.452
Again, it's not

07:16.068 --> 07:17.968
Hey, there you are!

07:18.471 --> 07:20.302
There's something you should know.

07:20.506 --> 07:23.498
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

07:23.743 --> 07:27.201
I am so fine. You and l,
we're just nothing.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.046
Just goofing around.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.755
I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

07:37.023 --> 07:40.823
But if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.153
Fine. Maybe I will too.

07:45.598 --> 07:49.090
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.733
Get up! Get up! Get up!

07:58.277 --> 07:59.869
This is Dr. Oberman.

08:00.379 --> 08:03.007
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

08:03.216 --> 08:06.344
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.411
You're going into what grade?

08:10.590 --> 08:14.117
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

08:14.393 --> 08:15.724
Me too.

08:17.096 --> 08:20.395
I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.792
Really, I'm fully qualified

08:23.035 --> 08:24.059
Doogie!

08:26.639 --> 08:30.939
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon?

08:31.644 --> 08:33.612
Go, little boy! Go!

08:37.450 --> 08:39.782
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

08:44.757 --> 08:49.091
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.659
Well, what else could it be?

08:51.931 --> 08:53.899
It's kidney stones.

08:54.901 --> 08:55.890
Or....

08:56.102 --> 08:57.729
Kidney stones.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.806
-lf it was something else?
-Well, that would be "kidney stones."

09:08.114 --> 09:09.445
You're getting there.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.879
These babies are very, very lucky.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.176
They are? Why?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.480
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.618
Happy Birthday.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.128
Just to clarify...

09:23.329 --> 09:24.990
...I'm not Fonzie.

09:33.806 --> 09:38.140
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.005
No, it is.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.711
Can I tell you a secret?

09:43.749 --> 09:45.649
I want to keep one.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.524
Oh, I'm gonna be on the news.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.022
You must be kidding.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.890
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.089
Maybe I can. You don't know.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.327
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.972
Maybe not. You know?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.499
Three babies are a handful.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.974
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.707
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.114
Phoebe, no.
This is insane.

10:23.322 --> 10:24.448
Just ask him.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.352
What? Me?

10:26.826 --> 10:27.815
I can't ask him!

10:28.060 --> 10:31.393
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

10:32.732 --> 10:35.223
All I'm saying is,
just talk to Frank.

10:35.434 --> 10:36.765
Just feel him out.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.564
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.499
You're right.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.981
Tell him it's for you.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.944
Feeling better, sweetie?

10:55.187 --> 10:56.916
Maybe a little.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.920
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

11:00.459 --> 11:01.687
Me too.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.297
I just heard. What's up?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.364
Kidney stones!

11:11.637 --> 11:15.630
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.241
But they're too close to the bladder.

11:18.444 --> 11:22.471
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra

11:25.685 --> 11:28.848
No, no, no, no.
Nothing is going up, okay?

11:30.322 --> 11:33.655
Up is not an option.
What's a urethra?

11:36.862 --> 11:37.988
Are you crazy?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.161
Did you ask him?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.269
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.132
I'm kind of on a clock here.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.634
Oh, Fonzie.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.547
You know who I always liked?
Mork.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.677
Undo it. Undo it.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.681
Fonzie met Mork.

12:06.992 --> 12:08.892
Mork froze Fonzie.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.229
But Fonzie was already cool.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.338
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.841
Yeah, that's right.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.277
How you doing?

12:28.547 --> 12:31.015
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

12:31.217 --> 12:34.709
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

12:35.020 --> 12:39.855
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

12:41.594 --> 12:45.189
Sorry, I'm in the middle of
the last favor you asked me to do.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.866
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're dating on Saturday.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.699
Nice to meet you.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.904
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really!

13:07.086 --> 13:08.417
So, Dan...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.589
...nurse, not a doctor, huh?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.757
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

13:16.262 --> 13:20.164
That's okay. I'm doing this
to get through medical school.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.996
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.666
Sure.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.340
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.080
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

13:40.286 --> 13:42.151
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.946
Great!

13:44.156 --> 13:46.124
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

13:46.325 --> 13:48.350
-No.
-All right, very good!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.124
This is a big one.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.592
Get these things out of me!

13:59.605 --> 14:02.768
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.971
I want the drugs, Ross!

14:08.180 --> 14:10.842
I do too! I do too!

14:13.853 --> 14:16.879
Yeah, I love you.
Okay, bye.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.126
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.656
She should be here.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.558
She'll make it on time.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.700
So, Frank...

14:30.035 --> 14:33.232
...three babies.
That just seems like a lot, huh?

14:33.672 --> 14:35.299
Not to me.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.200
Fair enough.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.576
You're at ten centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.549
I want only the father here.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.119
-We love you.
-Good luck.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.190
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.800
What is that?

15:07.773 --> 15:08.762
Oh, my God!

15:08.908 --> 15:12.366
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.609
Ready? Time to try pushing.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.712
Ready? Time to try peeing.

15:21.987 --> 15:26.253
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.587
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

15:31.297 --> 15:32.423
I see the head.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.462
Yes, it has a head!

15:36.235 --> 15:37.497
Keep pushing. Come on.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.000
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

15:40.406 --> 15:42.601
There's somebody coming out of you!

15:43.342 --> 15:45.970
-It's my son!
-All right.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.604
Here's your first baby!

15:54.186 --> 15:55.813
Yes! We got a baby boy!

15:57.690 --> 15:59.681
Frank Junior, Junior!

16:00.326 --> 16:01.623
How does he look?

16:01.827 --> 16:03.158
So gross!

16:06.665 --> 16:08.633
Okay. You ready to push again?

16:08.934 --> 16:11.164
I already had a baby.
Leave me alone!

16:11.370 --> 16:14.703
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it!

16:24.616 --> 16:27.210
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

16:28.120 --> 16:31.612
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.523
How scary is that?

16:38.197 --> 16:42.691
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.003
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!

16:50.142 --> 16:52.042
Hey, where's his thing?

16:56.248 --> 16:57.806
Chandler's a girl!

16:59.818 --> 17:02.309
Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.

17:03.589 --> 17:07.252
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.550
But Chandler's a girl!

17:09.762 --> 17:11.423
Okay, keep saying it.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.890
-Am I too late?
-No, no. Everything's okay.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.535
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.198
We have our babies?

17:22.541 --> 17:23.701
We have our babies.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.216
Oh, my God!

17:40.426 --> 17:41.893
You did it, man.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.060
Would you like to see them?

17:48.634 --> 17:50.625
They're so small.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.034
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Great.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.318
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

18:08.220 --> 18:10.552
You and I are just
"goofing around."

18:10.756 --> 18:13.384
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

18:16.295 --> 18:20.493
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.393
Well, I have...

18:22.601 --> 18:26.332
...and the technical definition is:

18:26.805 --> 18:30.832
Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

18:31.844 --> 18:34.404
...and have amazing sex...

18:37.082 --> 18:40.518
...and just want to spend
more time together.

18:41.487 --> 18:45.446
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

18:45.657 --> 18:48.421
...then we have to get you
my original one.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.853
I am so bad at this.

18:54.032 --> 18:57.968
-You're better than you think you are.
-Really?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.228
Okay. So if?

18:59.371 --> 19:02.363
-Know when to stop.
-I sensed that I should stop.

19:03.609 --> 19:04.598
So we're okay?

19:06.211 --> 19:09.044
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not gonna happen.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.516
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.857
You're my favorite.

19:21.126 --> 19:24.118
-Which one do you have?
-I don't care.

19:28.734 --> 19:32.192
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.738
Did you talk to them
about, you know....

19:40.012 --> 19:42.037
No, honey.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.250
It was a long shot.

19:51.089 --> 19:54.718
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

20:17.716 --> 20:19.741
So here you are.

20:20.786 --> 20:24.586
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.592
Everyone said labor was
the hardest thing.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.856
But they were wrong. This is.

20:39.638 --> 20:42.266
Well, I had the most fun
with you guys.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.636
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.746
I'll settle for being
your favorite aunt.

20:54.620 --> 20:58.112
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

21:03.895 --> 21:05.624
Okay, so we're cool.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.763
We're gonna be great.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.299
Little high-fives.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.407
Well, if you're going to cry....

21:40.766 --> 21:44.463
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

21:44.803 --> 21:45.792
I know.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.834
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

21:50.075 --> 21:52.134
You won't be able to take it.

21:53.845 --> 21:57.303
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

21:57.516 --> 21:59.074
They'll call her Chandler.

22:00.018 --> 22:03.977
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

22:04.589 --> 22:06.682
It works on you.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.662
Maybe they can girlie it up a bit,
like Chandlerette.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.366
Alice called her Channy-fanny.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.523
Ha-ha, Channy-fanny.
