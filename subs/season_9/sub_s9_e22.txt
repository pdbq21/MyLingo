00:03.206 --> 00:05.575
Oh, that feels so good.

00:05.745 --> 00:09.617
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.

00:09.919 --> 00:11.478
-l'm sorry, what?
-l'm sorry.

00:11.690 --> 00:15.254
-Nothing. l was just reading to Emma.
-From <i>Cosmo</i>?

00:17.300 --> 00:19.794
Yeah. Yeah, it's:

00:19.973 --> 00:22.968
''Climax Your Way to Better Skin.''

00:24.014 --> 00:27.316
So l have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.

00:27.487 --> 00:29.651
l'm so bad at picking out clothes.

00:29.826 --> 00:33.994
So you need someone who knows
fashion to tell you what looks good.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.195
Not me. Not me. Not me.

00:36.372 --> 00:39.139
-Oh, hey, Rach?
-Yeah?

00:39.779 --> 00:43.013
-Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
-Oh, well....

00:43.186 --> 00:45.589
-l'm sure you have better things to do.
-You kidding?

00:45.791 --> 00:48.489
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.

00:48.664 --> 00:51.898
She's the one that taught me not
to wear white after Labor Day...

00:52.070 --> 00:56.569
...and to always, always, always put
on underwear when trying on clothes.

00:58.382 --> 01:01.081
lf you have the time,
l'd really appreciate the help.

01:01.255 --> 01:03.522
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

01:03.694 --> 01:08.260
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.703
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

01:12.444 --> 01:15.439
Okay, great. All right, bye.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.713
Pain in the ass!

01:17.922 --> 01:21.623
-That's off, right?
-What's the matter, Pheebs?

01:21.796 --> 01:25.930
Mike's sister just invited me to
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.

01:26.105 --> 01:30.638
She was like, ''Don't worry. l asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you.''

01:30.814 --> 01:34.686
So now l have to go so he'll think
that l'm totally okay with seeing him.

01:34.856 --> 01:37.692
-Which you're not. You're hung up on him.
-Exactly.

01:37.862 --> 01:41.301
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.939
l didn't even think about that.

01:44.441 --> 01:46.639
Sexual politics!

01:47.147 --> 01:49.880
Pheebs, l'm taking Charlie shopping.

01:50.053 --> 01:53.253
-Come and l'll help you find something.
-That'd be great.

01:53.459 --> 01:58.994
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.

01:59.939 --> 02:04.346
-That's not what we're gonna do.
-Why'd you ruin it? Who was l hurting?

02:55.984 --> 02:59.423
Fortunately, she has
a very pretty face.

03:03.734 --> 03:09.473
l still can't believe this. My uterus
is an inhospitable environment?

03:09.645 --> 03:12.377
l've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.

03:13.285 --> 03:15.448
l can't believe my sperm
have low motility.

03:15.657 --> 03:20.291
While l was growing up, they sure
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.197
-Hi there.
-Hi.

03:22.370 --> 03:25.433
l'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...

03:25.611 --> 03:28.377
...but l wanted to talk to you
about your options.

03:28.550 --> 03:29.575
Okay.

03:29.752 --> 03:33.817
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...

03:33.994 --> 03:36.625
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.827
Oh, damn it!

03:40.339 --> 03:44.143
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.

03:44.816 --> 03:48.654
Given your situation, the options
with the greatest chances for success...

03:48.824 --> 03:52.889
...would be surrogacy
or insemination using a sperm donor.

03:56.004 --> 04:00.274
lf you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.

04:00.446 --> 04:02.109
ls that a hint?

04:02.283 --> 04:07.955
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.

04:12.437 --> 04:15.273
Wow! Talk about
an inhospitable environment.

04:17.080 --> 04:21.384
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up
Phoebe and go shopping?

04:21.556 --> 04:24.186
-Let's do it.
-All right, have a good time.

04:24.695 --> 04:26.927
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.464
-Hey, you guys.
-Hi.

04:29.639 --> 04:34.581
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?

04:34.749 --> 04:36.479
-Chris Bailey?
-Yeah, right.

04:36.653 --> 04:41.253
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?

04:45.169 --> 04:46.502
Why are you laughing?

04:46.673 --> 04:50.305
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.115
lt's fun. Yeah.

04:53.285 --> 04:54.948
So you're up for keynote speaker?

04:55.122 --> 04:56.887
-Who's deciding?
-Professor Sherman.

04:57.060 --> 05:00.556
-l'm meeting with him today.
-He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.862
l think l know how to dazzle him.

05:03.038 --> 05:07.001
You're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?

05:07.681 --> 05:09.377
No.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.262
-Hey, guys.
-l want to ask you something.

05:20.439 --> 05:23.674
l may get to speak
at this paleontology convention.

05:23.847 --> 05:27.286
lf l do, l'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.

05:27.453 --> 05:32.556
l think l can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.095
-lt's in Barbados.
-But you come first.

05:36.271 --> 05:37.763
l'm there.

05:38.142 --> 05:42.139
-l don't know Ross, l'm not feeling too--
-Barbados is in the Caribbean, Joe.

05:42.316 --> 05:44.115
Why didn't anybody say so?

05:45.356 --> 05:46.825
-See you later.
-Okay, bye.

05:46.993 --> 05:49.463
-Bye. See you.
-Bye.

05:51.468 --> 05:55.135
-So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
-Not as much fun as last time.

05:55.309 --> 05:58.771
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.487
So, what did the doctor say?

06:01.656 --> 06:05.356
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...

06:05.530 --> 06:09.469
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.

06:09.638 --> 06:11.835
-So you're ruling out surrogacy?
-Yeah.

06:12.009 --> 06:14.002
So l don't have to learn
what that means?

06:15.316 --> 06:18.254
Aside from adoption, the only
other choice is insemination...

06:18.455 --> 06:20.482
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.360
Enough said. l'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?

06:26.238 --> 06:29.678
Your long-standing offer to have sex
with my wife is appreciated.

06:29.845 --> 06:33.615
-But l think l'll pass.
-So how do you feel about all this?

06:33.787 --> 06:38.786
l wish there was an easier way for us
to have a child, but there isn't one.

06:39.197 --> 06:42.762
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.

06:43.907 --> 06:45.398
What?

06:47.413 --> 06:50.442
What?! No!
l'm not gonna give them Ben!

06:55.162 --> 06:59.695
The data we're receiving
from MRl scans and DNA testing...

06:59.872 --> 07:01.933
...of these fossils are staggering.

07:03.312 --> 07:06.513
l mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.

07:06.686 --> 07:09.783
But if they're off
by even a 1 00,000 years or so...

07:09.959 --> 07:13.797
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...

07:13.967 --> 07:16.233
...you know, right in the trash.

07:16.404 --> 07:20.505
So, what l'm saying is....

07:20.780 --> 07:22.511
ls that....

07:22.818 --> 07:27.522
ls that repercussions could be huge.

07:27.694 --> 07:31.428
l mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...

07:31.602 --> 07:35.838
...in evolutionary biology,
genetics, geology.

07:36.011 --> 07:38.608
l mean, truly, the mind boggles.

07:42.624 --> 07:45.117
Well, that's not what you want.

07:50.105 --> 07:52.702
-lncentive for Men?
-l'll take some of that.

07:52.878 --> 07:54.541
-Pheebs, that's for men.
-l know.

07:54.715 --> 07:56.308
When l go to the party later...

07:56.484 --> 08:00.481
...Mike will know l'm over him
because l'll smell like another guy.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.027
Okay.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.497
Oh, good, l'm dating
a Russian cabdriver.

08:08.241 --> 08:11.942
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
l smell like beets.

08:14.153 --> 08:18.527
l really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?

08:18.696 --> 08:21.930
On Melanie Griffith in <i>Working Girl</i>.

08:23.138 --> 08:25.803
l think what you want is over here.

08:26.144 --> 08:28.809
See, l told you l needed someone.

08:28.983 --> 08:32.353
By the way, as a thank you,
l would really love to take you out.

08:32.524 --> 08:35.792
-Really?
-Joey and l are going to a movie tonight.

08:35.964 --> 08:38.196
-You want to come?
-Oh, l can't.

08:38.836 --> 08:41.363
Because l've seen them.

08:43.646 --> 08:46.082
You've seen all the movies?

08:46.251 --> 08:49.554
Yeah. l'm a big fan.

08:49.858 --> 08:51.190
Of the movies.

08:51.361 --> 08:53.490
You know, motion pictures.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.032
The talkies.

08:57.039 --> 08:59.441
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?

08:59.611 --> 09:00.670
-Sure.
-Okay.

09:00.847 --> 09:02.749
Maybe we could do something else.

09:02.918 --> 09:07.382
You know, that depends on what it is.
l've done a lot of stuff.

09:16.344 --> 09:19.545
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?

09:19.718 --> 09:23.658
She's okay. l don't know, l just don't
get a really good vibe from her.

09:23.826 --> 09:26.160
-Why?
-l don't know.

09:26.331 --> 09:31.467
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...

09:31.809 --> 09:33.300
...and tall, you know...

09:33.478 --> 09:36.974
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.

09:37.486 --> 09:41.221
-Who else?
-Anybody.

09:41.494 --> 09:44.364
You. Me.

09:44.601 --> 09:46.867
You know, Monica's mom.

09:49.177 --> 09:50.669
You like Joey?!

09:50.847 --> 09:52.076
Phoebe!

09:52.249 --> 09:56.485
All right, look, l do.
l have a little thing for him. Just--

09:57.259 --> 09:59.286
-Oh, my God.
-lt's just physical.

09:59.463 --> 10:03.905
l have it totally under control, okay?
lt's just when l see them together...

10:04.106 --> 10:07.237
...sometimes, l just get a little jealous.

10:07.413 --> 10:11.080
Wow. lsn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like--?

10:11.254 --> 10:12.746
l get it!

10:14.026 --> 10:16.189
All right, as long
as it's under control.

10:16.364 --> 10:19.393
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.

10:19.571 --> 10:22.041
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.

10:22.209 --> 10:24.737
l know, l know.
So it's just not a big deal.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.181
-So can we keep this between us?
-Sure.

10:27.353 --> 10:31.453
Great, because l gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.

10:37.206 --> 10:40.577
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?

10:45.957 --> 10:47.152
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

10:47.326 --> 10:50.389
l brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.868
Oh, of course. lt's so nice
to see you again, Zack.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.705
-You too.
-You guys haven't actually met before.

10:56.879 --> 10:58.746
But, boy, you're both polite.

10:58.916 --> 11:00.909
Have a seat. l'll get you a beer.

11:01.087 --> 11:02.385
-l got it.
-Thanks.

11:05.930 --> 11:09.700
-So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
-Yeah, l guess.

11:10.339 --> 11:13.972
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?

11:17.921 --> 11:18.980
Excuse me?

11:19.156 --> 11:22.618
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.

11:22.797 --> 11:27.830
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. l mean, he's sperm-tastic!

11:29.978 --> 11:33.748
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?

11:33.919 --> 11:37.221
''Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm.''

11:37.861 --> 11:41.095
l invited him to dinner so you'd get
a chance to get to know him.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.535
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.

11:44.708 --> 11:47.110
-Chandler!
-l'm telling you, he's great.

11:47.312 --> 11:51.446
l mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
l think he'd be the way to go.

11:52.891 --> 11:54.918
l'm not going to be a part of this.

11:55.095 --> 11:59.433
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.

11:59.604 --> 12:01.436
Okay.

12:02.644 --> 12:04.340
-Zack?
-Thanks.

12:04.948 --> 12:07.886
Do you have a coaster?
l don't want to make a ring.

12:08.054 --> 12:10.217
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

12:13.465 --> 12:17.064
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
lt'd be so bad if she heard.

12:17.239 --> 12:21.304
Maybe she didn't hear. l'll go into that
dressing room and talk. You stay here.

12:21.481 --> 12:23.451
-See if you can hear me.
-Okay, great.

12:26.357 --> 12:29.660
Oh, thank God,
l can't hear a word that you're saying.

12:29.831 --> 12:34.465
-l didn't say anything yet.
-Well, get back in there and talk.

12:35.810 --> 12:36.835
l'm Rachel.

12:37.012 --> 12:40.816
lt's so annoying when l put Emma
on the phone to talk with my friends.

12:41.254 --> 12:42.951
What?

12:43.124 --> 12:45.891
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.

12:47.366 --> 12:51.397
Okay, well, l heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.542
-We have a problem.
-Oh, what are we gonna do?

12:55.716 --> 12:57.549
Just be honest with her.

12:57.987 --> 12:59.513
Oh, my God!

12:59.691 --> 13:02.025
lt is annoying when parents
put babies on the phone.

13:02.195 --> 13:04.188
All right, enough out of you!

13:07.105 --> 13:08.665
Thank you.

13:14.988 --> 13:18.689
Where did l go wrong? This is good stuff.

13:26.878 --> 13:30.648
-Hello?
-l need to talk to Charlie. ls she there?

13:30.820 --> 13:33.587
No, she went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?

13:33.759 --> 13:37.722
l'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.268
-How's it going?
-lt could be better.

13:43.077 --> 13:44.569
He fell asleep.

13:44.748 --> 13:47.743
What? But l already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!

13:49.189 --> 13:51.956
-Barbados.
-Fine, l'll rent a car and drive.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.327
You have to get that job.

13:55.503 --> 13:57.803
What am l supposed to do?
He's out cold.

13:57.974 --> 14:00.673
ln fact, he was just talking
in his sleep before...

14:00.846 --> 14:05.219
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to ''spank him harder.''

14:06.357 --> 14:08.692
-Well, just wake him up.
-l can't.

14:08.862 --> 14:13.428
lf he realizes that l'm the one who
put him to sleep, l won't get the job.

14:13.605 --> 14:14.800
<i>That's a tough one.</i>

14:14.974 --> 14:18.003
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.

14:18.181 --> 14:23.419
Yeah, l was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. l--

14:23.592 --> 14:25.721
No, wait a minute.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.455
lt was me who fell asleep.

14:28.367 --> 14:32.536
l mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?

14:35.649 --> 14:39.213
-Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
-l'm gonna go wash up first.

14:39.389 --> 14:40.858
Thanks.

14:43.498 --> 14:48.270
What do you think? l want his genes
for my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

14:48.675 --> 14:52.011
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.

14:53.986 --> 14:56.320
-You don't like him.
-l think he's fine.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.757
But we don't know
anything real about him.

14:58.929 --> 15:03.267
-l wish we could get more information.
-All right, just follow my lead.

15:04.039 --> 15:07.604
-You guys have a great place here.
-Thanks. l'm crazy about our place.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.545
Hey, speaking of crazy...

15:11.187 --> 15:14.683
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?

15:15.461 --> 15:20.233
No. Although, l did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.835
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.

15:25.481 --> 15:27.451
Okay.

15:27.753 --> 15:30.725
So tell me, how'd you guys meet?

15:30.893 --> 15:34.195
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.063
l've got a better question for you:

15:36.571 --> 15:39.771
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?

15:42.048 --> 15:43.277
No.

15:43.685 --> 15:47.249
Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

15:49.564 --> 15:52.296
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?

15:52.803 --> 15:54.864
We're just making conversation.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.480
Yeah, well, okay.
l heard a joke today. lt's pretty funny.

15:58.649 --> 16:01.415
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.

16:05.295 --> 16:08.791
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and l'm flattered...

16:08.969 --> 16:11.269
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

16:11.841 --> 16:13.743
Can we just talk about something else?

16:13.912 --> 16:15.312
-Sure.
-All right.

16:16.116 --> 16:17.345
This ravioli's delicious.

16:17.586 --> 16:21.788
l notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.

16:21.962 --> 16:23.829
Did you have braces as a child?

16:24.099 --> 16:26.467
-No, l didn't.
-Yes!

16:29.510 --> 16:32.003
We're teeth people, Zack.

16:37.025 --> 16:40.521
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.429
-Good plan.
-Okay.

16:42.870 --> 16:46.537
-What? Where are you going?
-Oh, l'm sorry, Rachel.

16:46.711 --> 16:50.047
l don't have time
for your childish games, okay?

16:50.218 --> 16:52.655
l still have to find something
incredible to wear...

16:52.823 --> 16:55.989
...so l can beat Mike
at ''Who's More Over Who'' !

17:02.676 --> 17:05.112
-Where have you been?
-Trying on clothes.

17:05.281 --> 17:10.121
Oh, really? ln the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.

17:10.291 --> 17:15.564
Phoebe and l were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.

17:15.736 --> 17:18.263
Rachel, l heard you
two guys whispering.

17:18.441 --> 17:21.573
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.

17:21.748 --> 17:23.741
There's nothing to explain.
l heard you.

17:23.919 --> 17:25.912
Phoebe likes Joey.

17:30.231 --> 17:31.928
Yeah.

17:33.337 --> 17:36.138
l don't understand it.
l mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

17:36.310 --> 17:39.248
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?

17:39.416 --> 17:44.222
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.

17:44.392 --> 17:47.262
lt's, like, she's nympho.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.100
-Wow!
-Yeah.

17:50.271 --> 17:54.109
You know, by the way, l heard you
tell her not to do anything.

17:54.279 --> 17:58.618
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.

17:59.857 --> 18:01.850
l try.

18:39.035 --> 18:44.103
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?

18:44.947 --> 18:46.746
Thank you!

18:49.022 --> 18:50.719
You're welcome.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.410
Wow! You look...

19:06.356 --> 19:08.589
...stop-eating hot!

19:10.164 --> 19:12.897
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.

19:13.070 --> 19:17.408
Okay, are you sure? Because l am
really dreading going to this party.

19:17.579 --> 19:18.604
Then don't go.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.517
Mike knows l'm coming. lf l don't show up,
he'll think it's because of him...

19:22.690 --> 19:27.495
...and then l'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.

19:28.535 --> 19:33.135
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.

19:33.310 --> 19:36.841
Afterward, you come to my place
and l'll get you good and drunk.

19:37.018 --> 19:38.783
You got it. Okay.

19:38.955 --> 19:41.482
But not on the wine
that you made, okay?

19:41.661 --> 19:45.567
Because l just don't want to go back
to the emergency room.

19:48.808 --> 19:51.644
l'm sorry,
l don't seem to have enough cash.

19:52.148 --> 19:53.777
You would accept rubles, would you?

19:53.952 --> 19:58.359
This is a hundred-thousand-ruble note,
which is worth approximately...

19:58.528 --> 20:00.292
...nothing.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.505
-David?
-Phoebe! Hi.

20:04.673 --> 20:07.109
-Oh, my God!
-Hi.

20:07.780 --> 20:10.114
Wow! You look unbelievable.

20:10.284 --> 20:12.015
Oh, yeah, well....

20:14.292 --> 20:15.659
What are you doing here?

20:15.829 --> 20:18.801
Well, l'm back from Minsk.
Permanently.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.163
Well, what happened?

20:20.337 --> 20:22.170
Remember how l was trying
to achieve...

20:22.341 --> 20:25.211
...the positronic distillation
of subatomic particles?

20:25.381 --> 20:26.850
Yeah.

20:27.018 --> 20:30.549
Well, after eight years of research,
l discovered...

20:30.725 --> 20:33.218
...that it can't be done.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.066
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.569
This kind of thing happens
all the time in science.

20:37.739 --> 20:42.043
To people who base eight years of research
on a typo in a scientific journal.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.845
Well...

20:44.553 --> 20:47.251
...great that you're back. How are you?

20:47.425 --> 20:49.327
-Good. Good. Life is good.
-Good.

20:49.496 --> 20:51.865
Well, l'm seeing someone.

20:53.571 --> 20:55.062
-Good for you.
-Yeah.

20:55.241 --> 20:59.615
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and....

20:59.817 --> 21:02.253
lt's actually because of you
that we're together.

21:02.421 --> 21:05.291
l mean, l saw what you had
with that Mike guy...

21:05.461 --> 21:07.557
...and l just said, ''Boy, l want that.''

21:08.200 --> 21:11.070
-Mike and l broke up.
-You're kidding me.

21:11.239 --> 21:15.373
Because l'm not seeing anybody.
l just totally made that up.

21:15.549 --> 21:17.576
-Really?
-l don't know why, l'm sorry.

21:17.753 --> 21:20.383
l guess l just didn't want
to lose face.

21:20.659 --> 21:22.788
l understand.

21:23.230 --> 21:26.396
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay....

21:26.571 --> 21:30.476
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.

21:30.645 --> 21:32.911
-That's so not like us.
-Yeah, l know.

21:33.083 --> 21:37.616
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...

21:37.793 --> 21:40.663
...but do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?

21:40.832 --> 21:42.357
Well....

21:43.170 --> 21:44.799
No.

21:46.109 --> 21:49.138
-Well, do you want to get a drink?
-l'd love to.

21:49.315 --> 21:51.285
-Great.
-Okay.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.288
Do you smell beets?

21:56.463 --> 21:59.196
All right, stay upwind of me.

22:01.439 --> 22:05.174
Hey, there's Phoebe.
ls that Mike she's with?

22:05.715 --> 22:07.878
No, that's David.

22:08.053 --> 22:10.820
There's a third guy?

22:11.259 --> 22:14.493
Tip of the iceberg.

22:17.271 --> 22:18.763
l'm gonna take off now.

22:18.975 --> 22:21.503
You're gonna let me go home,
aren't you?

22:21.981 --> 22:24.042
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?

22:24.218 --> 22:26.347
No, l should get home.
l'm kind of tired.

22:26.524 --> 22:28.220
Are you always tired?

22:28.393 --> 22:31.263
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.738
No, it's tiring to figure out the age
at which all my grandparents died.

22:37.713 --> 22:39.706
-l'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

22:39.883 --> 22:41.512
Bye.

22:42.388 --> 22:44.552
l think we found our sperm.

22:45.562 --> 22:47.087
He does seem pretty perfect.

22:47.264 --> 22:49.633
Yeah? You think so?
Should l ask him?

22:52.308 --> 22:53.333
No.

22:53.544 --> 22:56.140
Why not? Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?

22:56.316 --> 22:58.981
Our kid's gonna get that
from you anyway.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.319
No, that's not it.

23:03.497 --> 23:07.962
lt's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...

23:08.140 --> 23:13.048
...l just realized l don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.

23:13.216 --> 23:16.883
-He's not you.
-Yeah, he's better!

23:18.528 --> 23:20.725
No, he's not.

23:20.899 --> 23:25.237
lf l can't get pregnant with you, then
l don't want to get pregnant by him...

23:25.407 --> 23:27.001
...or anyone else.

23:28.380 --> 23:31.876
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yeah, l'm sure.

23:32.054 --> 23:34.490
Thank God, because l
don't wanna do this either.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.860
l was just doing it because l thought
that was what you wanted.

23:38.033 --> 23:41.632
l'm the husband.
l'm supposed to bring the sperm.

23:42.742 --> 23:44.370
That is so sweet.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.647
l love you.

23:50.257 --> 23:52.386
So you know this leaves us with....

23:53.063 --> 23:54.862
Adoption.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.898
How do you feel about that?

23:58.373 --> 24:00.970
l think l feel okay about it.

24:01.379 --> 24:04.819
Actually, l think l feel
really good about it.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.413
Me too.

24:07.592 --> 24:11.930
l wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and l wanna raise it with you.

24:12.101 --> 24:15.802
And l wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.

24:17.478 --> 24:20.849
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?

24:21.553 --> 24:22.919
Yeah.

24:23.423 --> 24:27.694
-Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
-We are gonna be great parents.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.129
And it could be soon.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.468
l mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...

24:32.876 --> 24:35.312
...our baby could be being conceived.

24:35.480 --> 24:40.013
Wait. lf we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...

24:40.190 --> 24:43.857
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.

24:49.543 --> 24:50.636
Hey, Zack.

24:50.812 --> 24:52.975
Hey, Chandler.

24:53.149 --> 24:54.982
l wanted to apologize for last night.

24:55.153 --> 24:57.522
l got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.

24:57.692 --> 24:58.853
-No, you didn't.
-Really?

24:59.028 --> 25:00.725
No, you did.

25:00.898 --> 25:03.563
My wife and l have
some boundary issues.

25:03.771 --> 25:05.866
Sometimes we ask
inappropriate questions.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.636
We're working on it.

25:07.812 --> 25:11.148
-Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
-Thank you.

25:13.390 --> 25:17.091
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?
