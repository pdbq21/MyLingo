WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.399
Did we get paper towels?

00:03.570 --> 00:05.595
You mean the thing
we went to the store for?

00:05.772 --> 00:07.205
Nope.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.868
Hey, I got you a present!

00:11.078 --> 00:13.478
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?

00:13.680 --> 00:17.377
I ordered it for your wedding
and it's finally here!

00:17.584 --> 00:20.144
You didn't have to get us anything..

00:20.387 --> 00:23.185
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!

00:25.926 --> 00:29.919
-It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
-Oh, my God!

00:30.130 --> 00:32.189
I didn't know where to put it.

00:32.432 --> 00:36.198
-We can put it in the guest bedroom.
-Yeah, okay.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.764
I kind of like it here.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.169
Do you like it?

00:43.410 --> 00:47.312
I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.847
-This was my second favorite.
-What's your first?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.612
-I don't remember the name.
-Well, what did it do?

00:54.821 --> 00:59.986
You'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.457
A vending machine?

01:02.663 --> 01:06.429
Don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

01:43.804 --> 01:46.136
I'm so glad you guys are here.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.867
Guess what happened
in the paleontology department.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.876
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

01:54.114 --> 01:58.244
Professor Newman, the department head,
is retiring, so..

01:58.485 --> 02:03.548
-They made you head of the department!
-I'm teaching his advanced class!

02:04.625 --> 02:07.150
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

02:07.327 --> 02:09.852
Great. You've always wanted
to teach an advanced class.

02:10.030 --> 02:14.228
No, I know. It's really exciting.
This is the break I've been waiting for.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.801
I'm not sure a court-ordered
detox program..

02:16.970 --> 02:19.905
was the break
Professor Newman was waiting for.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.062
But, hey.

02:22.275 --> 02:27.076
Hey, Rach, I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

02:27.981 --> 02:32.384
Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.917
Great, thanks.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.613
Then take her to the
Four Seasons for drinks.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.590
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.389
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

02:44.598 --> 02:48.159
You sure are naming
a lot of ways to postpone sex.

02:49.302 --> 02:53.432
I miss dating. Dressing up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

02:54.141 --> 02:58.544
I won't be able to do that for so long.
And it's so much fun.

02:58.979 --> 03:03.416
Not that sitting around
worrying about giving birth isn't fun.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.615
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.857
You don't want to date
a pregnant lady.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.855
Yes, I do. We're gonna
have a good time.

03:15.128 --> 03:19.565
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections..

03:19.800 --> 03:22.064
and baby heads stretching out..

03:22.302 --> 03:23.929
Okay, I'll go with you.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.571
-It will be fun.
-All right.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.672
No, no! Yes!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.670
Would you look at that.

03:31.945 --> 03:35.176
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.679
Okay, I'm next.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.215
Don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

03:40.487 --> 03:44.446
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.319
-Phoebe's hogging the game.
-It's a stupid game.

03:48.528 --> 03:51.463
You think it's stupid because
you suck.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.599
I don't suck. It sucks.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.098
You suck.

03:59.172 --> 04:03.404
If this game is gonna cause problems,
I should keep it.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.477
No, I love it. It is a great present.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.776
Why don't you go home and wait
for the thank-you card?

04:11.017 --> 04:16.284
-Why do you want to play this game?
-It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.

04:16.890 --> 04:20.189
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.992
Phoebe!
Chandler!

04:24.164 --> 04:28.066
No, no. This is a girl fight.
I'm hoping it will turn into love-play.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.100
Okay, look.
Honey, I'm sorry..

04:33.273 --> 04:37.141
I'm acting hostile. I don't mean to.
It's just that I love this game so much..

04:37.310 --> 04:39.870
that I would just like
the chance to play it too.

04:40.046 --> 04:43.379
Wow, it's amazing how well I can play
with you yapping around my head..

04:43.550 --> 04:44.539
like a Chihuahua.

04:46.086 --> 04:49.385
All right, that's it. Chandler,
help me get her out of the chair.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.318
Chandler, come on.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.236
Joey, could you get that?

05:08.742 --> 05:09.868
Joey.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.284
I thought you were in your room.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.923
I'm picking you up for our date.
For you.

05:25.592 --> 05:28.993
Lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.231
And a brownie.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.696
Well, half a brownie.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.063
Actually, it's just a bag.

05:38.271 --> 05:43.072
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I felt faint, so..

05:43.743 --> 05:48.271
This is so great! I actually feel
like I'm on a real date.

05:48.515 --> 05:53.714
But I have morning sickness and
I have on underwear that goes up to..

05:53.920 --> 05:55.410
there.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.420
Hey, come on. This is a real date.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.092
So nice place you got here.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.420
Football. Pizza box.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.624
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
My kind of woman.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.804
That's my roommate's.

06:12.005 --> 06:15.805
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

06:16.009 --> 06:20.173
He's protective of me,
so you'd better watch yourself.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.247
Your roommate, is he good-looking?

06:25.318 --> 06:28.515
Must be tough to keep your hands
off him.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.887
I'm pretty sure he's gay.

06:31.825 --> 06:36.057
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

06:37.831 --> 06:41.631
Which brings us back
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.796
That's it for today.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.468
Does anyone know where
the Freeman Building is?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.972
It's the new building on Avenue A.

06:50.176 --> 06:54.203
That's across town.
I'm teaching there in 10 minutes.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.575
Dude, that's not gonna happen.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.480
Move it! Move it!

07:01.721 --> 07:04.189
Hey! I'm the teacher!

07:17.737 --> 07:19.500
Hello.

07:23.410 --> 07:27.847
Sorry I'm a little late.
Whoa, a lot late.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.814
Well, let me start
by introducing myself.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.418
I'm Professor Geller.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.889
So to sum up..

07:38.124 --> 07:42.083
I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.

07:44.831 --> 07:48.699
-What comes with the filet mignon?
-Steamed vegetables.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.829
Instead of the vegetables..

07:54.074 --> 07:58.340
is there any way that I could
substitute the..

07:58.578 --> 08:00.705
three-pound lobster?

08:02.349 --> 08:04.476
You know what? Bring her both.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.083
And I'll have the same.

08:07.387 --> 08:11.346
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.584
I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.058
No roommate stuff. It's a date.

08:17.263 --> 08:21.893
Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.397
Have any moves?

08:23.603 --> 08:28.006
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for..

08:30.477 --> 08:33.571
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.981
I knew it. Tell me your moves.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.775
All right.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.247
Well..

08:40.487 --> 08:45.288
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.950
Oh, my God. And that works?

08:49.162 --> 08:54.498
If you add, "This is embarrassing.
I just want to have a normal life."

08:54.701 --> 08:57.192
You poor little famous man.

08:57.604 --> 09:00.038
Okay, how about this one?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.966
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you..

09:04.144 --> 09:07.773
but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.115
Oh, my God!

09:13.153 --> 09:17.419
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. Really.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.785
So tell me one of your moves.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.984
All right.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.355
So where'd you grow up?

09:28.134 --> 09:29.795
That's your move?

09:30.503 --> 09:32.869
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

09:33.073 --> 09:37.032
-Come on, just answer the question.
-Queens.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.641
Were you close to your parents?

09:39.979 --> 09:43.073
-With my mom. Not so much my dad.
-Why not?

09:43.316 --> 09:46.342
I don't know.
There's just this distance.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.147
We both try to pretend it's not there,
but it is.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.315
It's gotta be rough.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.496
Yeah, it's really tough.
Sometimes I think..

09:57.697 --> 09:59.562
Wow!

10:01.668 --> 10:04.831
Nice move!

10:05.071 --> 10:08.666
-"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
-Thank you.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.900
Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna use the restroom.

10:14.881 --> 10:19.079
-Now you're watching me walk away.
-Yes, I am! So simple!

10:23.656 --> 10:28.150
-You won't believe what I did today.
-Clearly not shower or shave.

10:28.361 --> 10:31.728
I played this all day,
and now I rule.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.365
They should change the name
to "Ms. Chandler."

10:37.203 --> 10:39.433
Although, I hope they don't.

10:39.672 --> 10:44.974
You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went to work like a chump?

10:45.211 --> 10:50.080
I got the top 1 0 scores. I erased
Phoebe off the board. High-five!

10:51.484 --> 10:54.453
What is the matter with your hand?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.382
I played for eight hours.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.493
It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.

11:02.695 --> 11:06.096
Also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

11:06.332 --> 11:10.530
-Chandler, why would you do that?
-Because it's awesome.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.329
You think it's clever?

11:12.539 --> 11:17.704
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.907
But clearly you're up to the task.

11:21.347 --> 11:25.249
-This one's not dirty.
-Put it together with that one.

11:25.451 --> 11:26.713
Oh.

11:26.953 --> 11:31.890
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.189
Ben's coming over tomorrow.
This can't be there.

11:35.395 --> 11:39.263
-He won't know what they mean.
-He's 7, not stupid.

11:39.465 --> 11:43.799
-Have you talked to him lately?
-I'm gonna unplug it.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.734
I'll have nothing to show for my day.
Like work.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.705
No!

11:50.743 --> 11:52.802
Hey, look! It's still there!

11:53.046 --> 11:56.812
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip!

11:57.250 --> 12:00.617
Wow. The dirty words
and the computer talk.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.687
This is just the coolest
you've ever been.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.283
-You gotta beat your scores.
-With the claw?

12:07.493 --> 12:10.929
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off.

12:11.164 --> 12:15.123
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

12:15.401 --> 12:19.064
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

12:22.609 --> 12:27.205
-I am not gonna answer that.
-Oh, come on. Just pick one.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.974
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross..

12:31.184 --> 12:33.709
if you had to,
who would you punch?

12:34.320 --> 12:37.551
We're friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.718
Chandler?

12:39.993 --> 12:42.723
Yeah, but I don't know why.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.057
-I'm having a wonderful time!
-Me too!

12:47.300 --> 12:51.134
-This is the best date I ever had.
-I know!

12:51.337 --> 12:55.000
I laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.870
Joey, I think everybody saw it.

12:58.478 --> 13:03.643
I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

13:03.850 --> 13:08.719
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.148
All right. Now don't judge me.

13:12.392 --> 13:17.022
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but I'm ripping into the swan.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.960
Okay, then you don't judge me.

13:20.166 --> 13:23.693
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from that brownie.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.575
Oh, yeah.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.507
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

13:41.854 --> 13:45.654
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me..

13:45.892 --> 13:49.293
first, I make my lips
look irresistible.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.757
How do you do it?

13:51.130 --> 13:54.896
Now you can't tell anyone, but..

13:55.168 --> 13:58.569
I put on shiny lip balm.

13:59.205 --> 14:04.336
-Oh, my God.
-Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.280
-Okay, now you go.
-No, I don't want to tell you.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.346
-Why not?
-It's embarrassing.

14:10.717 --> 14:14.346
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.086
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

14:18.591 --> 14:21.788
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.153
Okay.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.387
All right, stand up.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.166
Well, when we're at the door..

14:30.403 --> 14:35.238
I lightly press my lips
against his.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.673
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.403
And then I make this sound:

14:48.054 --> 14:51.080
It doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.555
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

14:55.695 --> 15:00.257
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.363
Me too.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.219
You were 50 minutes late?
Did you crawl?

15:23.623 --> 15:26.251
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

15:26.526 --> 15:30.724
When did people stop understanding
"Get out of my way"?

15:31.397 --> 15:33.297
Why didn't you take a cab?

15:33.533 --> 15:38.436
With the traffic and one-way streets,
it'd take me twice as long.

15:38.704 --> 15:43.437
And I have class three times a week.
Who am I, Rockefeller?

15:44.243 --> 15:46.643
You won't be able to keep doing this.

15:46.879 --> 15:50.576
If I don't, they'll take the class
away from me.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.809
And I put it in my family newsletter.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.382
-Your what?
-You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.886
Right. Wow.

16:03.095 --> 16:08.260
I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

16:08.534 --> 16:13.665
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.575
-Hey.
-Hi!

16:17.977 --> 16:20.844
Remember when we talked about Cujo?

16:21.080 --> 16:24.345
I can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.575
Relax, it isn't Citizen Kane.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.949
Have you ever sat through
Citizen Kane?

16:30.189 --> 16:34.250
Yeah, it's really boring.
But it's, like, a big deal.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.822
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.464
Well, let's do it tonight.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.261
-Don't you have that big date?
-Oh, right.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.871
-Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.973
After our date, did you feel weird?

16:51.177 --> 16:55.876
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

16:56.115 --> 17:01.610
I don't know. I'm kind of thinking
it was the lobster.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.650
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.227
-I was up sick all night.
-Me too. All night.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.160
Really? We didn't cross paths.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.302
Yeah, well, that's because..

17:17.503 --> 17:19.994
I stayed in my room.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.637
You don't want to look
in my hamper.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.871
Okay, I got that.

17:30.149 --> 17:33.118
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.049
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.382
Well, you're just a little bitch,
aren't you?!

17:43.529 --> 17:45.554
Hey, you guys?

17:45.831 --> 17:49.267
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

17:49.468 --> 17:52.631
But if you don't get off soon,
I will cut you.

17:54.840 --> 18:00.870
Oh, my God! Your friends have
some unfortunate initials.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.547
They're all Chandler.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.080
Chandler couldn't get this good.

18:05.318 --> 18:10.153
I did. But it came at a price.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.485
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.151
By age 7, kids have
already seen orgies.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.825
Was it just me?

18:26.505 --> 18:27.904
So..

18:28.074 --> 18:29.598
we're about out of time.

18:29.775 --> 18:34.235
Now, I know I've given
you a lot of new information.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.145
And it may seem
a little overwhelming.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.212
But, if there's one thing..

18:43.389 --> 18:45.653
you need to take away
from class today..

18:48.260 --> 18:49.488
it's that..

18:49.662 --> 18:53.063
dinosaurs ain't never coming back.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.101
I'll see you next time.

19:09.215 --> 19:12.878
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

19:17.490 --> 19:20.584
Okay, why don't we all..

19:22.595 --> 19:25.393
open our books to page 23..

19:25.631 --> 19:27.064
where..

19:28.501 --> 19:31.436
where you will see..

19:33.305 --> 19:37.401
a bunch of red spots.

19:38.878 --> 19:43.815
Okay, why don't you all start to read
while I..

19:50.756 --> 19:52.621
This is so embarrassing.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.818
I just want to have a normal life.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.926
Wow, that's an expensive
bottle of wine.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.032
It is?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.532
That's funny, my fans
don't normally do that.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.504
Are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.173
No, no, I'm fine. It's just..

20:19.985 --> 20:22.453
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:22.688 --> 20:25.555
Have you ever looked at someone
you know..

20:25.825 --> 20:29.352
and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.587
You mean like from behind?

20:36.102 --> 20:39.538
Yeah. That's exactly it.

20:39.739 --> 20:44.039
I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

20:44.276 --> 20:48.007
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

20:49.115 --> 20:50.446
Yeah.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.116
So you know exactly what I mean.

20:53.352 --> 20:56.617
Totally! Wow.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.681
-Would you excuse me?
-Sure.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.296
-Phoebe! You're on fire!
-I know!

21:15.574 --> 21:16.802
You can do it!

21:17.042 --> 21:19.033
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

21:19.245 --> 21:21.543
Go left! Go right! Go right!

21:21.747 --> 21:23.408
I can't! I can't!

21:23.649 --> 21:26.812
No! You son of a..

21:39.899 --> 21:41.628
Phoebe?!

21:42.134 --> 21:45.900
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

21:55.147 --> 21:58.810
Thank God you're home!
I'm watching Cujo.

21:59.051 --> 22:03.647
-Alone?
-Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

22:03.956 --> 22:07.983
Did you get to the part where Cujo
throws himself at the car?

22:08.194 --> 22:12.130
No, seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.830
Wait, what happened to your date?

22:15.267 --> 22:17.428
Oh, it didn't work out.

22:17.636 --> 22:22.335
-Want to watch the rest of the movie?
-Oh, okay. Yeah.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.940
I never thought I'd say this..

22:25.177 --> 22:27.441
but I hope this dog dies.

22:29.615 --> 22:32.607
What are you doing?
Sit here. Protect me.

22:32.818 --> 22:36.015
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

22:40.159 --> 22:41.592
Okay.

22:46.398 --> 22:50.232
-That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
-I know.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.861
It's gonna be okay.

22:54.139 --> 22:59.406
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.715
How can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

23:08.554 --> 23:10.613
Terrified.

23:20.666 --> 23:25.501
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

23:25.771 --> 23:26.795
Let us begin.

23:27.306 --> 23:33.176
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.041
Here..

23:37.650 --> 23:39.117
and..

23:39.985 --> 23:41.111
here.

23:41.987 --> 23:44.820
Now, as for the hydrosaurs..
