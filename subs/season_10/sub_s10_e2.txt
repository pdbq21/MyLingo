WEBVTT

00:13.541 --> 00:15.055
Okay, Ross.

00:15.262 --> 00:18.736
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but...

00:18.906 --> 00:22.299
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

00:22.670 --> 00:24.981
Rach, he just saw us.

00:28.235 --> 00:31.549
But what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

00:31.759 --> 00:35.232
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

00:37.404 --> 00:39.362
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

00:39.527 --> 00:42.248
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that that happened...

00:42.409 --> 00:44.163
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

00:44.371 --> 00:47.970
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

00:50.057 --> 00:54.578
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

00:54.742 --> 00:58.055
- But...
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.345
Yeah. But it did happen.

01:01.909 --> 01:03.229
So...

01:07.595 --> 01:08.870
Ross?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.520
Ross?

01:21.849 --> 01:24.525
Can we just close the door?

01:25.533 --> 01:27.571
The One Where Ross Is Fine

02:00.888 --> 02:02.608
Ross, say something.

02:02.770 --> 02:04.170
Anything.

02:05.773 --> 02:07.652
So you two are...?

02:08.656 --> 02:10.136
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:11.138 --> 02:13.176
And have you had...?

02:13.380 --> 02:16.261
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

02:16.463 --> 02:18.661
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you...?

02:18.866 --> 02:20.699
Probably...
No. No.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.832
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

02:26.033 --> 02:27.866
You have every right
to go nuts.

02:28.075 --> 02:30.193
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

02:30.397 --> 02:32.196
No, but you know what I mean.

02:36.644 --> 02:38.955
If you two are happy...

02:39.126 --> 02:42.201
...then I'm happy for you.

02:43.010 --> 02:45.082
I'm fine.

02:46.293 --> 02:48.411
- Really?
- Absolutely.

02:48.576 --> 02:50.853
I'm fine.

02:51.178 --> 02:52.693
Totally fine.

02:52.860 --> 02:56.173
I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

02:56.343 --> 02:59.224
...because, really, I'm fine.

03:01.949 --> 03:07.472
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.

03:07.675 --> 03:09.872
I mean, at first I was like:

03:12.439 --> 03:16.402
But now that I've had time
to absorb it...

03:17.685 --> 03:19.199
Loving this.

03:21.288 --> 03:24.249
- Ross...
- It's all working out.

03:24.852 --> 03:27.892
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

03:28.095 --> 03:31.056
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.054
No.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.254
We should all have dinner.

03:35.422 --> 03:38.337
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

03:38.866 --> 03:41.177
Look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

03:41.348 --> 03:43.181
Weird? What? What's weird?

03:43.350 --> 03:46.505
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

03:46.674 --> 03:48.632
...because I'm making fajitas!

03:56.083 --> 03:57.962
I do like fajitas.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.968
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

04:03.130 --> 04:06.524
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

04:06.694 --> 04:10.451
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.177
There's a hair in my coffee.

04:14.181 --> 04:15.536
Hey, guys.

04:15.703 --> 04:18.743
Have you seen Frank Jr?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.899
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets"...

04:21.068 --> 04:23.425
...I think of three hot,
blond 19-year-olds.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.907
That's sweet.

04:26.113 --> 04:27.992
Drink your hair.

04:28.756 --> 04:30.190
Hey, what's all this stuff?

04:30.397 --> 04:32.914
They're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.397
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.316
Get this one.

04:38.085 --> 04:39.759
That's not really how it works.

04:39.967 --> 04:42.609
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

04:43.811 --> 04:46.647
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

04:46.814 --> 04:49.854
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

04:50.017 --> 04:51.611
Thanks, that would be great.

04:51.779 --> 04:53.931
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

04:57.585 --> 05:00.306
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.348
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

05:04.111 --> 05:06.422
That's not what we talked about!

05:06.714 --> 05:09.993
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

05:10.157 --> 05:11.956
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

05:12.119 --> 05:14.476
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

05:14.682 --> 05:18.394
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

05:18.606 --> 05:21.406
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...

05:21.609 --> 05:24.570
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

05:25.172 --> 05:28.691
And that's Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

05:30.217 --> 05:32.973
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.695
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

05:39.587 --> 05:43.219
Can I just say, I know we're doing this
for Ross and that's cool.

05:43.390 --> 05:46.864
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

05:47.074 --> 05:49.112
Well, what would we be doing?

05:49.276 --> 05:51.314
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

05:51.519 --> 05:56.358
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

05:57.484 --> 05:58.885
Feel me up?

05:59.086 --> 06:00.806
In a carriage.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.290
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.171
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.529
So...

06:07.895 --> 06:10.365
...dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

06:11.098 --> 06:13.375
So did you bring
a little something for Ross?

06:13.541 --> 06:17.014
Actually, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

06:17.665 --> 06:19.817
Well, thanks.

06:20.027 --> 06:22.418
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.228
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.

06:29.436 --> 06:31.156
I thought I heard voices.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.034
Hi, Charlie.

06:34.401 --> 06:36.679
Hey, Joey.

06:37.004 --> 06:40.842
And, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

06:43.651 --> 06:46.566
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know...

06:49.056 --> 06:51.174
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

06:51.338 --> 06:53.490
Okay.
Well, we brought you some wine.

06:55.142 --> 06:57.135
That is so thoughtful.

06:57.344 --> 06:59.416
She's a keeper.

07:00.668 --> 07:03.504
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Actually, that's...

07:03.711 --> 07:05.624
Underwear, a toothbrush...

07:05.793 --> 07:07.831
...and a Van Halen CD.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.512
I can use all these things!

07:11.799 --> 07:14.076
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little...

07:14.281 --> 07:16.559
What? Fine? Because I am.

07:16.724 --> 07:18.956
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?
You see?

07:19.126 --> 07:21.164
Who else is fine?

07:21.769 --> 07:23.044
Come on.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.211
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

07:26.373 --> 07:28.172
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

07:28.335 --> 07:30.852
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.863
Oh, God.

07:38.145 --> 07:39.739
So adorable.

07:39.907 --> 07:42.743
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

07:42.910 --> 07:46.509
Yeah, I really cherish
these moments...

07:46.674 --> 07:50.067
...because before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

07:51.358 --> 07:53.430
Well, they may be a handful...

07:53.601 --> 07:55.514
...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.201
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.

07:59.406 --> 08:02.367
I haven't slept in four years.

08:04.131 --> 08:06.283
That's a long time.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.651
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.576
There's just so many of them.

08:10.738 --> 08:12.331
You know, two I could handle.

08:12.499 --> 08:14.936
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

08:15.102 --> 08:18.336
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

08:18.506 --> 08:21.227
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

08:22.109 --> 08:24.261
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.461
Yeah, I know, Frank.

08:25.633 --> 08:28.787
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

08:30.397 --> 08:32.994
Sometimes, I think that...

08:33.601 --> 08:37.598
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

08:39.046 --> 08:40.321
What?

08:40.528 --> 08:42.566
No, no, I can't.

08:44.652 --> 08:47.122
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

08:47.294 --> 08:50.334
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

08:50.538 --> 08:53.692
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

08:54.381 --> 08:58.173
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

08:58.465 --> 09:00.105
What?

09:00.748 --> 09:04.426
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

09:09.236 --> 09:10.717
Thank you so much for seeing us.

09:10.878 --> 09:12.996
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.720
Please, we're happy to help.

09:15.002 --> 09:17.393
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

09:17.565 --> 09:21.528
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

09:27.174 --> 09:29.816
I mean, you have a lovely home.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.170
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.653
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

09:35.863 --> 09:36.853
It's pretty much...

09:37.024 --> 09:39.096
...all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

09:39.266 --> 09:41.988
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.871
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

09:45.072 --> 09:46.108
Thank you.

09:46.473 --> 09:48.512
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.839
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

09:56.003 --> 09:58.964
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.318
That's great. Can I see the book?

10:02.489 --> 10:05.404
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

10:05.653 --> 10:08.534
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

10:09.336 --> 10:11.694
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.379
I would have told him to do it too.

10:14.582 --> 10:16.575
Can I adopt you?

10:18.786 --> 10:20.858
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

10:21.068 --> 10:23.425
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

10:23.631 --> 10:27.104
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

10:28.876 --> 10:30.630
You know how to use a compass?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.273
I have a badge in it.

10:32.479 --> 10:34.598
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

10:34.802 --> 10:37.079
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

10:37.244 --> 10:39.441
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

10:39.607 --> 10:41.166
What?

10:46.734 --> 10:48.453
What?

10:49.296 --> 10:51.733
I'm adopted?

10:52.940 --> 10:54.898
I got nothing.

11:00.347 --> 11:04.504
Well, that first batch of margaritas
was not so great...

11:04.712 --> 11:07.991
...but this second batch is good.

11:09.637 --> 11:12.837
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.272
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.640
You know, just the four of us.

11:17.805 --> 11:19.559
Just hanging.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.607
Dude, are you okay?

11:21.769 --> 11:23.602
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

11:25.092 --> 11:27.973
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

11:28.135 --> 11:30.971
I'm just...
I'm just proud of us.

11:31.138 --> 11:34.451
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

11:34.662 --> 11:36.575
No awareness.

11:37.745 --> 11:40.501
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

11:41.388 --> 11:43.267
Let's take a trip!

11:44.832 --> 11:47.428
Okay, where do you think we can go?

11:47.595 --> 11:49.713
My fajitas!

11:52.359 --> 11:55.354
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

11:55.523 --> 11:59.600
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

11:59.807 --> 12:01.959
You know, he normally
doesn't drink like this.

12:02.169 --> 12:05.289
You know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

12:08.856 --> 12:11.418
I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

12:13.340 --> 12:17.657
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

12:17.865 --> 12:19.778
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.866
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

12:28.756 --> 12:30.190
Okay, well, this is crazy.

12:30.397 --> 12:33.757
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.435
Oh, no, of course we're not.

12:35.603 --> 12:37.196
- That's insane.
- I know.

12:37.364 --> 12:38.765
Alice would never go for it.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.041
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

12:43.611 --> 12:47.847
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

12:48.015 --> 12:50.053
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

12:52.059 --> 12:53.653
Frank Jr. Jr?

12:53.861 --> 12:56.093
You'd be getting a really good one.

12:56.263 --> 12:58.860
I mean, you know,
he's really funny.

12:59.026 --> 13:02.579
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

13:03.150 --> 13:05.951
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

13:07.354 --> 13:09.392
A talking frog.

13:11.478 --> 13:14.599
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny.

13:15.322 --> 13:18.158
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about Leslie?

13:18.365 --> 13:20.403
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

13:20.568 --> 13:24.120
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

13:25.412 --> 13:27.052
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

13:27.254 --> 13:30.329
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

13:30.538 --> 13:31.938
I got big hopes for her.

13:32.099 --> 13:35.698
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

13:38.305 --> 13:41.938
Wow, Frank,
I think we just ran out of kids.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.063
Oh, I think you're right.

13:47.915 --> 13:52.390
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.158
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

13:58.606 --> 14:01.726
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

14:01.889 --> 14:05.009
You know, I'll help out more.
I can babysit anytime you want.

14:05.172 --> 14:06.766
You name the day and I'll be there.

14:06.934 --> 14:09.211
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

14:10.177 --> 14:13.172
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

14:13.340 --> 14:15.458
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

14:15.623 --> 14:17.536
You'd do that for us?

14:17.745 --> 14:19.897
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

14:25.713 --> 14:27.990
Oh, look at them.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.758
I love you so much.

14:32.399 --> 14:35.314
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

14:38.125 --> 14:41.120
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- kitchen, getting something to eat.

14:41.288 --> 14:42.803
Can you believe
how nice they are?

14:42.970 --> 14:44.199
We have to leave.

14:45.733 --> 14:48.569
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

14:48.736 --> 14:51.457
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

14:51.619 --> 14:54.215
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

14:54.381 --> 14:55.702
...I may have told him.

14:56.143 --> 14:59.263
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

14:59.426 --> 15:01.738
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.348
Some little snacks for everybody.

15:04.512 --> 15:07.392
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

15:07.955 --> 15:09.389
I'll go get him in a second.

15:09.597 --> 15:12.797
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.559
But kids are so intuitive.

15:15.723 --> 15:17.955
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

15:18.165 --> 15:21.365
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

15:21.889 --> 15:23.802
What? Where did you hear that?

15:24.011 --> 15:25.081
He told me.

15:26.654 --> 15:30.047
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

15:30.618 --> 15:33.134
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.854
You told him he's adopted?

15:38.025 --> 15:40.622
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

15:40.788 --> 15:43.828
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

15:43.991 --> 15:47.350
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
and he also thinks Santa is real."

15:47.555 --> 15:49.228
He isn't?

15:50.357 --> 15:52.635
We have to get out of here, baby.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.956
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

15:59.166 --> 16:01.922
...to Rachel and Joey.

16:03.891 --> 16:06.772
And to love.

16:09.376 --> 16:10.697
Ah, love!

16:12.700 --> 16:14.897
L-O-V-E. Love.

16:15.062 --> 16:17.100
L is for "life."

16:17.264 --> 16:19.735
And what is life without love?

16:20.708 --> 16:23.224
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

16:24.672 --> 16:27.792
O is for:

16:28.716 --> 16:30.788
"Oh, wow!"

16:33.601 --> 16:37.040
The V is for this...

16:37.204 --> 16:41.042
...very surprising turn of events...

16:41.328 --> 16:44.768
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

16:46.574 --> 16:48.486
E...

16:51.178 --> 16:52.898
...is for how...

16:53.060 --> 16:56.852
...extremely normal I find it...

16:57.024 --> 16:59.062
...that you two...

17:00.187 --> 17:01.462
...are together.

17:03.551 --> 17:06.910
And that one day
you might get married...

17:09.076 --> 17:11.877
...and have children of your own.

17:15.603 --> 17:18.757
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

17:20.728 --> 17:22.048
Ross, you don't seem okay.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.563
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

17:28.976 --> 17:32.449
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

17:32.980 --> 17:36.134
Wait, Ross. Ross, I...
I have to take off.

17:36.343 --> 17:37.983
- No!
- I'm sorry.

17:38.145 --> 17:40.456
I have an early class in the morning.

17:40.628 --> 17:44.226
But this has been lovely.

17:44.792 --> 17:48.835
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

17:48.996 --> 17:51.273
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

17:52.319 --> 17:56.441
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

17:56.604 --> 17:58.197
- Okay.
- All right.

18:01.168 --> 18:03.286
God, Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just...

18:03.490 --> 18:05.768
That's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.287
Fine.

18:10.417 --> 18:13.970
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

18:15.823 --> 18:17.816
Hey, that rhymes.

18:19.987 --> 18:23.027
You know what, Ross,
I think we're gonna take off too.

18:24.672 --> 18:27.872
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

18:28.035 --> 18:29.516
You guys are a couple now.

18:29.677 --> 18:32.034
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

18:32.239 --> 18:35.713
- No, it's just getting late...
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

18:35.883 --> 18:38.719
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

18:44.932 --> 18:47.368
I don't even know what that's for.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.174
You know what?

18:54.461 --> 18:57.376
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

18:57.585 --> 19:00.580
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.182
Okay.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.387
Yeah, you know, Joey, I...

19:04.552 --> 19:07.911
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

19:08.115 --> 19:10.233
It doesn't look good, does it?

19:29.416 --> 19:30.817
Morning.

19:31.018 --> 19:33.535
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

19:33.901 --> 19:37.499
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

19:38.906 --> 19:41.981
So you took off my pants and shoes?

19:42.189 --> 19:43.704
No. No, no.

19:43.871 --> 19:47.834
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.

19:49.797 --> 19:52.872
Look, Ross...

19:53.040 --> 19:56.353
...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

19:56.524 --> 19:58.721
...because nothing's gonna happen.

19:58.926 --> 20:01.158
What do you mean?

20:01.649 --> 20:03.288
She and I said from the beginning...

20:03.450 --> 20:06.251
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.848
And clearly...

20:08.055 --> 20:10.652
What are you talking about?
I'm fine.

20:10.858 --> 20:14.456
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

20:14.622 --> 20:17.263
Of course you're not fine. You're...

20:19.066 --> 20:20.945
You're Ross and Rachel.

20:22.710 --> 20:24.907
Yeah, except we're not.

20:25.673 --> 20:29.032
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

20:30.918 --> 20:33.115
...six years.

20:34.562 --> 20:37.158
My God, is that right?

20:37.965 --> 20:39.319
Has it been that long?

20:40.167 --> 20:42.444
That's what I hear, yeah.

20:43.891 --> 20:47.524
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

20:47.695 --> 20:50.849
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

20:52.259 --> 20:54.058
Can I ask you something?

20:54.221 --> 20:55.622
Really...

20:56.504 --> 20:58.940
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?

21:00.868 --> 21:04.501
Come on, you know me.
You know...

21:05.833 --> 21:06.823
Joey.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.278
I'm crazy about her.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.843
And she feels the same way?

21:24.732 --> 21:26.725
I think so.

21:29.056 --> 21:30.650
Well, then...

21:30.818 --> 21:33.095
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

21:33.621 --> 21:36.091
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so...

21:36.303 --> 21:39.457
No, but I want to be.

21:41.188 --> 21:42.942
I will be.

21:45.753 --> 21:48.394
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

21:48.556 --> 21:50.947
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?

21:51.118 --> 21:53.715
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

21:54.762 --> 21:58.360
No, that was...
That was just for me.

22:01.809 --> 22:03.529
Hey, you...?

22:03.691 --> 22:05.524
You sure about this?

22:05.733 --> 22:08.295
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.773
And...

22:12.700 --> 22:14.613
...we're okay?

22:25.833 --> 22:27.392
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.148
We just want to give
you a heads up.

22:29.316 --> 22:31.309
Bill and Colleen hate us.

22:31.519 --> 22:33.796
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.315
What?

22:35.523 --> 22:37.321
Still, he had to find out sometime.

22:37.484 --> 22:41.481
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

22:45.653 --> 22:48.123
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.

22:52.780 --> 22:53.770
