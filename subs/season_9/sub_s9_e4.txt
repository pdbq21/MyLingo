00:01.570 --> 00:02.697
Hey, Ross.

00:02.872 --> 00:06.539
I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?

00:09.284 --> 00:10.719
- Sure.
- Thank you.

00:10.888 --> 00:13.519
Can you believe no one
between my apartment and here..

00:13.694 --> 00:15.857
offered to do that for me?

00:16.032 --> 00:17.558
People.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.431
So why are you so dressed up?

00:21.610 --> 00:23.807
Mike's picking me up for a date.

00:23.981 --> 00:26.953
How's that going?
Is it getting serious?

00:27.120 --> 00:30.582
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, I like him.

00:30.761 --> 00:34.097
But am I ready to take
my Grade A loins off the meat market?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.397
I'm not quite sure.

00:37.942 --> 00:41.939
You know, I really admire
your whole dating attitude.

00:42.117 --> 00:45.248
It's so healthy. I'm always like,
"Is this moving too fast?

00:45.423 --> 00:47.986
Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"

00:48.162 --> 00:51.157
I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.

00:51.937 --> 00:56.207
You're so much better off. You just
go from guy to guy having fun..

00:56.378 --> 01:00.683
and not worrying that it
never turns into anything serious.

01:00.855 --> 01:03.052
I wouldn't say "never."

01:03.259 --> 01:05.526
You know, there is that guy.

01:06.298 --> 01:08.268
Okay, well, what about..?

01:08.937 --> 01:11.499
Okay, there's gotta be someone.

01:11.676 --> 01:16.413
- There isn't! That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, my God, you're right!

01:16.586 --> 01:20.218
I know. And yet, here you are,
all ready for the next date.

01:21.563 --> 01:24.466
I can't believe I never
realized this before.

01:24.636 --> 01:28.906
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been
in a long-term relationship.

01:29.077 --> 01:31.878
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

01:35.791 --> 01:37.556
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:37.728 --> 01:43.069
I mean, you don't strike me as the type
of person that wants to get married.

01:43.239 --> 01:45.608
I want to get married!

01:45.778 --> 01:48.180
No, please..
Please don't cry because of me.

01:48.382 --> 01:53.256
I don't know what I'm talking about,
okay? I've been divorced three times.

01:53.426 --> 01:55.089
At least you've been married.

01:55.263 --> 01:58.703
Oh, my God!
I want to trade lives with Ross?!

02:01.676 --> 02:03.646
Phoebe.

02:03.947 --> 02:06.783
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

02:08.356 --> 02:13.025
Mike, this is Ross Geller.
Ross, this is Mike..

02:15.036 --> 02:17.199
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
- Mike Hanigan.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.139
- Ross Geller.
- Hey.

02:19.545 --> 02:22.482
So are you sure you're ready to go?

02:23.520 --> 02:25.250
How do I look?

02:26.960 --> 02:30.364
- Do you have a compact in your purse?
- No.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.468
You look great.

03:23.472 --> 03:26.308
- Hey, Joey.
- This girl won't turn around.

03:26.478 --> 03:30.009
I can't tell if she's hot or not.
What do you think?

03:30.186 --> 03:34.286
Joey, I am not going
to objectify women with you.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.828
But if her face is
as nice as her ass..

03:37.000 --> 03:39.197
- Mama!
- All right. Thanks.

03:39.371 --> 03:43.004
- Have you talked to Chandler?
- He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.582
- How come?
- I don't know. He has to work.

03:45.751 --> 03:48.655
There's some big rush on the..

03:51.729 --> 03:56.865
Damn it. I'm gonna have to start
listening when he talks about his job.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.133
Why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?

03:59.311 --> 04:01.338
I'd love to. I really miss him.

04:01.516 --> 04:04.579
But I can't. I have one day off
and it's just too expensive.

04:04.755 --> 04:08.957
Interesting. So Chandler's not worth
the price of a plane ticket to you.

04:10.366 --> 04:12.393
Of course he is.

04:13.272 --> 04:15.641
Maybe I will go.

04:17.080 --> 04:21.077
We'll have a little second honeymoon
at the Tulsa Ramada.

04:21.255 --> 04:26.824
You should bring your black see-through
teddy with the attached garters.

04:29.805 --> 04:33.939
- How do you know I have one of those?
- Didn't until just now.

04:36.285 --> 04:38.552
Hot. Not hot.

04:39.692 --> 04:41.285
Hot!

04:41.996 --> 04:43.123
Excuse me?

04:46.471 --> 04:49.068
I said that I think you're hot.

04:49.277 --> 04:52.340
And.. now I'm embarrassed.

04:52.785 --> 04:54.880
I thought you said "hi."

04:55.591 --> 04:57.652
That would've been better.

04:57.828 --> 05:01.028
I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.430
I'm Hayley.

05:03.439 --> 05:08.712
Look, I don't normally ask out women
that I meet in coffeehouses.

05:12.323 --> 05:13.883
Gesundheit.

05:19.104 --> 05:20.767
But..

05:21.676 --> 05:24.671
This is hard. I'm kind of shy.

05:28.122 --> 05:30.456
Seriously, you should see someone
about that cold.

05:30.627 --> 05:32.654
If it gets much worse, you could die.

05:36.138 --> 05:39.406
- Anyway..
- I would love to go out with you.

05:39.912 --> 05:42.850
Really? Great.

05:43.018 --> 05:45.717
Did I..?
Did I actually ask you?

05:45.891 --> 05:49.159
That's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.

05:49.330 --> 05:54.068
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who does this a lot?

05:57.815 --> 06:00.115
Damn it, Gunther, you gave it to me.

06:05.764 --> 06:07.631
Oh, it's you.

06:07.801 --> 06:11.331
With vegetarian corndogs.

06:12.745 --> 06:14.441
Come on, I just want to talk to you.

06:14.615 --> 06:17.211
About what? How few ova I have left?

06:18.188 --> 06:21.559
Come on, I just wanna apologize
for what happened yesterday.

06:22.463 --> 06:24.433
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

06:25.771 --> 06:28.173
That's okay, Ross.

06:32.483 --> 06:35.216
- So how'd the date go?
- Well, it was awful.

06:35.389 --> 06:36.983
I barely got through dinner.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.757
Every time I thought about
what you said, I cried.

06:40.266 --> 06:45.299
I'm pretty sure he spent most of the night
just staring at me in horror.

06:45.476 --> 06:49.542
But I couldn't know for sure
because my eyes were swollen shut.

06:50.787 --> 06:53.189
You know I wasn't trying
to make you cry.

06:53.358 --> 06:55.989
I was really trying to say something nice.

06:56.164 --> 07:00.161
I was basically saying even though
you've never been in a serious relationship..

07:00.339 --> 07:03.209
- Are we gonna do this again?
- Sorry.

07:03.478 --> 07:06.348
- So he hasn't called?
- Would you call this girl:

07:06.519 --> 07:09.719
"Thanks for.. a lovely.. evening"?

07:10.794 --> 07:13.264
Now I feel terrible.
This is all my fault.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.960
You know what you should
feel terrible about?

07:16.137 --> 07:18.300
This could have been my serious guy.

07:18.475 --> 07:20.969
He was sweet and smart and funny.

07:21.147 --> 07:23.516
You know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?

07:23.987 --> 07:26.082
We are a rare breed.

07:30.299 --> 07:32.132
Hey, maybe that's him.

07:34.374 --> 07:35.638
Hello?

07:35.810 --> 07:37.369
Could you hold on one sec?

07:37.547 --> 07:40.211
- I need some privacy.
- Is it Mike?

07:40.386 --> 07:44.224
No, it's a heavy breather.
I'll take what I can get.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.758
I'm listening.

07:51.943 --> 07:53.640
What a great dinner.

07:53.813 --> 07:57.981
Thanks again for letting me have that
last piece of cake at the restaurant.

07:58.990 --> 08:02.360
You're welcome again.
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

08:02.531 --> 08:05.093
- Can I get you anything?
- Do you have any cake?

08:11.314 --> 08:13.477
So this is going pretty good.

08:13.653 --> 08:16.887
Dinner was nice.
We've got a lot in common.

08:17.059 --> 08:19.120
Victoria 's Secret.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.062
We even like the same books.

08:24.541 --> 08:26.100
There's a scary painting.

08:27.013 --> 08:28.379
Wait a minute.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.215
I think I've been scared
by that painting before.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.155
You know what?
This whole place looks familiar.

08:36.331 --> 08:38.426
I have definitely been
in this apartment.

08:38.603 --> 08:41.369
I know I've seen
this weird plant before.

08:42.309 --> 08:44.906
It did that the last time!

08:45.082 --> 08:48.054
Oh, my God.
I've gone out with this girl before.

08:48.221 --> 08:50.590
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

08:50.794 --> 08:53.492
And then on that chair, and..
No.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.533
No, we didn't do it here..

08:55.703 --> 08:59.575
which is weird, because it seems
like a perfectly good place.

08:59.745 --> 09:01.338
That's why.

09:09.397 --> 09:13.771
Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by
like this. Can I come in?

09:13.940 --> 09:15.408
Sure.

09:15.977 --> 09:17.708
Who are you?

09:18.215 --> 09:21.210
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend
from the coffeehouse?

09:21.387 --> 09:25.157
I really, really need to talk
to you about something.

09:25.362 --> 09:26.558
Unless..

09:26.732 --> 09:31.070
You're not gonna try
and get me to join a cult, are you?

09:32.443 --> 09:35.883
No, it's just, you know,
you have that look.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.116
Damn Supercuts!

09:41.194 --> 09:44.634
- Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:44.801 --> 09:48.035
Phoebe is great. But..

09:48.208 --> 09:50.201
I'm an idiot, okay?

09:50.412 --> 09:52.473
Right before you guys went out..

09:55.355 --> 09:59.125
I accidentally got her all upset.

10:00.098 --> 10:01.498
That's why she was weird.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.901
Yes. Yeah, I..

10:06.311 --> 10:11.344
Yeah, I said something stupid about her
never having had a serious relationship.

10:11.522 --> 10:15.587
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.

10:15.763 --> 10:19.931
- Please, don't blow her off.
- I'm not gonna blow her off.

10:20.105 --> 10:23.043
I just spoke to her.
We're going out tomorrow night.

10:23.211 --> 10:28.313
I mean, I hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.

10:31.127 --> 10:35.067
That's great. So the crying
didn't turn you off?

10:35.937 --> 10:39.171
I just got out of a nine-year relationship
with a manic-depressive.

10:39.343 --> 10:41.837
Compared to that,
Phoebe's a Mousketeer.

10:42.383 --> 10:45.219
Well, then, I didn't need
to bother you.

10:45.389 --> 10:49.489
You or the four other
Mike Hanigans I bothered.

10:50.566 --> 10:55.634
One of whom was quite large
and a little flirty.

11:00.385 --> 11:04.120
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Is that true what you said?

11:04.293 --> 11:07.664
Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.100
Of course she has.

11:10.339 --> 11:12.833
If she's never had
a serious relationship..

11:13.011 --> 11:15.277
do you think I'd go
around broadcasting it..

11:15.449 --> 11:19.857
like some kind
of unstoppable moron?

11:21.060 --> 11:25.194
- But you did say it.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

11:26.572 --> 11:29.042
And I will also say..

11:29.210 --> 11:31.841
what I'm about to say..

11:32.449 --> 11:34.545
vis-a-vis..

11:34.721 --> 11:36.884
the following.

11:38.428 --> 11:43.872
Phoebe has never had
a serious relationship..

11:44.306 --> 11:45.798
since..

11:45.977 --> 11:50.681
her super-serious relationship..

11:50.887 --> 11:52.116
with..

11:52.289 --> 11:53.815
Vikram.

11:55.295 --> 11:58.131
- Vikram?
- What? That's a real name.

12:07.319 --> 12:09.016
Stop it!

12:09.190 --> 12:12.128
Why couldn't they have
sent me to Texas?

12:13.031 --> 12:15.058
Seven o'clock.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.430
Maybe I'll hit the gym.

12:23.218 --> 12:26.384
Who am I kidding?
Pay-per-view porn.

12:40.485 --> 12:43.355
- Do not disturb! Do not disturb!
- Surprise!

12:45.563 --> 12:48.227
- Monica?
- Is everything all right?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.303
Yeah, everything's great.
I was just..

12:50.506 --> 12:53.409
watching some
regular television there.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.780
What a pleasant surprise.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.637
- I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
- Okay, honey.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.682
That was close.

13:26.043 --> 13:28.377
- Hello.
- Hey, Rach, it's me.

13:28.549 --> 13:32.853
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,
and I caught him..

13:33.024 --> 13:35.051
molesting himself.

13:36.765 --> 13:38.860
That couldn't have been pretty.

13:39.036 --> 13:41.131
But you know, guys do that.

13:41.307 --> 13:42.799
Well, the weird part is..

13:42.977 --> 13:46.438
he was getting off..
to a shark-attack show!

13:46.918 --> 13:51.553
- No!
- Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

13:59.009 --> 14:01.070
- While watching sharks?
- Yeah.

14:01.247 --> 14:03.582
Are you sure that's what
he was doing?

14:03.752 --> 14:06.656
You know how many times
I've seen him jump up like that?

14:06.825 --> 14:08.818
Believe me, I know what he was doing.

14:09.931 --> 14:12.401
Man! Sharks!

14:12.570 --> 14:15.940
I always knew there was something
weird about that dude.

14:16.645 --> 14:18.443
You promised to love him
no matter what.

14:18.615 --> 14:22.783
"What" means, like, if he
gets a disease or kills someone.

14:23.291 --> 14:26.958
Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.231
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.

14:30.405 --> 14:33.002
They like things
that we can't understand.

14:33.177 --> 14:35.512
I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend..

14:35.683 --> 14:38.849
that he was an archeologist,
and I was this..

14:39.022 --> 14:44.021
naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.506
Are you talking about my brother?

14:47.673 --> 14:49.836
I didn't disguise that very well, did I?

14:52.750 --> 14:53.809
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:53.986 --> 14:58.086
I went out with this girl last night.
Halfway through our date I realized..

14:58.261 --> 14:59.890
I already slept with her.

15:01.868 --> 15:06.332
You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,
and now you're going around again?

15:06.511 --> 15:08.002
That's not even the weird part.

15:08.181 --> 15:12.349
- She didn't remember sleeping with me!
- You don't remember sleeping with her.

15:12.523 --> 15:16.189
But she should remember sleeping
with me. I am very memorable!

15:17.399 --> 15:19.301
- You guys know.
- How do we know?

15:19.469 --> 15:22.704
- We've never slept with you.
- And whose fault is that?

15:24.046 --> 15:26.380
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.454
- Maybe you were having an off night.
- Hey!

15:32.395 --> 15:34.992
I never have an off night. Okay?

15:35.168 --> 15:38.539
Although, sometimes if I'm
a little bloated, I don't feel that sexy.

15:38.709 --> 15:41.475
But even then, I'm better than most!

15:42.315 --> 15:45.412
Honey, why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?

15:45.589 --> 15:48.561
You're both so slutty, you don't
remember who you slept with.

15:48.729 --> 15:50.322
You're made for each other.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.104
Interesting.

15:55.408 --> 15:58.779
Well, I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.

15:58.949 --> 16:01.614
No salt! Bloaty!

16:01.821 --> 16:03.255
- Joey?
- What?

16:03.424 --> 16:05.485
You don't think
sharks are sexy, do you?

16:05.663 --> 16:07.256
No.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.435
Wait a minute.
Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?

16:14.279 --> 16:16.374
It's open!

16:16.918 --> 16:21.382
- Hey.
- Mike called! We're going out again!

16:24.499 --> 16:26.902
Quick thing.
I went to talk to Mike.

16:27.072 --> 16:28.404
What?

16:28.642 --> 16:31.010
What did you..?
What did you do, Ross?

16:31.180 --> 16:34.243
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

16:34.921 --> 16:37.825
I went over there, you know,
to tell him how..

16:37.994 --> 16:41.593
How great you are. But..

16:41.768 --> 16:44.466
Well, you know me.
Blah-blah-blah.

16:46.811 --> 16:50.512
- And I ended up telling him that..
- What?

16:51.654 --> 16:54.785
You had a six-year-long relationship..

16:54.961 --> 16:57.056
with a guy named Vikram.

16:58.735 --> 17:00.728
What? Why?

17:00.906 --> 17:03.571
Well, he seemed..

17:03.745 --> 17:09.690
to bum hard when I told him you'd
never been in a serious relationship.

17:13.030 --> 17:15.866
If you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend..

17:16.036 --> 17:19.406
I swear to Lucifer..

17:19.577 --> 17:24.576
a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now!

17:25.254 --> 17:28.192
I think you'll feel differently
when you know..

17:28.360 --> 17:30.695
a little bit about Vikram.

17:31.266 --> 17:33.259
Okay, he's a..

17:33.437 --> 17:36.604
He's a kite designer.

17:38.548 --> 17:41.782
And he used to date Oprah.

17:43.457 --> 17:47.295
I'm not going along
with some lie you made up, Ross.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.868
- I'm just gonna be honest with him.
- Good.

17:50.037 --> 17:51.768
Just be honest with him.

17:51.941 --> 17:54.036
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
- No.

17:54.212 --> 17:58.677
So I haven't been in a relationship
that lasted longer than a month.

17:58.855 --> 18:01.325
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.

18:01.493 --> 18:06.094
If he can't handle it,
then he can leave. Which he will.

18:06.270 --> 18:09.903
And, you know, that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.

18:10.077 --> 18:12.844
You know, all right.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

18:13.017 --> 18:16.616
I'll go on walking tours
with widows and lesbians.

18:19.062 --> 18:20.998
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

18:23.872 --> 18:28.006
I'm trying to remember the last time
I opened a door and you weren't there.

18:31.119 --> 18:33.784
Phoebe, are you okay?

18:35.629 --> 18:38.829
Yeah. There's just..

18:39.737 --> 18:42.333
There's something you should know.

18:44.412 --> 18:47.407
Vikram just called.

18:48.755 --> 18:51.659
So it was really a shock
after 25 years of marriage..

18:51.828 --> 18:54.766
my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest..

18:54.934 --> 18:57.701
- because I was the youngest.
- Sure. Yeah.

18:57.873 --> 19:00.139
How can you not remember me?

19:00.879 --> 19:01.904
What?

19:02.115 --> 19:04.051
How could you not remember
that we slept together?

19:04.219 --> 19:07.214
- What? When?
- I don't know!

19:07.826 --> 19:11.094
I really, really think
I would remember sleeping with you.

19:11.266 --> 19:14.706
Come on, come on.
Search your brain, all right? It was..

19:14.874 --> 19:18.507
a certain amount of time ago.
I was here. You were here.

19:18.682 --> 19:21.118
We had sex here, here, here..

19:21.286 --> 19:23.222
Not there.

19:23.390 --> 19:26.522
- Anything?
- No, it's not ringing any bells.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.861
My God, woman!

19:29.035 --> 19:31.905
How many people have you been with
not to remember this?

19:32.075 --> 19:35.206
Hey, Hayley.
We really gotta fix that doorknob.

19:36.951 --> 19:38.078
Joey?

19:42.696 --> 19:44.723
I slept with you!

19:46.470 --> 19:50.308
And you obviously remember me!
Hey, I still got it!

19:50.478 --> 19:52.711
So we're good.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.480
I'll let myself out.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.263
And I said, "Okay, Vikram..

20:00.431 --> 20:03.871
you can't just call
every time you get lonely.

20:04.038 --> 20:07.499
You gave up that right
when you slept with Rachel."

20:08.681 --> 20:11.049
Rachel? I thought she just
had a baby with Ross.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.189
Yeah, well..

20:13.357 --> 20:15.190
Yeah.

20:15.529 --> 20:18.626
But Emma's birth certificate
might say "Geller"..

20:18.802 --> 20:21.774
but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

20:23.010 --> 20:26.916
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

20:27.084 --> 20:30.022
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.

20:30.191 --> 20:35.498
You know, that bastard is one
smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

20:37.104 --> 20:40.440
If you want, I'll mess him up for you.

20:42.381 --> 20:43.748
You would do that?

20:43.918 --> 20:47.482
Unless he's big.
If he's really big, I'll send him..

20:47.659 --> 20:49.150
a rude letter.

20:50.665 --> 20:53.796
I think there's somebody
better out there for you.

20:54.472 --> 20:58.173
I mean, you know, I'm..
I'm not saying me, but..

20:59.182 --> 21:01.551
Maybe.. me.

21:04.192 --> 21:07.096
And you don't have to worry about
glue-sniffing with me.

21:07.265 --> 21:10.465
Although, I do smell
the occasional Magic Marker.

21:12.208 --> 21:15.078
Yeah. Anyway, I just..

21:15.549 --> 21:17.815
I think I can make you happy.

21:21.527 --> 21:23.963
- Okay, I can't do this.
- What's wrong?

21:24.132 --> 21:28.163
Well, there is no Vikram.
Ross made him up.

21:28.340 --> 21:29.809
Because I..

21:29.977 --> 21:32.881
I really never have been
in a long-term relationship.

21:33.050 --> 21:37.583
I've never lived with a guy. I've never
even celebrated an anniversary.

21:37.759 --> 21:39.558
So..

21:40.865 --> 21:43.769
If that's too weird for you..

21:43.972 --> 21:46.101
and you want to leave,
I understand.

21:46.276 --> 21:49.716
In fact, I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.

21:57.131 --> 21:59.260
You kissed me.

22:01.941 --> 22:05.175
- You don't think I'm a total freak?
- No.

22:05.347 --> 22:07.010
Well..

22:07.786 --> 22:09.254
Look, can I..?

22:09.422 --> 22:12.520
Can I think you're a little weird
and also cool..

22:12.696 --> 22:15.166
for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.669
I guess so.

22:17.839 --> 22:20.309
Can I think it's cool
that you kissed me..

22:20.477 --> 22:22.971
and also want to kiss you again?

22:24.620 --> 22:28.822
And be a little concerned
about the Magic Markers?

22:29.028 --> 22:30.964
Definitely.

22:37.478 --> 22:39.881
This is Vikram.

22:43.223 --> 22:47.756
I need to talk to you about
the long-term relationship we had.

22:47.933 --> 22:51.873
Call me. I am in my kite-making studio.

22:56.650 --> 22:59.120
Hi, honey, I'm home.

22:59.823 --> 23:01.086
Hi.

23:01.259 --> 23:03.958
- How was your flight?
- It was great.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.104
I ordered a pool float from the Sky Mall.

23:09.442 --> 23:11.309
Why'd I do that?

23:12.682 --> 23:14.549
Why don't you sit down.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.188
Get yourself comfortable.

23:16.356 --> 23:19.021
Because I have a little..

23:19.195 --> 23:21.427
surprise for you.

23:22.536 --> 23:25.166
Well, well, well.
It must be 5:00 in Tulsa..

23:25.340 --> 23:29.178
because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!

23:30.919 --> 23:35.257
Okay.
This is how much I love you.

23:36.296 --> 23:38.425
The great white..

23:44.111 --> 23:45.705
Honey?

23:45.915 --> 23:49.319
Why am I watching
a bunch of sharks swimming around?

23:50.490 --> 23:52.483
Is this..?
Is this not the good part?

23:52.963 --> 23:57.404
Do you want me to fast-forward
to something.. toothier?

23:57.873 --> 24:01.870
No, I'm just not sure that you
got the right movie, that's all.

24:03.016 --> 24:05.579
This is the only one
they had at our video store.

24:05.788 --> 24:08.885
Though they did have something
called Crocodile Killers.

24:09.061 --> 24:11.862
Or does it always have to be sharks?

24:14.005 --> 24:16.032
Does what always have to be sharks?

24:16.209 --> 24:18.406
Look, we can do something else.

24:18.581 --> 24:22.715
Do you want me to
get into the tub and.. thrash?

24:24.526 --> 24:28.090
- What's going on?
- It's okay. It's okay.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.895
I still love you.

24:30.070 --> 24:34.033
- Let me be a part of this.
- Let me be a part of this!

24:35.447 --> 24:37.645
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.585
Angry sharks turn you on!

24:41.961 --> 24:43.555
No, they don't.

24:44.131 --> 24:48.367
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?

24:48.941 --> 24:52.243
Oh, my God! When you came in,
I switched the channel.

24:52.414 --> 24:55.011
I was just watching regular porn.

24:56.189 --> 24:57.316
Really?

24:57.491 --> 25:01.796
Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,
American, girl-on-girl action.

25:03.804 --> 25:07.004
Can I tell you how happy
that makes me?

25:08.514 --> 25:11.485
You are an amazing wife.

25:11.653 --> 25:15.023
Really, you are amazing. You were
actually gonna do this for me?

25:15.193 --> 25:19.497
Where do you find the strength
and the understanding for that?

25:20.738 --> 25:23.539
I'm very, very drunk right now.

25:30.390 --> 25:33.693
Ordinarily, I would talk to her,
but my confidence is shaken.

25:33.864 --> 25:36.391
Did I sleep with her?
Did I not sleep with her?

25:37.371 --> 25:42.040
Maybe this is a wake-up call. You know,
about your whole dating attitude.

25:42.214 --> 25:47.213
You're in your 30s and you have
never been in a long-term relationship.

25:47.592 --> 25:49.493
Here you go from woman to woman..

25:49.663 --> 25:52.065
meaningless experience
to meaningless experience.

25:52.234 --> 25:55.867
Never even worrying that it doesn't
turn into something more serious.

25:56.042 --> 25:59.173
You're right. I love my life!

26:03.256 --> 26:05.727
I actually did sleep with her.
