WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:06.900
I cannot believe that you didn't
tell me we are still married!

00:07.074 --> 00:08.871
Look, I was going to tell you.

00:09.042 --> 00:11.602
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

00:13.247 --> 00:16.148
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married!

00:16.316 --> 00:18.409
-You're kidding.
-Oh, my God!

00:21.388 --> 00:25.722
It wasn't my best decision, but I
couldn't face another failed marriage.

00:25.893 --> 00:29.693
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

00:32.199 --> 00:36.795
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.306
Maybe it's best not to think about it.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.604
This is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.512
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.314
Another lie. You have a sickness!

00:58.759 --> 01:02.195
For my own peace of mind,
are you married to any more of us?

01:04.097 --> 01:06.361
Look, Rach, I was going to tell you.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.093
I just wanted to do it in my own way.

01:09.269 --> 01:12.170
Yes, silently, with no words.

01:17.244 --> 01:21.237
Look, in Ross' defense, okay....

01:29.156 --> 01:31.056
The One With Joey's Porsche

02:05.459 --> 02:07.188
Someone left their keys.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.188
To a Porsche.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.760
-Are these yours?
-Yeah. That's what I drive.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.829
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.574
Did anybody lose their keys?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.510
Put them in the lost and found.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.445
There's a lost and found?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.414
My shoe!

02:34.755 --> 02:36.586
You left a shoe here?

02:36.757 --> 02:41.524
I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.992
I'll go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.533
When he comes back for his keys,
I'll give him your shoe.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.692
Great. Thanks.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.869
Oh, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

02:56.043 --> 03:00.377
How would you like to spend tomorrow
taking care of three cute puppies?

03:00.547 --> 03:02.811
My God! What a fun day!
Sounds great!

03:02.983 --> 03:04.644
Yeah, all right.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.283
I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.720
By the way, they're not
actually puppies.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.587
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
See you.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.055
What?

03:16.329 --> 03:19.321
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...

03:19.499 --> 03:23.026
asked me to baby-sit them.
I'm nervous. I've never done that.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.864
Don't worry. We'll do it.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.997
I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

03:30.243 --> 03:33.906
Come on, Chandler. It'll give us
great practice for when...

03:34.081 --> 03:36.345
people with babies come to visit.

03:45.425 --> 03:49.122
So I still have boxes here.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.030
I still have boxes at Ross'.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.167
And I have nowhere to live.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.894
I could so easily freak out right now.

03:57.871 --> 04:02.706
What about me? Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.614
Well, maybe I could be
your roommate, Phoebe.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.115
Maybe you could be my roommate!

04:13.687 --> 04:16.281
Well, there's an idea!

04:16.456 --> 04:17.787
That would be great!

04:17.958 --> 04:22.224
-How long is Denise gone for?
-She said she'd be back December 26th.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.124
December 26th.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.594
Maybe she's Santa Claus.

04:31.705 --> 04:36.665
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.370
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2...

04:40.547 --> 04:42.913
and I picked up all the forms.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.482
I'll take care of it.

04:44.651 --> 04:49.315
Sure, if you say you'll take care
of it, I have no reason to doubt you.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.319
Give me those forms.

04:51.491 --> 04:55.325
I'm gonna do this my way and I
don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.986
-Okay, Rach, but..
-You're peeping!

05:02.736 --> 05:04.294
Ross, I just got..

05:04.604 --> 05:06.936
-Why did you do this?
-I told you..

05:07.107 --> 05:09.837
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages."

05:10.010 --> 05:12.808
If you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.209
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

05:18.685 --> 05:23.122
Oh, I am so mad, Ross! I don't think
I've ever been this angry!

05:24.591 --> 05:26.855
What about when I said
we were on a break?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.483
-Nice car.
-Yeah, it's not mine.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.722
-I love your car.
-Yeah, it's mine.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.653
-I bet it's fast.
-Me too. Yeah.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.924
And comfortable.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.000
-You like leather seats?
-Yeah.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.739
It's got them!

06:18.111 --> 06:19.544
Phoebe, how's it going?

06:19.713 --> 06:22.841
I'm okay. Are they having fun?
Am I talking too fast?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.381
No. You sound like me.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.851
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

06:29.456 --> 06:33.984
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.

06:39.866 --> 06:44.394
Phoebe, when you're done over there,
we've got a situation over here too.

06:45.372 --> 06:48.364
No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.942
That's where you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.740
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.042
What do you mean?

06:57.217 --> 07:01.517
Things'll go smoother if we each have a
zone. Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.619
Mon, be in charge of diapering.

07:04.791 --> 07:09.251
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute
they are when they put their hands...

07:10.997 --> 07:13.795
Sounds great, but you should be
in charge of wiping.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.902
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

07:27.013 --> 07:31.950
This is so great. This is exactly how
we set the plates at the restaurant.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.950
Yeah? Well, this is not
what I ordered.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.550
Hey, guys.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.716
Hey, babies.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.929
I'm having the best morning.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.658
That Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.361
Shocking, since you
still have the keys.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.498
You should see the treatment I get
with that car.

07:55.675 --> 07:59.202
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.540
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.841
What equity investments?

08:03.016 --> 08:06.144
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

08:10.023 --> 08:14.687
If people see me just standing there,
they're gonna think I don't own it.

08:14.861 --> 08:18.353
So I figure I'll wash it.
Monica, you got a bucket and soap?

08:18.531 --> 08:21.796
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags...

08:21.968 --> 08:25.927
and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.997
You don't even have a car.

08:28.308 --> 08:32.836
I know. Once there was a dirty car in
front of the building, so I washed it.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.743
-And?
-And six others.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.076
There you are.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.315
Yeah, she tops out at 130.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.625
That's just in the city.
I get her up to 160 upstate.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.263
Really? You got a place upstate?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.031
Sure.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.635
-All right. See you later.
-Okay. Take it easy.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.003
Hey. That's my car.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.940
Really?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.209
Just give me five more minutes.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.244
What are you doing?

09:09.416 --> 09:12.613
I found the keys and now
I'm just polishing her up.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.346
-But it's my car.
-Yeah, but it's my wax.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.589
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.457
I don't know if you're crazy or
if this is some street theater...

09:24.631 --> 09:27.065
but could I have my keys?

09:27.233 --> 09:30.396
Sure. Yeah.
I'll save your parking spot.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.264
I'm not coming back.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.407
-Why not?
-I live upstate.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.535
Yeah, so did I.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.039
I don't know why I was so nervous...

09:41.214 --> 09:44.274
and why Frank and Alice complain.
This is easy.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.318
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.920
Check it out!
When the babies wake up...

09:52.092 --> 09:53.992
they can meet Krog!

09:56.396 --> 09:58.830
That thing could put
someone's eye out.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.331
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.894
They could swallow
one of those little parts.

10:06.072 --> 10:09.838
Also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.939
It's just not an appropriate toy
for 1-year-olds. Or 30-year-olds.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.016
They won't swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.984
When I was a kid, my mom used to throw
me into a pile of broken glass.

10:22.822 --> 10:26.189
-What?
-Glass, sand, whatever.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.721
Look at little Leslie stretching
in her sleep.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.228
Oh, it's so cute.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.424
I wonder when you stop putting
both legs behind your head.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.830
I can still do that.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.938
How are you still single?

10:42.775 --> 10:47.474
I thought about it and maybe you're
right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.549
-What made you change your mind?
-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.285
How did that happen?

10:54.687 --> 10:56.814
I was trying to prove
that I was right.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.449
And it turns out I was wrong...

10:59.626 --> 11:01.821
and now it's lodged in my throat.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.201
This whole time we were
concentrating on the babies...

11:09.369 --> 11:12.065
and no one was watching Chandler!

11:15.108 --> 11:17.599
You are asking the court
for an annulment?

11:17.777 --> 11:20.712
Yes, Your Honor. Here are
our forms, all filled out.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.110
So based on your petition...

11:23.283 --> 11:25.979
you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds...

11:26.152 --> 11:28.916
that "Mr. Geller
is mentally unstable."

11:31.991 --> 11:34.721
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

11:35.328 --> 11:39.094
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user."

11:40.233 --> 11:43.566
-What?
-Yes. Heroin and crack.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.996
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.732
Well, you would know.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.135
Now, it also says here that you...

11:54.314 --> 11:57.249
"lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."

11:57.417 --> 11:58.406
Oh, come on.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.019
Ross, please. I found the magazines.

12:02.822 --> 12:06.417
And finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."

12:06.593 --> 12:10.427
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.490
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.535
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay and there is no problem...

12:18.705 --> 12:21.435
with my ability
to consummate anything.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.771
I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now!

12:26.012 --> 12:28.310
That won't be necessary.

12:28.715 --> 12:32.082
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

12:32.986 --> 12:37.355
If you were involved in a serious
relationship, that creates a problem.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.890
Rest assured, that relationship
ended two years ago.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.223
Strike "consummated like bunnies"
from the record.

12:45.064 --> 12:48.363
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

12:48.534 --> 12:51.697
Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.806
And the names, I think.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.236
That's not the way
the legal system works.

12:57.410 --> 13:02.109
This process is based on an objective
review of the facts, not of the lies.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.273
Objection!

13:04.851 --> 13:06.944
-It doesn't work like that either.
-Overruled.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.281
Oh, stop it.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.853
Based on what I've heard, you certainly
don't qualify for an annulment.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.994
If you don't wanna be together,
file for divorce.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.866
That's great. You happy? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

13:22.068 --> 13:26.505
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

13:27.807 --> 13:32.267
What are you typing that for?
She said we don't get the annulment.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.413
Don't type that. What..

13:34.580 --> 13:36.275
Stop typing!

13:37.216 --> 13:38.706
Stop typing!

13:39.252 --> 13:41.880
"Stop typing, stop typing!"

13:42.422 --> 13:45.858
Okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

13:46.693 --> 13:48.388
Get out of my chambers.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.051
Lady, here's the deal.

13:50.263 --> 13:54.324
I came here for an annulment and
I'm not leaving here until I get one!

13:54.500 --> 13:57.958
-Would you like a night in jail?
-Thank you for your time.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.020
That Porsche guy took his car back.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.967
But you found the keys to his clothes?

14:30.236 --> 14:34.764
No, I just love the way it feels
when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

14:34.941 --> 14:37.432
They'll think you own one
because of the clothes?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.305
Of course.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.307
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.243
That is true.

14:49.455 --> 14:52.686
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.827
Oh, I've been there.

14:56.996 --> 15:00.227
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.864
You know you don't actually have one.

15:03.035 --> 15:07.028
What are you doing? I'm in character.
Will you talk to her?

15:08.775 --> 15:11.073
I think it just moved.
It's poking me.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.109
We'll go to the emergency room.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.806
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.975
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.587
You can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.121
We're playing a zone.
They'll triple-team me!

15:26.492 --> 15:29.950
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

15:30.196 --> 15:34.155
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna...

15:34.333 --> 15:37.530
naturally pass through
his system in seven years.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.774
-I think that's gum.
-I'm pretty sure it's gun.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.374
This really hurts. Let's go.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.037
But no! A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.275
No! What would Krog do?

15:54.287 --> 15:58.485
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

15:59.992 --> 16:01.983
Maybe because you've got the keys?

16:07.500 --> 16:11.300
-That was totally your fault.
-My fault? You threatened the judge.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.440
You ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine!

16:14.607 --> 16:17.974
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

16:18.711 --> 16:20.770
Hi. How are the Gellers?

16:24.383 --> 16:27.750
Don't call us that.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.519
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!

16:33.025 --> 16:35.459
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.167
It's "Porsche-a"!

16:43.336 --> 16:46.100
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

16:46.272 --> 16:49.002
You guys feel safe, right?

16:49.175 --> 16:52.338
I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do!"

16:52.845 --> 16:57.145
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.519
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.451
Because, let's face it,
we're at Monica's.

17:06.292 --> 17:10.729
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.195
Okay. Good.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.534
Why are there only two of you?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.192
Where's Leslie?

17:18.371 --> 17:22.137
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.401
Now would be a good time
for your first words.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.480
Well, look at you!

17:31.083 --> 17:35.144
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh!

17:35.721 --> 17:38.155
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.993
Well, it'll dry.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.460
You sit with your brother
and sister now...

17:45.631 --> 17:47.394
who aren't there.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.705
How do you feel?

18:02.882 --> 18:06.613
Let's just say Krog will be equipped
to destroy the universe again...

18:06.786 --> 18:08.777
in 12 to 14 hours.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.249
I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.394
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.257
And protected them from a tornado?

18:22.201 --> 18:23.259
Oh, my God!

18:23.436 --> 18:25.961
I know. The babies are asleep.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.706
Phoebe, what happened here?

18:28.874 --> 18:31.866
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

18:32.044 --> 18:36.140
-But my apartment!
-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

18:37.483 --> 18:38.848
But the mess!

18:39.018 --> 18:42.886
Is not as important as the fact
that Phoebe took care of the babies.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.818
You're right. I shouldn't freak out.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.394
This is what it'll be like
when we have babies. When's that?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.629
Phoebe, look at this mess!

19:03.876 --> 19:07.175
Oh, honey. Thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.015
I picked up the divorce papers.

19:11.717 --> 19:16.450
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.420
Little X's. Great!
That makes up for everything.

19:20.760 --> 19:25.197
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

19:25.398 --> 19:28.231
Name one stupid thing that is
as stupid as this one.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.029
How about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

19:31.203 --> 19:33.967
You told me you loved me
after I was married.

19:34.173 --> 19:38.803
Wait, that was different. I did those
things because I was in love with you.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.468
Right.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.909
You're right. That's very different.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.520
So let's just sign the papers.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.149
What?

19:53.325 --> 19:54.622
Nothing.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.028
Okay, can we just sign, please?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.942
Congratulations.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.204
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.545
I kind of have a little confession.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.151
What?

20:20.319 --> 20:23.015
Well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.084
Kind of my idea.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.786
Excuse me?

20:27.960 --> 20:32.590
Remember how we were too drunk to
remember anything when we were married?

20:34.400 --> 20:39.428
I didn't really wanna say anything,
but it just kept coming back to me.

20:40.139 --> 20:44.838
We were in the casino and you thought
it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

20:45.644 --> 20:50.513
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

20:50.683 --> 20:55.143
So as a compromise we decided
first to get married and then...

20:55.321 --> 20:58.779
to eat a lot of grapes.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.260
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.366
So then if you think about it...

21:09.535 --> 21:12.527
this is all your fault.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.137
Yeah, don't push it, though.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.736
I gotta say...

21:21.347 --> 21:23.872
I know I divorce a lot of women.

21:27.186 --> 21:30.053
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.787
I know.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.958
I always thought if we got married,
that'd be the one that stuck.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.129
And it wouldn't be a secret...

21:39.498 --> 21:42.831
and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.801
Did I even treat?

21:46.972 --> 21:50.772
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

21:51.377 --> 21:54.175
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.941
I should get these
to my lawyer's office.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.115
Thanks for taking care of all this.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.483
No problem.

22:15.701 --> 22:18.261
-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
-Totally.

22:24.743 --> 22:27.507
Careful around my Porsche!

22:29.315 --> 22:30.407
Hi, Joey.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.347
Hey. How you doing?

22:33.819 --> 22:36.515
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.852
I'd show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.554
Would you like to go for a drink?
