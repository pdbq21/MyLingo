WEBVTT

00:03.006 --> 00:07.413
So, what's the big news you had us
rush all the way over here for?

00:07.582 --> 00:09.380
It took you 45 minutes
to cross a street.

00:09.553 --> 00:12.285
Come on, guys. It's just one baby.

00:14.395 --> 00:17.196
Oh, sure, now you guys clam up.

00:18.169 --> 00:22.736
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.

00:22.913 --> 00:25.349
So as of Monday,
I'm being officially relocated.

00:25.518 --> 00:27.214
- Oh, my God!
- What? Monday?

00:27.388 --> 00:30.793
- How long do you have to go for?
- They said it could be up to a year.

00:30.962 --> 00:33.330
- A year?
- Well, do you have to go?

00:35.872 --> 00:37.967
Well, I kind of have to, don't I?

00:38.143 --> 00:41.081
Because of this stupid thing.

00:44.121 --> 00:47.561
There's nothing like the support
of your loving wife, huh?

00:47.729 --> 00:50.063
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.

00:50.233 --> 00:54.173
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!

00:54.375 --> 00:57.108
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

00:57.582 --> 01:00.485
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

01:02.458 --> 01:06.661
You can't go. I mean, you're the glue
that holds this group together.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.605
- Really?
- Not you.

01:13.413 --> 01:15.246
This whole thing is gonna be okay.

01:15.417 --> 01:19.118
They said they'd rent us a house in
the suburbs. You guys can come and visit.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.854
Oh, God, that is so not gonna happen.

01:24.268 --> 01:26.535
I can't believe you guys are moving.

01:29.278 --> 01:31.511
- I call their apartment!
- No!

02:19.546 --> 02:21.778
- Here you go, Rach.
- Thank you, Joey.

02:21.950 --> 02:25.411
You know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

02:25.591 --> 02:29.622
I went through this with Ben and Carol.
One coffee won't affect your milk.

02:29.833 --> 02:33.773
Just to be sure,
I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

02:37.447 --> 02:39.850
Every time?

02:40.420 --> 02:43.621
You don't have to call him
whenever you have a question, okay?

02:43.794 --> 02:48.600
- Trust me. I know this.
- All right. I trust you.

02:49.138 --> 02:51.507
I can see you dialing.
I don't understand why..

02:51.677 --> 02:55.241
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

02:56.385 --> 03:00.918
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel
with a baby. It's just so grownup.

03:01.095 --> 03:05.433
I know, yeah.
I feel like we're all growing up.

03:05.605 --> 03:08.303
A person named "Wiener."
God, that kills me.

03:09.278 --> 03:13.480
- Look at you all grownup.
- Well, actually, you know what?

03:13.954 --> 03:15.445
I am, you know?

03:15.625 --> 03:18.494
Well, that whole thing
with Rachel made me realize..

03:18.664 --> 03:22.330
that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious relationship, you know?

03:22.505 --> 03:26.035
Like, I'd like to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded lady.

03:26.212 --> 03:29.309
And looks aren't as important as..

03:29.686 --> 03:31.245
Nah, she's gotta be hot.

03:32.224 --> 03:34.251
You know, I might know somebody.

03:34.461 --> 03:37.228
How about you set me up
with someone, and we double-date?

03:37.401 --> 03:39.702
I can do that. Yeah.
How's Friday?

03:39.873 --> 03:40.898
- Done!
- All right.

03:41.075 --> 03:43.238
Good, really?
Okay, let's see.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.509
All right.

03:46.887 --> 03:49.518
You know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.

03:51.195 --> 03:52.994
"Poopack"?

03:55.705 --> 04:00.009
Yeah. All right.
Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.

04:04.556 --> 04:08.621
- I've got good news.
- You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

04:08.797 --> 04:11.290
Okay, I have news.

04:11.737 --> 04:15.369
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.

04:15.544 --> 04:16.910
That's great! How?

04:17.080 --> 04:20.576
My boss and I worked out a deal
where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.

04:20.755 --> 04:22.884
So the other three,
I can be here with you.

04:23.393 --> 04:26.730
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?

04:27.735 --> 04:28.760
No.

04:28.937 --> 04:32.239
I'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?

04:34.682 --> 04:37.711
No. I can't be away
from you for that long.

04:38.222 --> 04:40.124
- Really?
- Yeah, you're my husband.

04:40.293 --> 04:44.598
I won't live in a different state
than you for 208 days out of the year.

04:45.003 --> 04:49.877
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.

04:51.382 --> 04:56.758
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.

04:57.194 --> 04:59.187
You said that without gagging.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.167
I know!

05:04.776 --> 05:06.507
Well, excuse me?

05:06.680 --> 05:10.552
Oh, yeah?
Well, up yours too!

05:11.455 --> 05:14.656
- Who the hell was that?
- Dr. Wiener.

05:16.766 --> 05:20.205
Rach, you can't call people
at 3:00 in the morning.

05:20.373 --> 05:23.608
You know what?
You sound just like his wife.

05:24.047 --> 05:26.108
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?

05:26.285 --> 05:30.385
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? I'm not insane.

05:30.961 --> 05:32.122
What was it?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.960
Hiccups.

05:35.136 --> 05:39.338
I told you, you can't call him
every time any little thing comes up.

05:39.612 --> 05:43.609
Well, not anymore I can't.
He fired us!

05:44.421 --> 05:45.822
Can you believe that?

05:45.991 --> 05:50.159
I could believe it if he came here and hit you
over the head with a copy of Highlights.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.430
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.

05:53.607 --> 05:56.237
Wait, Monica said that
when you guys were growing up..

05:56.412 --> 05:58.679
you liked your doctor.
What was his name?

05:59.017 --> 06:01.010
Dr. Gettleman?

06:01.255 --> 06:03.920
Yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:04.094 --> 06:06.428
In fact, I think he's dead.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.661
Why does everything happen to me?

06:10.039 --> 06:13.170
I promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.

06:13.346 --> 06:15.874
But I gotta get up early,
and I'm not feeling well.

06:16.051 --> 06:18.989
You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?

06:19.157 --> 06:22.323
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.469
You know, come to think of it,
it does feel rubella-like.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.191
Wiener!

06:39.364 --> 06:41.391
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

06:41.569 --> 06:42.628
Rachel!

06:43.205 --> 06:46.006
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!

06:51.422 --> 06:53.723
And the kung pao chicken.

06:53.894 --> 06:56.057
Utensils and plates for one.

06:56.231 --> 06:58.725
And can you read the order back to me?

07:09.224 --> 07:10.784
Great.

07:11.328 --> 07:13.765
Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye.

07:16.639 --> 07:20.909
So how is this
for our big double date tonight?

07:21.649 --> 07:23.481
Oh, my God.

07:24.822 --> 07:28.192
Great. Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

07:28.362 --> 07:32.029
Yeah, so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?

07:32.203 --> 07:34.674
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.

07:34.842 --> 07:38.406
She's really smart and cute
and funny and..

07:38.583 --> 07:43.924
I can't tell you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.

07:45.062 --> 07:46.189
All right.

07:46.699 --> 07:51.037
- So tell me something about my guy.
- No.

07:52.477 --> 07:55.575
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?

07:56.018 --> 07:58.888
I'm not sure I understand the question.

08:02.063 --> 08:04.534
What do they call him?

08:05.403 --> 08:08.466
- Mike.
- Mike. Okay, what's his last name?

08:08.643 --> 08:12.947
Damn it! Is there no mystery left
in romance anymore?!

08:13.118 --> 08:16.318
We'll see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a couple hours.

08:16.492 --> 08:20.455
All right, great.
See you. Bye-bye.

08:20.634 --> 08:25.337
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
a Mike! Why couldn't I have said..?

08:27.247 --> 08:30.344
There's no guys in there!

08:33.459 --> 08:36.124
So this is being a parent, huh?

08:36.498 --> 08:39.528
I think I can handle this.

08:39.705 --> 08:41.698
Too intense. Too intense.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.145
Well, I did it.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.087
I told my crew at the restaurant
I'm heading off to Tulsa.

08:50.259 --> 08:53.892
- Oh, yeah? How'd they take it.
- Pretty well. Yeah.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.504
They were brave little soldiers.

08:57.741 --> 08:59.711
Did their best to be stoic.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.851
Some of them even high-fived each other
to mask their pain.

09:05.423 --> 09:09.626
It's impossible to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones..

09:09.799 --> 09:13.397
from the ones who'll push
their penis against your knee?

09:14.809 --> 09:15.868
Excuse me?

09:16.044 --> 09:18.276
I know what she's talking about.

09:20.319 --> 09:24.487
You probably also had the piano teacher
with the wandering hands.

09:29.237 --> 09:31.640
Well, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.

09:31.809 --> 09:34.838
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.

09:35.049 --> 09:37.953
- Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
- Ross said he died.

09:38.122 --> 09:41.185
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.

09:41.361 --> 09:46.805
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

09:47.073 --> 09:49.670
Great. Well then, I'm gonna
take Emma to see him.

09:49.845 --> 09:51.644
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

09:51.816 --> 09:54.686
Maybe he confused him
with his childhood therapist.

09:54.855 --> 09:55.982
He saw a therapist?

09:56.158 --> 09:59.130
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.

09:59.297 --> 10:01.358
Wow, what was it?

10:01.536 --> 10:03.232
That I was going to eat him.

10:17.568 --> 10:19.561
Mike!

10:20.874 --> 10:22.639
Yeah?

10:25.416 --> 10:27.409
Okay.

10:31.361 --> 10:33.628
I can't believe
I'm doing this with you.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.270
Although I did just end
a nine-year relationship..

10:36.438 --> 10:38.705
so I should be open
to taking some risks.

10:38.877 --> 10:42.008
That's good.
Get all that boring stuff out now.

10:42.551 --> 10:45.283
Everything is gonna be fine.
Follow my lead, okay?

10:45.456 --> 10:47.449
All you have to do is
pretend to be Mike.

10:47.628 --> 10:49.621
- I am Mike.
- Attaboy.

10:52.771 --> 10:54.262
Here they come.

10:54.474 --> 10:56.638
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?

10:56.813 --> 10:59.808
- Nice to meet you.
- Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.

10:59.985 --> 11:03.446
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?

11:06.699 --> 11:09.135
How do Joey and I know each other?

11:09.304 --> 11:13.438
If I had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.

11:14.180 --> 11:16.583
- From school.
- We met in college.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.784
I mean high school.

11:23.031 --> 11:27.335
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?

11:27.507 --> 11:31.709
- Well, I'm a lawyer.
- Mike, attorney at law!

11:32.016 --> 11:34.510
- Actually, I just gave up my practice.
- What?

11:34.688 --> 11:38.685
That's the kind of thing
you usually run by me.

11:39.197 --> 11:43.536
I want to play piano professionally.
If I don't do this now, I never will.

11:43.706 --> 11:46.108
Great. I like that better
than the lawyer thing.

11:46.278 --> 11:50.218
Which is why I waited until now
to introduce you to Mike.

11:50.386 --> 11:52.379
You thought he was still a lawyer.

11:52.557 --> 11:55.757
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.

12:00.372 --> 12:01.534
What are you doing?

12:01.709 --> 12:04.373
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in Tulsa.

12:04.548 --> 12:06.609
That's so sweet.
Did you find anything?

12:06.786 --> 12:09.484
- Slim Pickins.
- Nothing, huh?

12:09.692 --> 12:13.655
No. Slim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.499
They're looking for a cook. Actually,
"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.

12:17.708 --> 12:20.235
They're looking for somebody
to shovel mesquite.

12:21.716 --> 12:24.118
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.

12:24.287 --> 12:27.123
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.

12:27.326 --> 12:30.127
Honey, that's okay.
I know this woman, Nancy..

12:30.299 --> 12:33.294
who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.

12:33.472 --> 12:36.137
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?

12:36.311 --> 12:41.253
When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you
for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.

12:41.822 --> 12:42.847
So Cheesy?

12:44.762 --> 12:47.062
Whole Hog?

12:47.868 --> 12:51.638
It's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in Tulsa.

12:55.717 --> 12:58.587
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

12:58.790 --> 13:04.290
I'm good. Listen, I'm looking
for a job in Tulsa.

13:04.668 --> 13:08.198
Yeah, well, my husband's
been relocated.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.903
Because I love him.

13:11.347 --> 13:13.750
No, I don't want a job in New York.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.120
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!

13:17.326 --> 13:21.289
He asked for me personally?
Oh, my God!

13:21.468 --> 13:24.930
Wow, this is really,
really flattering.

13:25.109 --> 13:27.945
But I'm moving to Tulsa.

13:28.115 --> 13:30.746
So, just, if you would tell Javu..

13:30.920 --> 13:33.288
I'll take it!

13:34.360 --> 13:37.663
My name's Rachel Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.

13:37.868 --> 13:41.808
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up
with a patient. He'll be out shortly.

13:41.976 --> 13:45.609
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.115
Thanks, doctor.

13:49.958 --> 13:54.194
- Would you like a lollipop?
- Do you even have to ask?

13:59.177 --> 14:01.306
He is alive!

14:05.657 --> 14:09.460
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so long..

14:09.631 --> 14:11.293
and I've never heard about you.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.841
That's because we had
a bit of a falling out.

14:16.010 --> 14:19.005
Mike hit my mom with a car.

14:21.487 --> 14:25.450
- No, I didn't.
- That's okay. I have forgiven you.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.896
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.832
Well, wait. Is your mom okay?

14:30.005 --> 14:33.877
Please, we're trying
to have a conversation.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.245
You're a lot nicer
on Days of Our Lives.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.016
Days of Our Lives!
That's why you look so familiar!

14:40.192 --> 14:41.285
- What?
- What?

14:41.461 --> 14:43.591
What?

14:44.166 --> 14:46.899
Do you not know each other?

14:48.241 --> 14:53.708
Of course we do. He's playing a game
we used to play in high school.

14:53.886 --> 14:57.222
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.

14:57.393 --> 15:01.835
You remember that one where I punch
you in the face for not being cool?

15:03.438 --> 15:07.208
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?

15:07.379 --> 15:10.283
- Six.
- No, he doesn't. He has seven.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.923
What are you doing? I said seven!

15:16.230 --> 15:19.498
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?

15:19.671 --> 15:23.668
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.

15:23.846 --> 15:28.253
I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.

15:28.589 --> 15:30.616
Although I'd like to be
hit by one right now.

15:30.793 --> 15:32.159
Yeah, no problem.

15:33.833 --> 15:38.537
You are unbelievable. I spent so much
time finding the perfect girl for you.

15:38.743 --> 15:41.738
Mary Ellen is really smart
and cute and loose.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.617
Who are you kidding?

15:50.900 --> 15:53.963
You find some guy
off the street for me?

15:54.140 --> 15:56.201
God, this is humiliating!

15:56.377 --> 16:00.477
I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,
I can find you a better one.

16:00.653 --> 16:03.419
Mike? Mike?

16:04.427 --> 16:05.623
I'm out of here.

16:06.097 --> 16:07.964
It was nice meeting you.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.470
- You're leaving too?
- I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

16:11.642 --> 16:12.871
Have a good night.

16:17.119 --> 16:19.955
We leave tomorrow,
and you still have a lot to pack.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.286
You're right.

16:22.196 --> 16:23.961
Maybe I shouldn't go.

16:25.135 --> 16:27.128
What?

16:27.540 --> 16:32.004
So Nancy told me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?

16:32.182 --> 16:34.448
But it's just
a little outside of Tulsa.

16:34.621 --> 16:35.953
Well, how far outside?

16:36.825 --> 16:38.316
Manhattan?

16:40.465 --> 16:43.529
And you're thinking of taking it?

16:45.308 --> 16:48.873
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.

16:49.049 --> 16:53.991
But I guess now it's
old job, me, new job.

16:55.328 --> 16:57.491
I'm gonna miss this hand!

16:59.538 --> 17:01.234
I know this is a lot to ask..

17:01.407 --> 17:04.436
but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

17:04.614 --> 17:07.609
What happened to "you can't live
without me four days a week"?

17:07.787 --> 17:12.889
Well, if you really think about it,
I mean, four days is not that long.

17:13.064 --> 17:14.931
I see you Monday
before you go to work..

17:15.101 --> 17:16.798
and Thursday when you get back..

17:17.005 --> 17:20.740
and I always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it..

17:20.913 --> 17:22.313
it's really just one day.

17:22.517 --> 17:27.516
And well, if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems, my friend.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.801
- I think you should take the job.
- Really?

17:34.975 --> 17:39.075
I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.156
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

17:44.326 --> 17:46.559
It's your dream job.
I can't make you pass it up.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.496
Besides, I'm proud of you.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.194
- You are?
- Yeah.

17:50.372 --> 17:53.276
And when I get to Tulsa and
people say, "Where's the missus"..

17:53.444 --> 17:55.745
I'll tell them she's a chef at Javu.

17:56.518 --> 17:59.284
And then, when they stare
at me blankly..

17:59.456 --> 18:03.693
I'll make some offensive Tulsa joke,
and thus, begin my isolation.

18:08.408 --> 18:11.437
- How was the pediatrician?
- I really liked him.

18:11.615 --> 18:16.283
Yeah, yeah.
It was really, really, really good.

18:16.591 --> 18:20.086
- You promised not to say anything.
- I know.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.499
Ross still sees his pediatrician!

18:25.108 --> 18:27.305
I don't care.

18:28.214 --> 18:31.482
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?

18:31.655 --> 18:33.625
He is a brilliant diagnostician!

18:33.792 --> 18:37.527
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

18:38.201 --> 18:40.729
Seriously, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.

18:40.906 --> 18:43.776
And not an orthodontist..

18:43.946 --> 18:47.009
not a gynecologist..

18:47.185 --> 18:50.055
and not a veterinarian..

18:50.258 --> 18:54.426
Why? I know it's a little weird,
but he is a great doctor, okay?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.331
He knows my medical history.

18:56.538 --> 18:59.407
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deal.

18:59.577 --> 19:02.104
You know,
"Look, it's my favorite patient."

19:02.282 --> 19:05.949
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?

19:06.123 --> 19:10.792
I seem to remember someone bringing
his security blanket to college.

19:10.966 --> 19:13.870
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.

19:14.072 --> 19:16.133
It didn't spend much time on the wall!

19:26.297 --> 19:28.164
Excuse me.

19:28.902 --> 19:32.363
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Can we talk?

19:32.777 --> 19:33.972
Sure.

19:34.614 --> 19:36.777
Yeah. There's someone
I want you to meet.

19:36.952 --> 19:40.118
This is my best friend from high school.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.957
I'm sorry, I don't think I know you.

19:44.132 --> 19:45.761
How hard was that?

19:46.738 --> 19:50.404
Look, I'm sorry, really.
I'm so embarrassed.

19:52.215 --> 19:53.775
Please.

19:54.019 --> 19:59.052
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.

20:02.002 --> 20:05.441
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.

20:06.878 --> 20:10.180
Well, why did you go along with that?

20:10.351 --> 20:15.590
Because I was told that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.

20:15.763 --> 20:18.997
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,
which I did.

20:21.373 --> 20:23.503
That's true.

20:26.618 --> 20:29.214
Well, is anything you told me
about yourself true?

20:29.389 --> 20:32.384
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.

20:32.563 --> 20:36.332
- Prove it.
- There isn't a piano here.

20:36.538 --> 20:40.102
That wouldn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.

20:40.846 --> 20:42.246
Okay.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.308
You are really good.

21:04.727 --> 21:08.166
- I play a little guitar myself.
- Really? That's great.

21:08.334 --> 21:12.001
- What kind of music do you play?
- Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?

21:12.175 --> 21:17.049
But right now I'm working on
a couple lron Maiden covers.

21:18.622 --> 21:24.259
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, I could..

21:24.433 --> 21:26.870
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

21:28.274 --> 21:32.009
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime I could take you out?

21:32.683 --> 21:34.880
You just caught me off guard.

21:36.023 --> 21:37.822
Yeah, that would be nice.

21:38.027 --> 21:40.658
Look at this! My two best friends!

21:48.214 --> 21:51.015
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be a jerk..

21:51.186 --> 21:54.717
but the baby with the rash
came in after me.

21:55.562 --> 21:58.362
- The doctor will be right with you, sir.
- I hear you..

21:58.535 --> 22:00.664
but do you have any harder puzzles?

22:06.551 --> 22:08.612
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

22:08.788 --> 22:10.313
What page are you on?

22:10.491 --> 22:12.928
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.

22:13.097 --> 22:16.832
Wow. So your child's a big fan
of the Waldo books too?

22:19.209 --> 22:22.238
Yeah, that's how I know.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.945
- I'm Ross, by the way.
- Hi, I'm Sally.

22:26.123 --> 22:29.927
So no ring. Can I assume
you're also a single parent?

22:30.097 --> 22:33.867
- I am a single parent.
- It's hard, isn't it?

22:34.039 --> 22:37.535
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?

22:37.713 --> 22:39.306
- Well..
- Mommy, I can't..

22:39.482 --> 22:41.646
Sea shore? Row boat.

22:45.261 --> 22:50.329
Let's say, I don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office.

22:51.608 --> 22:53.976
Rossie? We're ready for you.

23:02.395 --> 23:03.887
Yeah..

23:05.969 --> 23:10.000
Come on, Ross Jr.
It's time to go in.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.339
Mommy.

23:17.292 --> 23:19.387
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

23:19.563 --> 23:21.931
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

23:29.517 --> 23:32.648
- Good, you haven't left yet.
- Where have you been?

23:32.823 --> 23:36.227
I got held up
at Dr. Gettleman's office.

23:36.430 --> 23:41.134
There was some guy
that freaked everybody out.

23:41.340 --> 23:44.335
I don't think I'm going back there.

23:44.547 --> 23:47.245
You got here just in time.
I really have to go, buddy.

23:47.418 --> 23:48.443
Oh, man.

23:48.621 --> 23:52.458
- Promise to call me when you land?
- Of course I will. I love you.

23:52.629 --> 23:53.790
I love you too.

23:58.942 --> 24:02.848
Watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.

24:03.350 --> 24:06.186
- Bye, Chandler.
- Bye.

24:06.356 --> 24:08.725
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

24:13.137 --> 24:16.975
- What's the matter, Joe?
- I'm mad at you for leaving.

24:17.145 --> 24:20.949
You know, you're nothing
but a big leaver.

24:21.253 --> 24:24.658
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

24:26.564 --> 24:31.369
Any chance you're trying to pick
a fight to make all of this easier?

24:34.145 --> 24:37.379
Dude, you see right through me!

24:46.303 --> 24:48.706
Okay, well.. Bye, Mon.

24:49.375 --> 24:51.402
Bye, Ross. Rachel.

24:52.014 --> 24:55.180
- Bye, Emma.
- Okay, bye-bye.

24:55.354 --> 24:58.555
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.

25:02.703 --> 25:04.536
Wait.

25:05.942 --> 25:08.914
It goes old job..

25:09.082 --> 25:11.143
new job..

25:11.353 --> 25:12.549
and you.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.721
This is just something I have to do.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.326
I know.

25:19.503 --> 25:21.837
I love you so much.

25:22.008 --> 25:24.639
I know that too.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.972
Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.

25:39.142 --> 25:40.907
Yes, it will be the same.

25:41.681 --> 25:44.277
Because I know, that's how.

25:44.452 --> 25:45.512
I promise.

25:45.689 --> 25:47.021
You double promise?

25:51.667 --> 25:53.295
Call me when you land.

25:54.873 --> 25:57.241
- Can I talk now?
- Okay, bye.

25:57.445 --> 25:59.278
- Joey!
- He had to board.
