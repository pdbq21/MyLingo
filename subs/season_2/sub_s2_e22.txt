WEBVTT

00:06.774 --> 00:09.334
I'll get candles and
my mom's lace tablecloth.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.703
And since it's Rachel's birthday...

00:11.946 --> 00:14.141
...I thought I'd poach a salmon.

00:14.982 --> 00:15.846
What?

00:16.050 --> 00:20.180
Question. Why do we always
have parties where you poach things?

00:20.388 --> 00:21.878
You want to be on the food committee?

00:22.189 --> 00:25.215
Question 2. Why do we always
have parties with committees?

00:25.693 --> 00:29.527
Why can't we just get pizza
and beer and have fun?

00:29.730 --> 00:33.791
I agree. Fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.696
And I'm not sure we are.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.401
You don't want it to be special?

00:39.707 --> 00:42.301
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.375
Joey, they're not real!

00:46.414 --> 00:49.577
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things. They're fake.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.374
See?
Honk, honk!

00:52.887 --> 00:56.050
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

00:57.691 --> 00:59.716
The One With Two Parties

01:44.807 --> 01:47.640
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

01:47.876 --> 01:51.312
I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

01:52.481 --> 01:53.709
No Shannon Cooper.

01:53.916 --> 01:55.178
Why not her?

01:55.484 --> 01:56.382
Because she....

01:56.585 --> 01:58.314
She steals stuff.

02:00.823 --> 02:05.760
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept
with her and never called her back.

02:07.696 --> 02:09.323
Joey, that is horrible.

02:09.531 --> 02:10.759
Hey, I liked her.

02:10.999 --> 02:12.330
Maybe too much.

02:12.568 --> 02:14.092
I don't know.

02:14.336 --> 02:16.566
I guess I just got scared.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.537
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

02:20.542 --> 02:23.272
I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay!

02:24.780 --> 02:26.213
Hi, honey.
How did it go?

02:26.415 --> 02:28.349
It was the graduation from hell.

02:28.584 --> 02:31.849
My cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

02:32.788 --> 02:35.086
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

02:35.357 --> 02:38.417
My sister would graduate from college.
Nobody thought she would.

02:38.894 --> 02:42.887
It's a testament to what a girl
from Long lsland will do for a Celica.

02:43.966 --> 02:44.864
What happened?

02:45.067 --> 02:46.227
My parents happened.

02:46.435 --> 02:49.404
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile...

02:49.638 --> 02:52.801
...and not talk about the divorce.
But no!

02:53.041 --> 02:55.601
They got into a fight
during the commencement address.

02:55.878 --> 02:59.871
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

03:02.217 --> 03:03.582
You know the good news?

03:03.785 --> 03:06.447
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

03:08.557 --> 03:10.855
I guess we don't invite her parents.

03:11.059 --> 03:13.459
-How about just her mom?
-Why her mom?

03:13.929 --> 03:15.829
Because I already invited her.

03:16.431 --> 03:18.399
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

03:18.634 --> 03:19.896
Can't invite her.

03:22.804 --> 03:24.135
She also steals.

03:27.135 --> 03:30.135
So does her roomate.

03:37.579 --> 03:40.446
Here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

03:40.682 --> 03:42.582
We're not having birthday cake.

03:42.851 --> 03:44.580
We're having birthday flan.

03:46.922 --> 03:47.889
Excuse me?

03:48.090 --> 03:50.024
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

03:50.259 --> 03:51.624
That's nice.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.556
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo!

04:01.370 --> 04:02.735
Dr. Greene!

04:03.205 --> 04:05.036
Oh, my God!
It's Rachel's dad.

04:07.709 --> 04:08.971
Why are you here?

04:09.244 --> 04:11.940
The father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?

04:12.147 --> 04:13.944
No, no, the father can.

04:14.216 --> 04:17.947
But since I am the roommate,
I can tell you she's not here.

04:18.220 --> 04:21.246
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

04:21.623 --> 04:23.386
You're having a party.

04:24.326 --> 04:26.317
No, no, not a party.

04:26.562 --> 04:29.656
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

04:29.898 --> 04:33.595
-This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.
-I'll never remember all that.

04:34.136 --> 04:36.161
So what's the deal?

04:36.438 --> 04:40.067
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

04:40.309 --> 04:43.767
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

04:46.682 --> 04:48.172
Hi, Monica.

04:51.286 --> 04:54.187
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

04:54.456 --> 04:57.118
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

04:58.827 --> 05:02.991
Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

05:05.701 --> 05:08.636
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

05:12.174 --> 05:14.472
Well, my goodness!
What was that?

05:14.710 --> 05:18.339
Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.
We weren't ready for you yet.

05:18.547 --> 05:22.313
-You thought I was Rachel?
-Yes, because you look so young.

05:22.551 --> 05:25.111
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

05:27.856 --> 05:32.020
Oh, I missed you kids.
Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

05:34.496 --> 05:37.624
-No, I'll take that for you.
-Oh, well, thank you.

05:37.866 --> 05:40.130
Such a gentleman.
Thank you.

05:43.205 --> 05:47.005
It all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

05:48.076 --> 05:51.568
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

05:51.847 --> 05:54.315
-I was driving
-That's great!

05:57.552 --> 06:00.885
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

06:01.156 --> 06:02.817
Hey, come with me.

06:03.325 --> 06:05.555
-What?
-lt will be like we're gal pals.

06:05.827 --> 06:08.557
You know, like at a restaurant.
It'll be fun! Come on.

06:14.569 --> 06:16.366
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

06:16.605 --> 06:18.095
Think. Think.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.535
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

06:22.444 --> 06:25.880
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed

06:26.114 --> 06:28.446
We can come back out
in the living room.

06:28.717 --> 06:33.017
Joey and Chandler, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

06:33.221 --> 06:35.086
Yes, absolutely.

06:36.525 --> 06:37.355
Why, again?

06:38.760 --> 06:41.228
Because that's where
the party is, you goon!

06:42.964 --> 06:46.798
-See, this is just the staging area.
-Right, it's the staging area.

06:47.069 --> 06:50.038
This is clearly
in the wrong apartment.

06:55.210 --> 06:58.771
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

07:00.215 --> 07:01.876
And you....

07:02.117 --> 07:04.551
You are off to party number two.

07:05.153 --> 07:08.281
All right, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

07:10.592 --> 07:13.083
At least send some women to my party.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.298
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

07:18.333 --> 07:19.800
Okay, they're coming.

07:27.008 --> 07:29.306
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

07:29.911 --> 07:31.742
Thanks for being born.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.040
Thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.410
I love you.

07:37.252 --> 07:40.346
Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

07:41.089 --> 07:43.148
Now I love you even more.

07:48.663 --> 07:49.595
Surprise!

07:50.432 --> 07:51.922
Oh, my gosh!

07:52.167 --> 07:53.031
Wow!

07:54.269 --> 07:55.930
Oh, my God. Mom!

07:56.138 --> 07:57.435
This is so great!

07:57.839 --> 07:59.830
Happy birthday, sweetie.

08:01.443 --> 08:04.071
You! I had no idea!

08:04.279 --> 08:05.473
-Really?
-No, I knew.

08:05.714 --> 08:06.874
All right.

08:07.983 --> 08:10.281
There's food and drinks on the table.

08:10.552 --> 08:13.146
Go across the hall.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's.

08:13.388 --> 08:14.650
-Why?
-Just go.

08:17.325 --> 08:18.314
Weird.

08:18.527 --> 08:19.516
Surprise!

08:23.165 --> 08:25.292
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

08:25.534 --> 08:26.626
Daddy!

08:34.607 --> 08:37.576
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

08:37.843 --> 08:40.175
Well, we could count again?

08:40.913 --> 08:42.244
I can't believe this!

08:42.448 --> 08:44.006
You know, this is ridiculous.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.514
This is your birthday, your party.

08:46.719 --> 08:49.916
Let's put them together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

08:50.122 --> 08:52.181
-I do.
-That's who.

08:54.093 --> 08:55.424
Are you gonna be okay?

08:55.628 --> 08:59.462
I don't really have a choice.
I can look at the bright side.

08:59.698 --> 09:02.565
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

09:02.801 --> 09:04.029
Well, actually...

09:04.603 --> 09:06.730
...just one birthday flan.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.605
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

09:12.878 --> 09:15.438
Talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

09:22.288 --> 09:25.815
Some girl just walked up to me
and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

09:26.058 --> 09:28.458
...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.

09:28.894 --> 09:30.122
I love this party!

09:31.330 --> 09:33.423
-Quick volleyball question.
-Volleyball.

09:33.666 --> 09:35.634
We set up a court in your room.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.302
You didn't like
that gray lamp, did you?

09:39.438 --> 09:43.636
A woman stuck her tongue down my throat.
I'm not even listening to you.

09:44.109 --> 09:46.805
-Dennis!
-Okay, that's me.

09:48.247 --> 09:52.183
Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

09:52.451 --> 09:54.942
Do you have any ideas
for any openers?

09:55.788 --> 09:58.848
Stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

09:59.124 --> 10:01.115
...and you should be okay.

10:03.329 --> 10:05.320
I want you to take a piece of paper

10:05.531 --> 10:09.490
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

10:10.002 --> 10:14.496
When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...

10:14.707 --> 10:16.766
... because they will dry out.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.109
Hi, Dr. Greene.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.178
So how's everything in the...

10:23.882 --> 10:25.850
...vascular surgery...

10:26.352 --> 10:27.182
...game?

10:28.520 --> 10:31.978
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

10:32.558 --> 10:33.820
I'm sorry.

10:35.861 --> 10:38.056
That's the good thing about my job.

10:38.297 --> 10:41.562
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

10:44.203 --> 10:46.831
Listen, I don't mean
to be a pain about this...

10:47.039 --> 10:50.167
... but I've noticed some of you
are just placing them on.

10:50.376 --> 10:52.241
You want to push the caps...

10:54.179 --> 10:56.238
... until you hear them click.

10:58.017 --> 10:58.847
Gunther!

10:59.051 --> 11:00.018
Where you going?

11:00.219 --> 11:02.881
I was sort of thinking about maybe

11:03.155 --> 11:06.147
No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.

11:06.425 --> 11:08.893
We're just starting.
Here's your marker.

11:12.164 --> 11:14.894
If you want to go, just go.

11:15.167 --> 11:17.067
She'll yell at me again.

11:20.439 --> 11:22.270
All right, I can get you out.

11:22.508 --> 11:23.566
What?

11:25.277 --> 11:27.768
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

11:28.013 --> 11:31.676
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

11:32.718 --> 11:35.687
-I think I need a drink.
-I'll get it for you.

11:35.921 --> 11:37.912
-What do you want?
-Scotch.

11:38.123 --> 11:42.457
I'll be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

11:42.761 --> 11:43.591
Neat!

11:44.263 --> 11:45.252
Cool.

11:46.298 --> 11:49.131
Neat, as in no rocks.

11:50.002 --> 11:50.900
I know.

11:54.907 --> 11:58.308
Hello, Ross!
Where have you been?

11:59.011 --> 12:01.878
I have been in the bathroom.

12:02.915 --> 12:05.406
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

12:09.888 --> 12:11.549
Scotch neat.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.083
That's Rachel's father's drink.

12:16.095 --> 12:18.529
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.059
Scotch neat.

12:23.736 --> 12:25.829
Would you excuse me?

12:31.910 --> 12:34.572
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

12:35.581 --> 12:37.208
I'm getting my cigarettes.

12:37.416 --> 12:38.348
No.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.915
What do you mean "no"?

12:40.586 --> 12:42.850
See, because that's the staging area.

12:43.122 --> 12:46.683
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.852
Take your scotch back in there...

12:50.062 --> 12:53.395
...and I will get
your cigarettes for you, sir.

12:53.766 --> 12:56.860
-Get my glasses too.
-All righty-roo.

13:00.439 --> 13:03.567
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

13:06.879 --> 13:11.248
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is...

13:11.483 --> 13:13.542
... "Monica, your party sucks."

13:14.653 --> 13:15.950
Very funny.

13:16.622 --> 13:19.921
Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?

13:20.125 --> 13:21.285
What?

13:28.467 --> 13:29.934
I don't see anything.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.397
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

13:36.408 --> 13:38.808
Ross, whose glasses are those?

13:39.745 --> 13:40.803
Mine.

13:42.581 --> 13:44.105
You wear bifocals?

13:46.185 --> 13:49.245
I have a condition apparently...

13:49.454 --> 13:51.319
...that I require...

13:52.791 --> 13:55.089
...two different sets of focals.

13:56.128 --> 13:59.529
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

13:59.765 --> 14:02.427
Well, those are very popular frames.

14:02.701 --> 14:04.794
Neil Sedaka wears them.

14:07.773 --> 14:10.264
I hear you can get people out of here.

14:14.346 --> 14:17.543
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

14:17.783 --> 14:19.182
Yeah, like a chimney.

14:20.953 --> 14:22.113
Big smoker.

14:23.722 --> 14:25.485
Big, big smoker.

14:25.791 --> 14:29.693
In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.066
Are you wearing my glasses?

14:46.578 --> 14:47.545
Yes.

14:50.215 --> 14:54.083
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

14:55.020 --> 14:55.987
Thank you.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.558
Is that one of my cigarettes?

15:07.099 --> 15:11.001
Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.

15:12.938 --> 15:16.339
She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

15:16.608 --> 15:18.940
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.109
What about my friend?

15:20.345 --> 15:23.872
Only the three of you.
Any more and she'll get suspicious.

15:24.082 --> 15:26.676
-Let me just get my coat.
-There isn't time!

15:29.121 --> 15:30.588
Just leave everything.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.354
They'll take care of you next door.

15:33.926 --> 15:35.757
Is it true they have beer?

15:37.029 --> 15:39.361
Everything you've heard is true.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.598
Could you guys please keep it down?

15:42.801 --> 15:45.599
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

15:45.599 --> 15:50.599
True, if these people find out a funny game,
then will be no people left in our party.

15:56.442 --> 15:57.272
You!

15:57.510 --> 15:58.602
And you.

15:58.845 --> 16:00.745
You're supposed to be at my party.

16:01.014 --> 16:02.845
And Gunther!

16:07.453 --> 16:09.080
What are you doing here?

16:12.992 --> 16:14.687
Welcome to the fo

16:18.831 --> 16:21.766
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

16:21.968 --> 16:24.266
They work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

16:24.470 --> 16:26.700
They deserve to have a little fun.
Go!

16:27.940 --> 16:29.703
You know, my party is fun.

16:29.976 --> 16:32.604
It's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

16:32.812 --> 16:35.940
But if people would just
give it a chance, it's

16:40.219 --> 16:44.781
-You want me to see a therapist?
-Sweetheart, you have a problem.

16:44.991 --> 16:48.654
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.861
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

16:52.131 --> 16:55.328
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.

16:55.535 --> 17:00.404
Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

17:00.807 --> 17:02.536
I felt like Gulliver.

17:03.576 --> 17:06.409
Daddy, I really want
to hear more about this...

17:06.679 --> 17:09.842
...but I just have to do some stuff.

17:10.049 --> 17:13.041
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

17:13.252 --> 17:15.652
... but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

17:15.922 --> 17:18.686
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

17:18.925 --> 17:21.826
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

17:22.061 --> 17:23.995
And you sand it and varnish it.

17:24.230 --> 17:27.859
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

17:28.067 --> 17:31.059
One night of her yoga
and Bridges of Madison County....

17:31.337 --> 17:34.101
-The scotch, the cigarettes....
- The bonsais and the Chihuahua....

17:34.340 --> 17:36.604
I may have only been in therapy
for three weeks now but

17:36.876 --> 17:39.344
What the hell does she want
with half a boat?

17:43.216 --> 17:46.743
Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'll be skins.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.551
I'll be skins!

17:56.295 --> 17:58.559
How you holding up there, big tiger?

18:00.266 --> 18:04.134
Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."

18:04.971 --> 18:08.407
I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports."

18:08.741 --> 18:09.935
I even got a "governor."

18:12.478 --> 18:15.879
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my life will be like.

18:16.249 --> 18:18.308
My mom there, my dad there.

18:18.618 --> 18:21.109
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

18:21.320 --> 18:25.916
She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister will decorate with wicker.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.956
How did you get through this?

18:31.130 --> 18:34.065
I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

18:34.300 --> 18:35.824
...of denial...

18:36.769 --> 18:38.634
...and wetting the bed.

18:41.474 --> 18:43.806
You know, I just
It's so weird.

18:44.076 --> 18:48.740
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

18:48.948 --> 18:51.746
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

18:53.352 --> 18:55.286
Because it reminded you of the way...

18:55.488 --> 18:58.184
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

18:59.091 --> 19:01.753
It's just this thing.
Every year we would...

19:01.994 --> 19:04.758
...go out on my dad's boat
and watch the fireworks.

19:05.298 --> 19:09.325
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

19:09.535 --> 19:12.698
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

19:13.039 --> 19:15.701
...and Dad would be upset
because nobody helping.

19:15.975 --> 19:19.103
And when we did help, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.

19:22.315 --> 19:26.513
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

19:27.053 --> 19:29.317
You know, and it'd get really cold.

19:29.555 --> 19:33.184
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

19:33.459 --> 19:36.553
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

19:38.297 --> 19:39.730
And now it's....

19:43.469 --> 19:44.868
Yeah, I know.

20:08.194 --> 20:10.185
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.

20:10.596 --> 20:12.587
All right, I'm hitting the road.

20:12.832 --> 20:15.733
Now, I've left my 10 verbs
on the table.

20:15.935 --> 20:18.233
Be sure and send me
that finished poem.

20:18.504 --> 20:20.369
Okay, will do. Glad you came.

20:20.673 --> 20:23.733
-I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
-Let me go check.

20:26.445 --> 20:28.379
Your mom wants to say goodbye.

20:28.681 --> 20:30.615
Happy birthday, sweetie.

20:33.853 --> 20:34.877
You drive safe.

20:36.689 --> 20:38.054
What are you doing?

20:39.425 --> 20:42.792
I'm getting ready
for the water skiing.

20:43.029 --> 20:45.293
Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on!

20:48.301 --> 20:49.427
How are you?

20:51.871 --> 20:53.805
-Where are you going?
-To get my coat.

20:54.073 --> 20:55.472
We'll get that for you.

20:55.741 --> 20:58.710
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

21:06.485 --> 21:09.079
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

21:11.791 --> 21:14.555
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

21:14.794 --> 21:18.127
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

21:18.831 --> 21:21.163
You know, just get out.

21:30.076 --> 21:32.340
Or perhaps you'd like
a creme de menthe.

21:33.913 --> 21:36.006
I have to be heading
toward my chateau.

21:36.282 --> 21:39.080
I guess we're going back
into the hallway again.

21:39.318 --> 21:41.286
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.590
You take care.

21:59.138 --> 22:00.765
Oh, you kids.

22:03.642 --> 22:04.506
Well.

22:06.212 --> 22:09.340
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

22:10.316 --> 22:11.476
Thank you!

22:17.323 --> 22:19.484
Okay, everybody,
it's time for flan!

22:19.725 --> 22:23.058
Yep! Get ready
for the gelatinous fun.

22:24.063 --> 22:27.430
Looks like that stuff you get
when you get an infection.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.429
Okay, that's enough.

22:29.668 --> 22:32.432
Okay, Rachel,
make a special flan wish.

22:33.739 --> 22:35.331
Okay, I've got one.

22:39.645 --> 22:40.771
Heads up!

22:42.782 --> 22:45.842
Wow! Those things almost
never come true.
