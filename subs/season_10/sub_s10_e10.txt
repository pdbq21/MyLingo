00:05.713 --> 00:07.865
This cake is amazing!

00:08.035 --> 00:10.632
My God, get a room.

00:11.158 --> 00:12.752
I would get a room with this cake.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.038
I think I could show
this cake a good time.

00:16.363 --> 00:19.403
If you had to, what would
you give up, food or sex?

00:19.567 --> 00:21.560
Sex.

00:22.810 --> 00:24.564
Seriously, answer faster.

00:25.332 --> 00:26.687
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

00:26.854 --> 00:29.929
But when she said "sex,"
I wasn't thinking about sex with you.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.697
It's like a giant hug.

00:35.863 --> 00:38.174
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up?

00:38.345 --> 00:40.019
Food.

00:40.187 --> 00:41.588
How about sex or dinosaurs?

00:46.514 --> 00:49.873
Oh, my God, it's like Sophie's Choice.

00:50.237 --> 00:51.513
Oh, God.

00:51.679 --> 00:54.320
What about you, Joe?
What would you give up, sex or food?

00:58.285 --> 00:59.925
I don't know, it's too hard.

01:00.247 --> 01:02.399
No, you gotta pick one.

01:03.611 --> 01:05.330
Food. No, sex.

01:05.492 --> 01:09.011
Food. Sex. Food. Sex...
I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!

01:09.176 --> 01:11.932
I want...
I want girls on bread!

01:13.901 --> 01:15.894
The One Where Chandler Gets Caught

01:51.779 --> 01:55.297
- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute!

01:55.462 --> 01:58.742
- She looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no, that is a doll.

01:58.906 --> 02:01.628
Oh, thank God,
because that thing's really creepy.

02:04.552 --> 02:06.430
Look, there's Chandler.

02:06.834 --> 02:08.906
Who's the blond? She's pretty.

02:09.116 --> 02:10.391
He's having an affair.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.956
He is not having an affair!

02:13.120 --> 02:14.999
I'm always right about these things.

02:15.162 --> 02:18.681
No, you're not. Last week,
you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

02:18.846 --> 02:22.559
Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...

02:22.730 --> 02:24.609
...just to tell it.

02:26.053 --> 02:27.932
There's something going on with them.

02:28.095 --> 02:30.088
Look!
He's getting into the car with her.

02:30.257 --> 02:31.738
That doesn't mean anything.

02:31.899 --> 02:33.732
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.

02:35.903 --> 02:37.702
Okay, duck down.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.299
- Hello?
- Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.

02:44.471 --> 02:46.225
I know that Monica is working today...

02:46.393 --> 02:49.946
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
come to the movies with me and Rachel.

02:50.518 --> 02:55.038
Oh, I have to work too. Yeah,
I'm stuck here at the office all day.

02:58.285 --> 03:00.482
Well, it's a shame
that you'll miss the movie...

03:00.648 --> 03:04.884
...because we were gonna see,
you know, either Liar Liar...

03:06.093 --> 03:11.047
...or Betrayal
or An Affair to Remember.

03:11.619 --> 03:13.612
Those are all really old.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.732
Okay, then maybe it'll be...

03:16.904 --> 03:18.578
Dude, Where's My Car?

03:19.306 --> 03:22.062
- What?
- They're in a car.

03:23.270 --> 03:26.185
Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.

03:26.554 --> 03:27.829
Jeez!

03:27.995 --> 03:30.671
Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab
and follow them.

03:30.838 --> 03:34.915
Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my
night-vision goggles and my stun gun.

03:35.322 --> 03:37.235
I got them.

03:41.328 --> 03:43.640
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.

03:43.851 --> 03:46.321
Hey, you smell like
perfume and cigarettes.

03:46.493 --> 03:49.010
- I was in the car with Nancy.
- Nancy doesn't smoke.

03:49.176 --> 03:52.216
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.

03:53.541 --> 03:56.341
So... What did you think of the house?

03:56.504 --> 03:58.382
It's everything we've been looking for.

03:58.546 --> 04:01.142
Isn't it? And what about
the amazing wanes coating...

04:01.308 --> 04:03.950
...the crown molding
and the dormer windows in the attic?

04:04.111 --> 04:06.343
And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!

04:07.955 --> 04:09.675
What were the things you said?

04:09.837 --> 04:12.673
- Don't you love the huge yard?
- The fireplace in the bedroom.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.753
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...

04:14.922 --> 04:18.714
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!

04:18.886 --> 04:21.608
This is bringing out a lovely color in you.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.921
So do you think we should get it?

04:25.092 --> 04:26.573
I don't know. What do you think?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.134
- I think we should.
- I do too.

04:28.295 --> 04:30.766
This is huge. How bad do you wanna
smoke right now?

04:30.978 --> 04:33.859
I don't know what you mean,
giant, talking cigarette.

04:35.062 --> 04:37.294
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.

04:37.464 --> 04:39.343
If she asks you, I was at work all day.

04:39.507 --> 04:41.260
Got you. When do we tell them?

04:41.428 --> 04:44.947
We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?

04:45.112 --> 04:46.387
Okay. Right.

04:46.554 --> 04:51.393
- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
- I know. Good luck with it.

04:53.801 --> 04:55.998
I just can't see Chandler cheating.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.557
I'm telling you guys, we followed
them out to a house in Westchester.

04:59.727 --> 05:04.202
They went in for 45 minutes, and then
they came out looking pretty happy.

05:05.893 --> 05:07.407
Chandler?

05:07.575 --> 05:09.055
Forty-five minutes?

05:11.098 --> 05:12.738
Well, something's not right.

05:14.221 --> 05:16.020
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.301
I know, and with the baby coming?

05:18.465 --> 05:20.618
- So should we tell her?
- I don't know.

05:20.788 --> 05:24.546
If one of us saw Mike with another
woman, would you want us to tell you?

05:24.712 --> 05:26.909
Why? Who'd you see him with?

05:27.074 --> 05:30.353
- No one. I'm just saying if we did...
- Tell me what you know!

05:30.558 --> 05:34.635
No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy!
It was hypothetical!

05:35.482 --> 05:37.919
All right. He is a good guy.

05:38.085 --> 05:40.078
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.

05:40.487 --> 05:42.720
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way I...

05:42.890 --> 05:44.883
Who did you see him with?

05:58.345 --> 06:01.021
Oh, look at her. So happy.

06:04.471 --> 06:07.626
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.

06:10.277 --> 06:12.156
Hey, is Chandler here?

06:12.319 --> 06:14.471
No, he's picking up dinner.
Why? What's up?

06:18.325 --> 06:22.004
Look, whatever happens,
we're here for you, and we love you.

06:23.691 --> 06:27.323
- All right.
- Chandler might be having an affair.

06:27.695 --> 06:30.131
- What?
- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...

06:30.297 --> 06:33.417
...with a blond woman today
outside on the street.

06:33.581 --> 06:36.940
And then we followed them
to a house in Westchester.

06:37.104 --> 06:40.463
They went in together. I'm so sorry.

06:43.511 --> 06:47.223
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.

06:48.435 --> 06:50.633
What did you think of the house?

06:53.721 --> 06:55.075
What?

06:55.282 --> 06:57.594
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?

06:57.765 --> 07:02.399
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
I'm devastated, obviously.

07:03.410 --> 07:06.086
Did you think the neighborhood
was homey?

07:07.615 --> 07:10.690
- Hey.
- You son of a bitch.

07:12.139 --> 07:15.214
Is it me, or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?

07:16.023 --> 07:19.736
Phoebe and Rachel
saw you with Nancy today.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.581
They think you're having an affair.

07:21.749 --> 07:23.468
- Who's Nancy?
- What's going on?

07:24.872 --> 07:26.626
Okay...

07:26.794 --> 07:28.228
All right, you better sit down.

07:28.395 --> 07:30.992
- This is... This is pretty big.
- Yeah.

07:34.201 --> 07:35.682
I'm not having an affair.

07:35.843 --> 07:39.840
Nancy is our realtor.

07:40.007 --> 07:43.560
I knew he couldn't be
with a woman for 45 minutes!

07:46.734 --> 07:48.613
Why do you have a realtor?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.858
She's been showing
us houses outside of the city.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.656
- What?
- Are you serious?

07:55.823 --> 07:58.339
When we found out
that we were gonna get this baby...

07:58.506 --> 08:01.660
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.662
So you're... So you're gonna move?

08:04.031 --> 08:05.705
Oh, my God.

08:06.313 --> 08:08.955
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

08:10.317 --> 08:12.469
What is wrong with raising a kid
in the city?

08:12.640 --> 08:14.997
I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.520
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!

08:18.365 --> 08:21.839
And that's great for you guys,
but we want a lawn and a swing set.

08:22.009 --> 08:24.127
A street where our kids
can ride their bikes...

08:24.291 --> 08:26.284
...and maybe an ice-cream truck
can go by.

08:26.453 --> 08:29.016
So you want to buy a house in the '50s.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.616
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.852
You can't move out of the city.
What if...?

08:35.022 --> 08:37.015
What if you want Chinese food
at 5 a. M?

08:37.184 --> 08:39.906
Or a fake Rolex that breaks
as soon as it rains?

08:40.067 --> 08:43.301
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?

08:44.311 --> 08:47.751
You know what? If you want to look
for a house, that's okay.

08:47.915 --> 08:50.830
No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.

08:52.439 --> 08:55.799
It's okay, because they have
to get it out of their system.

08:56.243 --> 09:00.764
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you want to be.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.524
Actually...

09:04.692 --> 09:06.411
...we already found a house we love.

09:06.574 --> 09:10.810
- What?
- About an hour ago, we made an offer.

09:16.984 --> 09:19.501
Bet you wish I was
having an affair now, huh?

09:25.432 --> 09:29.065
- You put an offer on a house?
- It's so sweet.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.470
It really is. It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.519
And then there's these old maple trees.

09:34.682 --> 09:37.244
Oh, again with the nature.
What are you, beavers?

09:37.845 --> 09:40.441
Look, I know this is really hard,
and we're really sorry.

09:40.608 --> 09:43.728
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?

09:43.891 --> 09:46.009
Because I can stop doing that.

09:46.173 --> 09:48.450
I really, really think I can.

09:48.616 --> 09:50.927
You know that's not the reason, Joe.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.861
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.

09:59.026 --> 10:01.223
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

10:04.071 --> 10:06.303
- Yeah, it is.
- What the hell are you doing?

10:06.473 --> 10:10.152
Well, it is, all right? When we were
out there today, all I kept thinking was:

10:10.317 --> 10:12.595
"I can't believe Chandler's
screwing this woman...

10:12.760 --> 10:14.992
...but, man, this would be
a nice place to live!"

10:15.402 --> 10:17.235
Yeah, but so is this.

10:17.404 --> 10:20.319
Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
you have to leave here.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.845
I mean, how can you leave this place?

10:25.893 --> 10:28.170
Come on, Daddy, listen!

10:28.335 --> 10:31.934
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

10:32.099 --> 10:34.536
"You're a shoe! You're a shoe.
You're a shoe!"

10:34.702 --> 10:37.583
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't want to be a shoe?

10:37.745 --> 10:39.703
What if I want to be a purse?

10:39.867 --> 10:42.942
Or a hat?"

10:43.511 --> 10:45.981
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
l...

10:46.153 --> 10:48.271
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

10:49.917 --> 10:51.910
You can see where he'd have trouble.

10:54.522 --> 10:56.434
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.718
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

11:03.611 --> 11:05.443
Your money's mine, Greene.

11:05.613 --> 11:07.252
Your fly's open, Geller.

11:09.056 --> 11:10.456
You know what I just realized?

11:10.618 --> 11:13.738
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J"!

11:15.583 --> 11:17.415
Coincidence?

11:17.585 --> 11:20.785
That's "joincidence" with a "C"!

11:25.112 --> 11:28.586
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

11:34.802 --> 11:36.715
That had to hurt!

11:39.286 --> 11:41.199
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.646
Instead of watching football,
you could help.

11:43.811 --> 11:45.644
We know.

11:46.694 --> 11:49.769
Rachel, you want to put
the marshmallows in concentric circles.

11:49.937 --> 11:52.773
No, Mon. You want to put them
in concentric circles.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.331
I want to do this.

12:03.711 --> 12:05.829
Every year.

12:08.716 --> 12:10.674
It's stuck!

12:11.839 --> 12:13.068
Step.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.561
How did it get on?

12:14.722 --> 12:17.318
I put it on to scare Chandler.

12:17.484 --> 12:21.037
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!

12:21.208 --> 12:22.802
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

12:22.970 --> 12:27.844
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a turkey's ass.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.046
Monica.

12:33.661 --> 12:34.890
Did you get the turkey...?

12:35.062 --> 12:37.659
Oh, my God!

12:38.105 --> 12:39.620
Who is that?

12:39.787 --> 12:41.267
It's Joey.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.338
I got it!

12:43.511 --> 12:46.506
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

12:46.674 --> 12:48.553
That's interesting!

12:49.356 --> 12:50.677
If you win...

12:50.838 --> 12:52.477
...we give up the bird.

12:55.282 --> 12:57.195
But if we win...

12:57.364 --> 12:59.517
...we get your apartment.

13:02.369 --> 13:04.043
- Deal!
- What?

13:04.932 --> 13:07.608
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

13:07.775 --> 13:09.688
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct!

13:11.018 --> 13:13.090
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie."

13:13.260 --> 13:14.615
Dangerous Liaisons.

13:14.782 --> 13:17.298
- "Her actual favorite movie is...?"
- Weekend at Bernie's.

13:19.226 --> 13:23.143
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

13:23.310 --> 13:24.586
- Everyday use.
- Fancy.

13:24.752 --> 13:26.186
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

13:26.353 --> 13:28.186
- Two seconds.
- Eleven?

13:29.156 --> 13:31.388
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.121
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

13:36.283 --> 13:37.559
- 14?
- No, 19.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.239
Thanks, man.

13:39.406 --> 13:41.478
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

13:41.649 --> 13:43.447
- His name was...?"
- Maurice!

13:43.611 --> 13:45.729
- "His profession was...?"
- Space cowboy!

13:47.815 --> 13:49.933
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

13:54.742 --> 13:56.301
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

13:56.463 --> 13:59.060
Something to do
with transponding.

13:59.226 --> 14:02.107
He's a transponster!

14:02.269 --> 14:04.262
That's not even a word!

14:14.361 --> 14:18.244
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

14:18.405 --> 14:21.606
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

14:21.769 --> 14:24.205
That is not true!
She forced me!

14:24.371 --> 14:26.842
You got the question wrong.

14:27.014 --> 14:29.246
It was a stupid, unfair question!

14:29.416 --> 14:31.010
Don't blame the questions!

14:31.178 --> 14:36.382
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

14:36.864 --> 14:38.139
Chandler!

14:41.629 --> 14:43.826
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

14:43.991 --> 14:47.111
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

14:47.595 --> 14:50.316
Listen, we had a good run.

14:50.477 --> 14:52.675
What was it?
Four, five months?

14:52.840 --> 14:56.074
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.044
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

15:02.209 --> 15:06.001
What the hell are you doing?

15:06.173 --> 15:07.163
What's going on?

15:07.374 --> 15:11.291
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

15:12.139 --> 15:14.416
Dude, he's right there.

15:16.544 --> 15:19.458
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

15:19.627 --> 15:22.667
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

15:22.830 --> 15:26.462
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.387
I'm in love with her.

15:29.717 --> 15:32.233
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.041
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

15:42.369 --> 15:45.011
My best friend and my sister!

15:47.735 --> 15:50.012
I cannot believe this!

15:51.418 --> 15:53.138
This is the last box of your clothes.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.136
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

15:57.464 --> 16:00.983
I was gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

16:03.511 --> 16:06.107
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...

16:06.273 --> 16:08.631
...I don't want to live with
Rachel anymore.

16:09.276 --> 16:11.189
You're so mean to each other.

16:11.358 --> 16:14.513
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

16:15.002 --> 16:18.395
That's fine because I'm not moving.

16:18.566 --> 16:20.444
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

16:21.488 --> 16:23.128
I said some bad stuff...

16:23.290 --> 16:26.330
...but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

16:26.493 --> 16:31.447
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

16:31.619 --> 16:32.769
What else?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.299
When I take a shower...

16:36.463 --> 16:38.616
...she leaves me notes on the mirror.

16:38.786 --> 16:40.904
I do. I do do that.

16:41.108 --> 16:44.946
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

16:46.994 --> 16:49.511
When I fall asleep on the couch...

16:50.598 --> 16:52.591
...she covers me with a blanket.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.518
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

16:59.647 --> 17:02.722
And when I told her that I was gonna
move in with Chandler...

17:03.370 --> 17:05.328
...she was really supportive.

17:07.815 --> 17:09.614
You were so great.

17:10.578 --> 17:13.492
You made it so easy.

17:14.662 --> 17:17.178
And now you have to leave.

17:17.344 --> 17:19.907
And I have to live with a boy!

17:35.563 --> 17:38.558
- She really left.
- I know.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.962
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

17:51.699 --> 17:54.215
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

17:54.381 --> 17:56.978
What the hell is that dog doing here?

17:58.065 --> 17:59.898
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

18:00.548 --> 18:03.462
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned...

18:03.631 --> 18:07.183
...but for me this has
been really great.

18:07.354 --> 18:10.668
I think because it didn't
involve divorce...

18:10.838 --> 18:12.067
...or projectile vomiting.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.361
If you had gone to Vail...

18:16.524 --> 18:20.646
...or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have...

18:20.808 --> 18:22.401
...syphilis and stuff...

18:24.572 --> 18:26.450
...we wouldn't be
all together.

18:26.614 --> 18:28.607
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

18:28.776 --> 18:34.378
...that I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

18:35.102 --> 18:38.336
- That's so sweet!
- Thank you.

18:40.347 --> 18:42.499
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

18:42.670 --> 18:43.899
And a crappy New Year!

18:44.071 --> 18:46.428
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

18:52.119 --> 18:54.271
You can't move. You just...
You just can't.

18:54.441 --> 18:56.958
Rachel's right.
This is where you guys belong.

18:57.124 --> 19:00.518
You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.

19:01.769 --> 19:05.128
You know, sometimes when I'm alone
in my apartment, I look over here...

19:05.292 --> 19:08.492
...and you guys are just having dinner...

19:08.656 --> 19:11.456
...or watching TV or something...

19:12.099 --> 19:13.773
...but it makes me feel better.

19:13.941 --> 19:16.298
And now when I look over,
who am I gonna see?

19:16.463 --> 19:18.821
The Gottliebs? The Yangs?

19:19.466 --> 19:21.505
They don't make me feel so good.

19:22.750 --> 19:26.872
Yeah. So don't move, okay?
Just stay here...

19:27.034 --> 19:29.152
...and maybe close your blinds at night.
- Hey.

19:35.282 --> 19:36.922
Hello?

19:39.486 --> 19:41.639
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.

19:41.809 --> 19:43.084
And?

19:45.613 --> 19:47.411
Okay. Thanks.

19:49.577 --> 19:50.852
They passed.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.216
They said they won't go a penny
under the asking price.

19:55.382 --> 19:58.104
- We can't afford that.
- I know.

20:00.107 --> 20:01.588
Well, there you go.

20:06.233 --> 20:07.873
I'm really sorry, you guys.

20:08.035 --> 20:11.474
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry
that phone call didn't come...

20:11.639 --> 20:14.075
...before I told you about looking
through the window.

20:15.402 --> 20:17.440
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
let you be alone.

20:17.605 --> 20:19.437
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, we'll be okay.

20:19.607 --> 20:20.882
Love you guys.

20:23.370 --> 20:26.092
You know, I'm really sorry
I wasn't more supportive before.

20:26.253 --> 20:27.734
That's okay. We understand.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.649
Yeah, and about this Nancy...

20:29.817 --> 20:31.810
If you're not sleeping with her, should I?

20:38.345 --> 20:40.816
I know there'll be other houses,
but I just...

20:40.988 --> 20:43.869
- I love that one so much.
- Yeah.

20:44.552 --> 20:46.749
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.

20:48.155 --> 20:50.273
- What?
- We got the house.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.879
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.601
We got it?! We got the house?!

20:55.763 --> 20:57.322
We're getting a house!

21:01.408 --> 21:04.084
- We're getting a house.
- And a baby.

21:04.251 --> 21:05.572
We're growing up.

21:06.854 --> 21:08.368
We sure are.

21:09.256 --> 21:10.691
- Who's gonna tell them?
- Not it!

21:10.858 --> 21:12.657
Not it! Damn it!

21:17.224 --> 21:18.818
Rachel, this is yours.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.501
Why? What are these for?

21:20.668 --> 21:23.423
- You'll see.
- All right, everybody open them.

21:25.753 --> 21:28.428
Wow, this is so beautiful!

21:28.596 --> 21:30.828
These are the ones
I was looking at in the store!

21:30.998 --> 21:32.877
- I know.
- Oh, I love this!

21:33.040 --> 21:34.760
A meatball sub!

21:35.563 --> 21:36.838
Thanks!

21:37.004 --> 21:39.521
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?

21:39.687 --> 21:42.568
Well, I didn't know
how to tell you before...

21:42.730 --> 21:44.768
...but we got the house.
- Enjoy!

21:49.577 --> 21:50.806
What did they say?

21:50.978 --> 21:52.698
