WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.158


00:02.021 --> 00:05.752
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you...

00:05.925 --> 00:09.656
...has slept with
who of the six of you?

00:10.830 --> 00:13.162
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

00:14.467 --> 00:17.664
I'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

00:17.904 --> 00:20.099
Yeah. You know what?
If that doesn't change soon...

00:20.273 --> 00:22.833
...I'm going to dump you
for somebody who puts out.

00:23.009 --> 00:26.638
Come on. Over the years, none of you
ever got, you know, drunk and stupid?

00:26.813 --> 00:29.475
Well, that's really
a different question.

00:30.316 --> 00:33.251
I find it hard to believe
that a group of people who spends...

00:33.419 --> 00:37.150
...as much time together as you
guys do has never bumped uglies.

00:38.758 --> 00:41.784
Well, there was that one time
that Monica and Rachel got together.

00:42.262 --> 00:43.729
- What?
- What?

00:44.163 --> 00:46.529
Excuse me, there was no time.

00:46.699 --> 00:49.259
Okay, but let's say there was.

00:49.435 --> 00:51.198
How might that go?

00:52.705 --> 00:55.606
Okay. Okay.
Well, then answer me this:

00:55.875 --> 00:59.868
Have any of you ever almost?

01:02.982 --> 01:06.543
- Anybody need more coffee?
- Hey, there's a dog out there!

01:07.220 --> 01:09.518
The One With the Flashback

01:55.301 --> 01:57.929
- That is so unfortunate.
- What?

01:58.104 --> 02:00.732
Cute Naked Guy's really
starting to put on weight.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.309
I'll be back in just a minute.

02:04.544 --> 02:08.947
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry that I left
lipstick marks on the phone.

02:09.115 --> 02:11.606
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

02:11.851 --> 02:14.615
Then it must have been you. Bye.

02:15.788 --> 02:16.777
Bye-bye.

02:18.291 --> 02:21.192
- That's why I moved out.
- Hey, while we're on that...

02:21.361 --> 02:24.956
...when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

02:25.465 --> 02:27.365
I think on some level,
she already knows.

02:27.633 --> 02:30.124
She doesn't know that
you sneak out every night.

02:30.336 --> 02:32.065
She doesn't know
that you sneak back...

02:32.305 --> 02:35.502
...and she doesn't know you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

02:35.742 --> 02:37.733
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

02:38.411 --> 02:39.878
You have got to tell her.

02:40.046 --> 02:42.571
The longer you wait,
the harder it is going to be on her.

02:42.749 --> 02:45.149
You're right. You're right.

02:45.318 --> 02:47.513
Anyway, listen, tonight's bag...

02:47.687 --> 02:50.121
...is really bulky.
So could you sneak stuff out for me?

02:50.289 --> 02:52.780
It's just like a clock radio
and some cemetery dirt.

02:55.128 --> 02:57.323
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:00.099 --> 03:02.727
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

03:02.902 --> 03:03.891
Nobody good?

03:04.070 --> 03:06.630
Well, let's see.
There was the guy with the ferrets.

03:06.806 --> 03:07.795
That's plural.

03:09.142 --> 03:12.669
The spitter. And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much...

03:12.945 --> 03:15.641
...he felt the need to make
a noise every time he said it.

03:15.815 --> 03:18.477
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

03:18.785 --> 03:22.152
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

03:22.321 --> 03:24.312
- How many more do you have tomorrow?
- Two.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.788
This photographer
who seemed really dull...

03:26.959 --> 03:30.360
...and this actor guy who
I'm not sure about because...

03:30.530 --> 03:32.498
...when I answered the phone
"Chandler Bing"...

03:32.698 --> 03:35.189
...he said, "Whoa! Short message!"

03:38.004 --> 03:40.632
Foot on the floor
or come over no more.

03:41.741 --> 03:44.733
Sure, your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

03:45.378 --> 03:46.970
- What?
- I have to go.

03:49.715 --> 03:52.149
Carol should be home by now, so...

03:52.418 --> 03:55.080
- How's it going with you guys?
- Better, actually.

03:55.254 --> 03:58.587
I think I finally figured out why we
were having so much trouble lately.

03:58.758 --> 04:01.283
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

04:01.527 --> 04:04.087
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

04:04.263 --> 04:08.962
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, Susan something.

04:09.335 --> 04:13.897
And they really hit it off, and
I think it's gonna make a difference.

04:16.876 --> 04:18.138
So, Eric...

04:18.377 --> 04:20.470
...what kind of photography do you do?

04:20.680 --> 04:22.170
Oh, mostly fashion.

04:22.415 --> 04:25.282
So there may be models here
sometimes. I hope that's cool.

04:27.487 --> 04:28.954
Yes, that is cool.

04:29.655 --> 04:32.089
Because I have models here,
you know...

04:33.359 --> 04:35.384
...never.

04:35.561 --> 04:37.051
What else?

04:37.230 --> 04:40.666
During the summer I spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house...

04:40.833 --> 04:42.528
...which you are welcome to use.

04:42.802 --> 04:46.294
Although I should probably tell you,
she's a porn star.

04:48.774 --> 04:51.675
Well, listen, I still have
one more person to meet...

04:51.878 --> 04:54.813
...but unless it turns out
to be your sister...

04:55.381 --> 04:57.679
...I think your chances
are pretty good.

04:58.384 --> 04:59.544
All right.

05:03.990 --> 05:05.821
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

05:06.025 --> 05:09.984
This right here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

05:10.696 --> 05:13.187
Don't you wanna
ask me any questions?

05:15.501 --> 05:17.128
Sure.

05:18.671 --> 05:20.764
What's up?

05:21.140 --> 05:23.665
Well, I'm an actor.

05:23.843 --> 05:25.071
I'm fairly neat.

05:26.212 --> 05:28.112
I got my own TV.

05:28.281 --> 05:31.876
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

05:34.754 --> 05:36.051
What gay thing?

05:36.889 --> 05:41.917
Just, you know, in general.
The whole people being gay thing.

05:43.329 --> 05:44.819
Totally cool with that.

05:48.534 --> 05:51.094
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.804
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:59.345 --> 06:00.437
Oh, my God!

06:09.088 --> 06:10.180
Hey, Mon.

06:11.190 --> 06:14.626
- Wanna hear something that sucks?
- Do I ever!

06:15.795 --> 06:18.593
- Chris says they're closing down the bar.
- No way!

06:18.764 --> 06:21.028
Apparently, they're turning
it into a coffee place.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.531
Just coffee?

06:23.236 --> 06:26.034
- Where are we gonna hang out now?
- You got me.

06:26.205 --> 06:28.730
- Can I get a beer, please?
- Hey, did you pick a roommate?

06:28.941 --> 06:30.909
- You betcha.
- Is it the Italian guy?

06:31.410 --> 06:32.399
Yeah, right.

06:34.113 --> 06:35.102
He's so cute.

06:35.281 --> 06:37.977
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with...

06:38.184 --> 06:40.516
...and be referred to as the funny one.

06:41.153 --> 06:43.553
Pool table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

06:43.723 --> 06:45.953
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

06:46.158 --> 06:49.286
Okay, but after that,
we're shooting some pool.

06:51.030 --> 06:54.466
No, no, no, no.
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

06:55.601 --> 06:57.865
My friend ordered an onion...

06:58.137 --> 06:59.934
...not an olive.

07:00.139 --> 07:03.040
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke...

07:03.276 --> 07:05.471
...which I don't think this is.

07:05.878 --> 07:08.938
- I am so sorry.
- That's all right.

07:09.348 --> 07:12.476
I mean, how hard is it to get
a couple drinks right, huh?

07:16.289 --> 07:18.348
I would like to propose a toast...

07:18.991 --> 07:22.051
...to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become...

07:22.328 --> 07:25.525
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

07:26.198 --> 07:29.224
I think it's time
to see the ring again.

07:33.172 --> 07:38.235
Isn't it exciting? I mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life.

07:41.013 --> 07:43.311
Yeah. I know.

07:44.150 --> 07:45.310
What?

07:45.484 --> 07:47.509
Oh, I don't know.

07:48.187 --> 07:51.179
Well, maybe it's just the idea...

07:51.424 --> 07:53.984
...of Barry for the rest of my life.

07:54.193 --> 07:57.822
I don't know, I think I...
I feel like I need to have one last fling...

07:58.097 --> 08:01.032
...you know, just to sort of get it
out of my system.

08:03.336 --> 08:05.998
- Rachel, stop!
- You're so bad!

08:06.172 --> 08:09.903
I'm serious. I really think
I need to just have...

08:10.176 --> 08:12.269
...some meaningless sex,
you know?

08:12.511 --> 08:15.241
With the next guy I see.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.012
Excuse me, I seem to have
dropped my ball.

08:27.059 --> 08:28.083
Yeah, so?

08:30.796 --> 08:33.128
And now I've picked it up again.

08:36.469 --> 08:39.302
My God!
I went to high school with her.

08:39.472 --> 08:40.962
Rachel!

08:41.140 --> 08:42.539
Hi!

08:42.708 --> 08:45.006
Monica!

08:47.113 --> 08:48.978
Is she giving me the finger?

08:49.482 --> 08:50.881
Monica!

08:51.050 --> 08:53.541
Look! Hi! What do you think?

08:53.819 --> 08:55.047
Oh, my God!

08:55.321 --> 08:57.983
You can't even see
where the Titanic hit it.

08:58.557 --> 09:02.493
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

09:02.661 --> 09:04.959
Just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

09:05.131 --> 09:08.999
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

09:09.168 --> 09:10.533
Not right now.

09:10.936 --> 09:12.528
Oh, well, that's okay.

09:13.806 --> 09:14.795
I know.

09:19.412 --> 09:21.744
So I think I'll get back
to my friend.

09:21.914 --> 09:24.280
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

09:28.087 --> 09:31.284
Listen, can we please have lunch
the next time I'm in the city?

09:31.457 --> 09:32.617
That'd be great.

09:32.792 --> 09:33.781
- Okay.
- Thanks.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.654
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:36.095 --> 09:39.895
Ten bucks says I never see
that woman again in my life.

09:40.566 --> 09:43.000
No, honey, really. It's fine.

09:43.169 --> 09:44.500
Just...

09:44.670 --> 09:45.762
Go with Susan.

09:45.971 --> 09:47.131
Really, I think...

09:47.873 --> 09:50.433
I think girls' night out
is a great idea.

09:52.411 --> 09:54.174
Okay. Okay. Bye.

09:54.613 --> 09:57.980
- So, what are they doing?
- I don't know. Something girly.

10:01.821 --> 10:03.118
Hey, you're early.

10:03.389 --> 10:05.289
What are you doing with the lamp?

10:05.791 --> 10:07.759
I'm just taking it to get rewired.

10:09.562 --> 10:14.329
Don't take it to the place you took the
stereo. They've had that for over a week.

10:22.374 --> 10:25.309
No! Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

10:25.778 --> 10:28.212
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.713
- You don't play the oboe.
- I could play the oboe.

10:32.618 --> 10:35.917
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

10:40.793 --> 10:41.851
Who are you?

10:42.294 --> 10:44.353
I'm Eric, I'm gonna be
Chandler's new roommate.

10:44.530 --> 10:45.895
I'm Chandler's new roommate.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.768
- I don't think so.
- I could be Chandler's new roommate.

10:51.504 --> 10:54.405
- But he told me over the phone...
- He told me in person.

10:55.674 --> 10:56.732
That's weird.

10:56.909 --> 11:00.106
Well, I'm going to go into
my new apartment now.

11:20.165 --> 11:21.393
Hi, again.

11:22.234 --> 11:23.258
Hey.

11:28.207 --> 11:29.196
Hey.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.842
Thank you so much.

11:31.076 --> 11:34.409
No, no, no. Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that didn't show up.

11:34.647 --> 11:36.547
Okay, I gotta get to work.

11:36.715 --> 11:39.445
And not just for the money.
But because every now and then...

11:39.618 --> 11:43.748
...someone walks out of the bathroom with
a little bit of toilet paper on their shoe.

11:48.294 --> 11:51.388
- You need some help with that?
- No, thanks. I got it.

11:51.564 --> 11:53.225
No. No, I don't!

11:53.399 --> 11:54.661
Okay?

11:57.436 --> 11:59.927
Stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

12:00.839 --> 12:02.272
It's the heat.

12:05.611 --> 12:07.272
And the humidity.

12:09.715 --> 12:11.012
That's a...

12:11.216 --> 12:13.047
That's a tough combination.

12:17.523 --> 12:19.957
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

12:20.459 --> 12:23.394
Like you wouldn't believe.

12:29.201 --> 12:30.896
This is a great place.

12:32.204 --> 12:33.228
Thank you.

12:34.206 --> 12:36.572
Just make yourself comfortable.

12:37.409 --> 12:38.774
Gotcha.

12:41.313 --> 12:44.339
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

12:47.586 --> 12:49.577
I got it from her
when she moved to Florida.

12:49.755 --> 12:52.986
Otherwise I could never
afford a place like this.

12:56.895 --> 12:58.522
So if the landlord ever asks...

12:58.764 --> 13:02.461
...I'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?

13:02.635 --> 13:04.762
You bet I am!

13:06.271 --> 13:07.260
Okay...

13:07.439 --> 13:08.838
...here's your penis!

13:12.211 --> 13:15.374
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

13:15.547 --> 13:17.811
You said, "You wanna come
in for some lemonade?"

13:17.983 --> 13:19.348
So?

13:21.453 --> 13:23.421
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

13:24.890 --> 13:25.948
Cover yourself up!

13:26.425 --> 13:27.619
Oh, right. Sorry.

13:27.826 --> 13:29.384
God, I don't believe this!

13:29.595 --> 13:33.361
Someone asks you in for lemonade and to
you that means they want to have sex?

13:33.565 --> 13:36.500
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade.

13:36.702 --> 13:38.966
Iced tea, sometimes juice.

13:40.739 --> 13:42.900
Look, sorry. I just...

13:43.609 --> 13:44.871
I thought you liked me.

13:45.110 --> 13:46.941
I'm such a jerk.

13:49.181 --> 13:50.205
It's okay.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.949
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

13:54.186 --> 13:55.915
Not anyone I know, but...

13:58.891 --> 14:01.257
By the way, I can still see it.

14:12.805 --> 14:14.170
- Pheebs?
- Huh?

14:14.339 --> 14:15.499
Where's your bed?

14:18.644 --> 14:20.908
It's not in the apartment?

14:22.981 --> 14:25.108
Oh, no.

14:26.552 --> 14:29.077
I can't believe this
is happening again.

14:30.155 --> 14:33.647
- What?
- Okay, enough with the third degree!

14:35.561 --> 14:37.961
I don't live here anymore.

14:38.497 --> 14:41.591
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

14:41.834 --> 14:44.860
I don't live here anymore.

14:46.638 --> 14:50.734
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

14:53.078 --> 14:55.239
Everybody knows?

14:55.514 --> 14:58.915
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.

14:59.318 --> 15:02.014
I don't understand.
I thought we were doing better lately.

15:02.187 --> 15:04.212
Yeah, 'cause I moved out.

15:06.258 --> 15:07.384
Monica, I...

15:07.559 --> 15:10.323
Do you know, okay, I couldn't
sleep for, like, a month...

15:10.496 --> 15:13.795
...because I got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

15:14.433 --> 15:16.663
Well, you could've just
turned the cushion over.

15:16.835 --> 15:19.895
I would have, except I had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

15:20.239 --> 15:21.228
What?

15:21.406 --> 15:23.340
Okay. This is what I'm talking about.

15:23.609 --> 15:27.101
I need to live in a land
where people can spill!

15:28.213 --> 15:29.840
Well, you can spill.

15:30.482 --> 15:31.813
In the sink.

15:32.651 --> 15:36.883
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

15:37.122 --> 15:40.114
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.

15:40.325 --> 15:43.021
And if I keep living here,
I don't see that happening.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.564
- I love you too.
- Oh, good.

15:50.903 --> 15:52.564
What?

15:53.605 --> 15:55.232
What? I'm just sad.

15:55.974 --> 15:58.636
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

16:00.212 --> 16:03.670
Well, why can't I think of both?
I mean, I can think two things.

16:04.316 --> 16:07.479
Go ahead. Look.
You know you want to. Go.

16:08.754 --> 16:10.517
Oh, my God!

16:16.862 --> 16:20.559
- So, what are you watching?
- Baywatch.

16:22.634 --> 16:24.329
What's it about?

16:25.871 --> 16:27.338
Lifeguards.

16:28.073 --> 16:30.667
Well, it sounds kind of stup...

16:31.210 --> 16:32.199
Who's she?

16:33.712 --> 16:34.974
Nicole Eggert.

16:35.581 --> 16:37.071
We like her.

16:43.055 --> 16:44.784
Wow! Look at them run!

16:47.092 --> 16:48.559
They do that a lot.

16:51.630 --> 16:52.927
Hey, you want a beer?

16:53.098 --> 16:56.397
- Yeah, I'll go get one.
- Don't get up. I got a cooler right here.

17:01.106 --> 17:02.505
- Hello!
- Hey.

17:02.774 --> 17:05.208
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

17:05.410 --> 17:07.344
Help yourself.

17:07.913 --> 17:09.278
You okay?

17:11.884 --> 17:13.317
Phoebe moved out.

17:15.854 --> 17:17.344
Right.

17:17.623 --> 17:19.557
I don't understand.

17:19.791 --> 17:24.387
Am I so hard to live with?
Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

17:24.563 --> 17:25.689
No!

17:25.864 --> 17:28.992
You don't have a boyfriend because...

17:30.302 --> 17:33.465
I don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

17:34.339 --> 17:36.170
You should have a boyfriend.

17:37.142 --> 17:39.201
Well, I think so.

17:41.013 --> 17:42.037
Come here.

17:42.281 --> 17:43.305
Come here.

17:45.951 --> 17:49.182
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people...

17:49.388 --> 17:53.552
...and the most beautiful woman
I've ever known in real life.

18:07.506 --> 18:09.371
Hi.

18:11.043 --> 18:12.738
Where is everybody?

18:12.911 --> 18:17.007
Oh, it's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

18:17.215 --> 18:20.378
I think my marriage...

18:20.552 --> 18:21.746
...is kind of over.

18:22.254 --> 18:24.051
Oh, no! Why?

18:24.222 --> 18:26.417
Because Carol's a lesbian.

18:29.761 --> 18:30.750
And...

18:30.929 --> 18:32.453
And I'm not one.

18:36.468 --> 18:39.403
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

18:40.005 --> 18:41.632
Oh, my God!

18:43.008 --> 18:44.532
I don't believe it!

18:45.644 --> 18:47.544
Oh, you poor bunny.

18:49.281 --> 18:50.441
I'm an idiot.

18:51.350 --> 18:53.250
I mean, I should have seen it.

18:53.418 --> 18:58.617
I mean, Carol and I would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman...

18:58.790 --> 19:01.850
...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"

19:02.060 --> 19:07.020
And I'd think, "God, my wife is cool."

19:13.572 --> 19:16.006
Hey, do you think
that Susan person is her lover?

19:19.578 --> 19:21.569
Well, now I do!

19:23.348 --> 19:25.316
I'm sorry.

19:27.019 --> 19:29.317
Seven years!

19:29.488 --> 19:32.685
I mean, we've been together
seven years.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.987
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

19:36.261 --> 19:38.821
She's the only woman I've ever...

19:39.698 --> 19:42.292
Oh, Ross.

19:45.971 --> 19:47.563
This is nice.

19:47.806 --> 19:49.467
I know. It is, isn't it?

19:51.276 --> 19:55.269
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.

19:56.581 --> 19:59.243
Is it a hundred percent cotton?

20:02.721 --> 20:05.815
Yeah.
And I got it on sale too.

20:06.158 --> 20:08.888
I mean, it looks nubby, but...

20:09.061 --> 20:11.586
But it's not.

20:12.831 --> 20:13.820
Anyway, I should go.

20:13.999 --> 20:18.231
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

20:18.937 --> 20:21.405
If you want to get
a drink later, we can.

20:21.573 --> 20:23.063
That sounds great.

20:23.809 --> 20:27.870
- Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...
- I know.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.206
Thanks.

20:33.485 --> 20:37.854
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if I'd been more nurturing...

20:38.023 --> 20:41.754
...or I'd paid more attention...

20:41.927 --> 20:44.521
...or I had a uterus.

20:45.630 --> 20:47.427
- I can't believe it.
- I know.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.999
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross. You're really...

20:51.203 --> 20:52.966
- You're so good.
- Thanks.

20:53.205 --> 20:54.934
And you're so sweet.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.631
- Thanks.
- And you're kind.

20:57.843 --> 20:59.105
Thanks.

21:10.455 --> 21:12.286
Come here.

21:13.225 --> 21:14.852
Wait, wait, wait.

21:19.731 --> 21:21.722
Okay. It's okay.

21:27.539 --> 21:30.133
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

21:30.308 --> 21:32.071
What?

21:32.244 --> 21:34.109
- What?
- I can't get it out.

21:34.279 --> 21:37.077
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

21:37.249 --> 21:39.717
Come on, don't start.

21:40.819 --> 21:44.778
- What?
- Stupid balls are in the way.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.099
Oh, well.

22:05.410 --> 22:09.813
That probably wouldn't have been
the most constructive solution.

22:10.448 --> 22:12.348
You have chalk on your face.

22:13.718 --> 22:17.882
Oh, Ross, you're right. I don't know why
I always thought this was real grass.

22:25.063 --> 22:26.462
Honey, you okay?

22:27.766 --> 22:29.791
My wife's a lesbian.

22:30.302 --> 22:32.634
Cool!

22:35.574 --> 22:37.906
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

22:38.076 --> 22:40.670
- Hey.
- How's it going?

22:46.818 --> 22:49.582
I can't believe you came back.

22:49.754 --> 22:52.120
Don't say anything.

22:52.290 --> 22:55.418
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.

22:55.594 --> 23:00.395
I just want you to take me and kiss me
and make love to me right here...

23:00.599 --> 23:02.692
...right now.

23:10.475 --> 23:11.999
Rachel.

23:12.177 --> 23:13.542
Rachel!

23:13.712 --> 23:16.272
- What?
- You missed the exit.

23:17.382 --> 23:22.149
- Oh. Sorry.
- My God, what were you thinking about?

23:24.589 --> 23:26.523
Barry.

23:35.166 --> 23:35.500
