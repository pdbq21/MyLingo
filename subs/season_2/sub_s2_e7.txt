WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:06.029
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

00:06.272 --> 00:09.537
Is there something
repellent about me?

00:09.477 --> 00:10.341
How was the party?

00:10.644 --> 00:14.045
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.477
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

00:17.951 --> 00:20.681
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.615
I go through the same thing.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.984
When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.658
I've put on weight?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.934
Did you want to...?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.370
No, not weight.
More like insulation.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.773
I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.672
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

00:47.147 --> 00:51.277
I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.383
Please?

00:52.619 --> 00:54.712
Come on, let her do it!

00:54.955 --> 00:55.785
All right.

00:55.989 --> 01:00.153
If we put on spandex and my boobs
are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.820
Your boobs are fine.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.552
I shouldn't have said anything.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.822
Come here. Come here!

01:08.235 --> 01:10.499
Can't make hands meet!

01:13.207 --> 01:15.300
The One Where Ross Finds Out

02:08.090 --> 02:09.182
Let's do it!

02:14.229 --> 02:15.059
What?

02:15.564 --> 02:19.000
Nothing. Just never seen
your little stretchy pants before.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.836
It's cute!

02:23.836 --> 02:25.701
And we're changing.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.610
Come on, give me five more!

02:42.888 --> 02:43.752
Five more!

02:46.192 --> 02:47.750
Five more and I'll flash you.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.450
One...

02:50.930 --> 02:52.192
...two...

02:53.399 --> 02:55.128
...two and a half.

02:57.703 --> 02:58.897
Just show me one of them.

03:15.821 --> 03:16.810
She's insane!

03:17.056 --> 03:18.114
The woman is insane.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.952
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.425
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

03:24.630 --> 03:27.622
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

03:27.622 --> 03:29.622
Just tell her you want to stop.

03:29.622 --> 03:32.622
I can't. All she get to work is all she can got.

03:32.622 --> 03:37.068
So that's why we think maybe we should all picking and buy her own resterant.

03:38.568 --> 03:40.468
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?

03:40.737 --> 03:43.934
It was nice. Took him
to a romantic restaurant...

03:44.173 --> 03:46.073
...ordered champagne. Nice.

03:46.776 --> 03:48.004
He still won't put out?

03:48.311 --> 03:50.074
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

03:50.913 --> 03:52.437
Sorry, Pheebs.

03:53.249 --> 03:55.114
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

03:55.351 --> 03:56.579
I like him a lot.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.879
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

04:00.089 --> 04:01.989
Why won't he give it up?

04:03.192 --> 04:06.355
Maybe he drives his car
on the other side of the road.

04:06.629 --> 04:08.426
If you know what I mean.

04:09.665 --> 04:12.429
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

04:15.471 --> 04:16.995
Maybe he's gay.

04:19.542 --> 04:21.533
I don't think that's the problem.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.675
We went dancing
the other night...

04:23.880 --> 04:28.112
...and just the way he held me so close
and looked into my eyes....

04:28.317 --> 04:30.785
I just definitely felt something.

04:31.054 --> 04:33.386
But how much can you
tell from a look?

04:33.623 --> 04:35.523
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

04:39.228 --> 04:41.696
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.357
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

04:48.638 --> 04:50.071
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

04:50.306 --> 04:51.238
What?

04:53.342 --> 04:55.833
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

04:56.679 --> 04:57.509
You have a date?

04:57.814 --> 04:59.645
Monica's setting me up.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.574
What about Ross and....

05:02.819 --> 05:05.151
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

05:05.354 --> 05:07.879
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

05:08.157 --> 05:10.318
... I've decided to opt for sanity.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.550
You're okay about all this?

05:12.829 --> 05:14.990
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

05:15.431 --> 05:18.889
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

05:19.168 --> 05:22.865
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

05:24.540 --> 05:25.837
Hi, guys.

05:26.075 --> 05:30.171
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

05:30.713 --> 05:32.078
If you say his full name.

05:33.182 --> 05:38.051
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

05:39.689 --> 05:40.587
All right.

05:40.790 --> 05:44.556
-You're getting a cat?
-Actually, we're getting a cat.

05:45.361 --> 05:46.692
Together?

05:46.929 --> 05:48.920
Both of you? Together?

05:49.232 --> 05:52.690
It'll live with Ross half the time
and with me half the time.

05:53.202 --> 05:56.035
Well, isn't that just lovely?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.131
That's something you'll enjoy...

05:59.408 --> 06:01.899
...for a really, really,
really long time.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.578
Hopefully.

06:04.046 --> 06:07.243
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

06:07.450 --> 06:08.940
With a man.

06:10.052 --> 06:12.282
You guys have a really good night...

06:12.555 --> 06:16.491
...and you two have a really good cat.

06:20.763 --> 06:23.254
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

06:30.239 --> 06:35.267
I don't know if Monica told you, but
this my first date since my divorce.

06:35.678 --> 06:37.578
If I seem a little nervous...

06:37.813 --> 06:38.905
... I am.

06:39.916 --> 06:41.315
How long do cats live?

06:43.252 --> 06:44.082
I'm sorry?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.311
Cats. How long do they live?

06:46.622 --> 06:49.455
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.758
Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.294
Well, that's just great.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.197
Cheers!

06:59.468 --> 07:01.095
Right. Clink.

07:07.777 --> 07:10.541
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

07:12.215 --> 07:16.049
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just....

07:16.819 --> 07:18.184
It's this thing.

07:18.454 --> 07:20.217
It's not as bad as it sounds...

07:20.456 --> 07:24.153
... but this friend of mine is
getting a cat with his girlfriend.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.328
Oh, that does sound....

07:29.498 --> 07:31.864
He just started going out with her.

07:32.868 --> 07:35.530
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

07:38.307 --> 07:39.638
Yeah, he wishes.

07:42.878 --> 07:44.743
I'm sorry. Look at me.

07:44.981 --> 07:47.381
Michael, let's talk about you.

07:51.053 --> 07:51.985
So....

07:54.857 --> 07:57.382
Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

07:59.161 --> 08:01.994
-So I figured it out.
-What?

08:02.231 --> 08:04.392
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.031
I'm not sexy enough.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.534
Phoebe, that's crazy.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.435
When I first met you,
you know what I said?

08:12.675 --> 08:15.735
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

08:18.914 --> 08:20.575
Really? That's so sweet.

08:23.185 --> 08:26.848
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

08:28.024 --> 08:31.721
If you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.529
You're right. You're right.

08:34.930 --> 08:36.397
You are so "yum"!

08:56.652 --> 09:00.588
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

09:02.158 --> 09:05.457
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.

09:05.661 --> 09:07.788
Those things that live for a day.

09:08.064 --> 09:09.964
What are they called?

09:10.933 --> 09:11.797
Fruit flies?

09:13.769 --> 09:14.633
Thank you.

09:14.904 --> 09:17.065
Would you like dessert?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.470
No dessert.

09:18.774 --> 09:20.969
Just the check. Please.

09:21.977 --> 09:24.810
Oh, no. You're not
having fun, are you?

09:25.081 --> 09:26.639
No, no, I am.

09:26.916 --> 09:31.649
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

09:33.456 --> 09:34.787
Oh, look at me.

09:35.257 --> 09:36.349
Look at me.

09:36.592 --> 09:40.153
I'm on a date
with a really great guy.

09:40.429 --> 09:42.659
All I can think about is Ross...

09:42.932 --> 09:44.832
...and his cat...

09:45.034 --> 09:46.467
...and his Julie.

09:48.467 --> 09:51.467
Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?

09:54.467 --> 09:58.467
Do like that man, I just screwed this all over.

09:58.603 --> 10:02.130
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

10:04.008 --> 10:07.876
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

10:08.113 --> 10:10.809
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure

10:12.150 --> 10:13.777
Closure!

10:14.185 --> 10:16.210
That's what it is!
That's what I need!

10:16.488 --> 10:18.319
God, you're brilliant!

10:20.392 --> 10:22.690
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

10:24.629 --> 10:28.531
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just....

10:28.800 --> 10:31.860
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

10:32.070 --> 10:33.196
"I'm over you."

10:34.706 --> 10:36.071
Over you.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.204
That's what it is.

10:39.144 --> 10:39.974
Closure.

10:41.646 --> 10:43.477
Hello? Excuse me?

10:44.349 --> 10:46.078
Excuse me. Hel

10:46.918 --> 10:48.112
-Hang on.
-Excuse me?

10:48.319 --> 10:50.014
-What?
-Hi. I'm sorry.

10:50.221 --> 10:53.554
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

10:54.559 --> 10:55.890
-I'm talking.
-I see that.

10:56.161 --> 11:00.860
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.724
You're being a little weird
about your phone.

11:05.406 --> 11:07.237
All right. Fine.

11:07.508 --> 11:09.533
I'll call you back.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.077
Thank you.

11:13.077 --> 11:18.077
So good people!

11:23.055 --> 11:24.522
Machine.

11:25.057 --> 11:27.787
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.

11:29.028 --> 11:32.429
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

11:32.698 --> 11:35.258
I'm just calling to say that...

11:35.468 --> 11:36.730
...everything's fine.

11:37.269 --> 11:39.203
And I'm really happy for you...

11:39.572 --> 11:41.563
...and your cat.

11:42.107 --> 11:46.100
Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

11:48.948 --> 11:51.382
You see there,
I'm thinking of names...

11:51.617 --> 11:54.950
...so obviously I am over you.

11:55.221 --> 11:58.281
I am over you.

11:58.557 --> 12:03.494
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

12:21.843 --> 12:24.368
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.341
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!

12:28.350 --> 12:30.215
It's God's day.

12:31.786 --> 12:34.050
If you say stop, then we stop.

12:35.690 --> 12:36.622
Stop.

12:36.858 --> 12:38.826
No, come on! We can't stop!

12:39.027 --> 12:40.961
We got three more pounds to go!

12:41.162 --> 12:44.188
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

13:03.752 --> 13:05.879
And how was the date?

13:06.221 --> 13:08.849
I think there was a restaurant.

13:09.324 --> 13:10.916
I know there was wine.

13:14.362 --> 13:16.193
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

13:16.431 --> 13:19.594
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....

13:19.834 --> 13:22.428
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

13:23.004 --> 13:25.063
I'm sorry. I don't know, l....

13:25.607 --> 13:27.905
I feel like I dreamed
about you last night...

13:28.176 --> 13:29.438
... but I don't remember.

13:34.282 --> 13:36.341
There they are.

13:37.052 --> 13:39.282
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

13:39.554 --> 13:41.920
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

13:43.725 --> 13:47.559
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

13:47.762 --> 13:49.525
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

13:53.301 --> 13:55.360
Rach, I got a message from you!

14:00.308 --> 14:01.434
Who's Michael?

14:01.710 --> 14:02.870
Oh, my God!

14:03.111 --> 14:06.205
Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

14:08.583 --> 14:09.914
Give me the

14:15.890 --> 14:17.619
You're over me?

14:17.926 --> 14:20.121
Oh, God!

14:20.428 --> 14:22.419
-You're
-Oh, God.

14:22.631 --> 14:23.495
You're over me?

14:30.405 --> 14:32.305
When were you...

14:32.507 --> 14:34.099
... under me?

14:39.814 --> 14:41.338
Rachel, do you...?

14:42.083 --> 14:43.846
I mean, were you?

14:44.319 --> 14:45.581
What?

14:48.590 --> 14:49.989
Basically...

14:50.258 --> 14:52.453
...Iately, I've....

14:53.962 --> 14:57.022
I've sort of had feelings for you.

15:00.669 --> 15:03.763
You've had feelings for me?

15:04.005 --> 15:06.030
So? You had feelings for me first!

15:10.178 --> 15:12.442
You know about my
You know I had

15:12.647 --> 15:14.547
You know?

15:16.751 --> 15:17.615
Chandler told me.

15:18.019 --> 15:20.487
When did he? When did he?
When did he?

15:23.157 --> 15:24.215
When you were in China.

15:25.126 --> 15:25.956
Meeting Julie.

15:27.228 --> 15:30.129
Julie. That's
Oh, God!

15:32.733 --> 15:33.961
I need to lie down.

15:35.403 --> 15:36.700
No, I'm gonna stand.

15:36.904 --> 15:38.531
I'm gonna stand...

15:38.806 --> 15:42.572
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.707
Now you're over me?

15:50.251 --> 15:51.980
Are you over me?

16:01.929 --> 16:03.863
That's Julie.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.425
-Hi, Julie.
-I've got a cab waiting.

16:08.669 --> 16:10.534
I'll be right down!

16:14.675 --> 16:16.006
Wait, so you're going?

16:16.277 --> 16:19.906
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

16:20.181 --> 16:22.376
I mean, I've
You know, I've got a cab.

16:22.583 --> 16:25.848
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

16:30.191 --> 16:31.215
Cat!

16:48.276 --> 16:50.267
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

16:52.113 --> 16:55.139
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

16:56.651 --> 16:58.710
I can't find the remote.

17:02.156 --> 17:03.487
Thank you.

17:04.925 --> 17:07.450
Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

17:07.728 --> 17:10.492
-And?
-And we did.

17:10.731 --> 17:12.460
All right! Way to go!

17:12.667 --> 17:13.998
Yea, me!

17:14.635 --> 17:16.626
So how did it happen?

17:16.904 --> 17:19.668
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

17:19.940 --> 17:21.134
What did he say?

17:21.409 --> 17:25.641
He understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

17:25.913 --> 17:28.905
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all:

17:29.150 --> 17:32.813
"ls he gonna call me the next day?"
and "Where is this going?"

17:33.921 --> 17:38.654
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

17:40.828 --> 17:44.423
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

17:46.200 --> 17:50.261
Sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

17:50.504 --> 17:54.304
If he wants to see me again, he can
call. If not, that's fine too.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.944
So after a lot of talking...

18:00.214 --> 18:02.114
... I convinced him.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.548
Let me get this straight.

18:07.788 --> 18:10.723
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

18:10.991 --> 18:13.551
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

18:15.896 --> 18:18.456
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

18:22.470 --> 18:24.631
This man is my god!

18:32.631 --> 18:34.588
This one is cute. Don't you think.

18:34.789 --> 18:38.146
Yeah. This one is cute, that one is cute, and they are all cute.

18:38.846 --> 18:41.203
Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.

18:42.403 --> 18:46.760
-Are you OK!
-yeah, me, sure!

18:48.060 --> 18:55.417
You know this is the big step for us,
but I'm got feeling that will be OK.

18:56.417 --> 18:59.774
I know, I know!

18:59.774 --> 19:03.131
Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.

19:06.131 --> 19:08.488
Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.

19:08.989 --> 19:12.446
See, we should work that out before we came down here.

19:13.846 --> 19:20.203
I will get a little narrow down with this one over here and this one with the stricks. You pick!

19:21.203 --> 19:25.560
-I have to pick?
-whickever one you want.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.617
I don't know.I mean it's not easy to choose.

19:32.917 --> 19:46.274
You know both cat are beautiful,funny.
You will be happy with either cat.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.631
Do you want to take both?

19:51.631 --> 19:58.988
I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.717
I didn't get a cat.

20:18.693 --> 20:21.753
That's interesting.

20:21.963 --> 20:25.899
No, it's not "interesting."
It's very, very not interesting.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.036
It's actually 100%
the opposite of interesting.

20:29.304 --> 20:30.532
I got it, Ross.

20:30.738 --> 20:33.434
You had no right to say
you had feelings for me.

20:34.742 --> 20:37.302
I was doing great with Julie
before I knew!

20:37.612 --> 20:39.443
I was doing great
before I knew about you!

20:39.714 --> 20:42.080
You think it's easy
to see you with Julie?

20:42.283 --> 20:44.308
You should've said something before!

20:44.586 --> 20:47.817
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?

20:48.089 --> 20:49.613
There was never a good time.

20:49.891 --> 20:53.224
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

20:53.628 --> 20:55.391
Not...

20:55.630 --> 20:56.961
...every night.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.333
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.263
You know, like ltalian guys...

21:03.505 --> 21:06.338
...or ex-fiances...

21:07.142 --> 21:09.474
...or ltalian guys.

21:11.279 --> 21:14.806
There was one ltalian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

21:15.116 --> 21:17.812
The point is, I don't need
this right now!

21:18.086 --> 21:19.747
Okay? It's too late.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.923
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!

21:23.158 --> 21:26.321
You're just gonna put away
your feelings for me?

21:26.528 --> 21:29.156
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.

21:29.430 --> 21:31.830
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.

21:32.133 --> 21:33.361
I don't need your ship!

21:33.635 --> 21:34.465
-Good.
-Good!

21:36.204 --> 21:39.139
And you know what?
Now I got closure!

22:31.826 --> 22:33.316
Try the bottom one.

23:00.256 --> 23:03.692
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

23:03.993 --> 23:06.621
We're not working out.
It's over.

23:07.096 --> 23:09.530
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

23:09.765 --> 23:13.496
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

23:14.703 --> 23:16.603
I don't mind the last pound.

23:16.805 --> 23:19.501
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

23:20.809 --> 23:23.471
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

23:24.179 --> 23:26.170
What you gonna do, fat boy?

23:27.883 --> 23:28.941
What?

23:30.886 --> 23:35.346
Nothing. Except tell you it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.452
Well, thanks.

23:37.660 --> 23:41.187
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

23:43.832 --> 23:48.769
You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

23:53.008 --> 23:56.466
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

23:58.514 --> 24:00.141
Well, no. But l....

24:00.582 --> 24:04.074
If it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

24:10.426 --> 24:12.917
You know, I try to stay positive.

24:13.595 --> 24:14.892
So you....

24:15.531 --> 24:17.999
You feel like going for a run?

24:20.736 --> 24:22.169
All right.

24:22.538 --> 24:27.475
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
