WEBVTT

00:05.071 --> 00:08.438
"We've got 3 minutes till it blows.
We won't make it!"

00:08.641 --> 00:11.633
"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself!"

00:13.446 --> 00:14.811
"I won't leave you. "

00:15.015 --> 00:19.452
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"

00:21.354 --> 00:24.790
- "No, you're not. Not to me. "
- Oh, my God.

00:25.325 --> 00:27.987
- What?
- I am extremely talented.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.653
- Yeah. You're great.
- Yeah.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.823
- Okay, let's take it from..
- No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.665
I thought I was pretty good, too.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.669
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.468
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.271
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.313
Fine. I'll do it without you!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.409
I don't need you or anybody else!

00:53.653 --> 00:55.883
I'm gonna make it on my own!

00:57.590 --> 01:00.354
You'll see! You'll all see!

01:02.562 --> 01:05.622
The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.627
So what are you auditioning for?

01:42.836 --> 01:44.098
It's a new TV show.

01:44.270 --> 01:48.764
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

01:50.243 --> 01:53.974
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with my robot partner.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.547
He's a computerized humanoid...

01:56.716 --> 01:59.879
electronically enhanced
secret enforcer.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.544
Or "C.H.E.E.S.E."

02:03.857 --> 02:08.123
- So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
- That's the title!

02:09.996 --> 02:13.397
They lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese. "

02:13.566 --> 02:15.124
That is lucky.

02:16.536 --> 02:19.004
So Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

02:19.205 --> 02:20.866
the star of your own TV show.

02:21.074 --> 02:25.511
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac. " Hey, you love those!

02:26.146 --> 02:29.240
Don't get your hopes up.
It probably won't happen.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.110
Why would you say that?

02:31.317 --> 02:34.343
Well, I mean, come on, guys.
My own TV show?

02:34.554 --> 02:37.318
- I don't know if I'm good enough.
- I am.

02:39.192 --> 02:42.355
What are you talking about?
You're a terrific actor.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.693
- You really think so?
- How can you even ask that question?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.799
- She's pretty.
- Yeah. And she's really nice too.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.098
She taught me all about
how to work with cameras...

02:54.307 --> 02:57.037
and "smell the fart" acting.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.077
- I'm sorry. What?
- Excuse me?

03:01.981 --> 03:05.041
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

03:05.251 --> 03:08.186
sometimes you need time
to remember your next one.

03:08.621 --> 03:13.456
So while you're thinking of it, you
take this pause where you look intense.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.594
You know, like this:

03:17.564 --> 03:18.963
Okay.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.427
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

03:23.136 --> 03:26.799
Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,
your sister's surgeon.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.241
You sister is suffering from a...

03:34.614 --> 03:39.779
Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.

03:41.321 --> 03:46.486
And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.156
All you want is a tinkle

03:52.932 --> 03:55.264
What you envy's a schwang

03:55.835 --> 03:58.895
A thing through which you can tinkle

03:59.339 --> 04:02.001
Or play with or simply let hang

04:02.208 --> 04:04.574
I play Al Pacino's butt.

04:06.846 --> 04:07.835
All right?

04:08.014 --> 04:11.848
He goes into the shower and then,
I'm his butt.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.542
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, you guys.

04:14.721 --> 04:18.088
This is a movie and Al Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

04:18.291 --> 04:22.159
It's terrific. You deserve this.
After years of struggling...

04:22.362 --> 04:25.957
you've finally cracked your way
into show business.

04:28.901 --> 04:33.031
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.639
- No, you're right, it is.
- Yeah.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.435
So, you gonna invite us
to the big opening?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.941
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.

04:43.149 --> 04:48.109
Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck

04:50.390 --> 04:52.255
Yeah, whatever.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.086
Wow, if I could dance,
I'd be a triple threat.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.436
It's your turn.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.302
Oh, are we playing this?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.132
How'd the audition go?

05:11.311 --> 05:15.543
Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

05:15.748 --> 05:20.913
Wait. Are you pretending it didn't
go well, but it really did go well?

05:22.021 --> 05:25.286
- Yeah, did I fool you?
- Totally!

05:26.726 --> 05:29.923
- So it did go well?
- Amazingly well!

05:30.129 --> 05:33.565
- Great!
- It's down to me and two other guys.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.893
And they're really good.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.903
One's from those allergy commercials
who's chased by flowers.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.733
Oh, I love that guy!

05:42.709 --> 05:44.802
What are you doing?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.706
What am I doing?

05:48.414 --> 05:52.248
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback is tomorrow at 5:00.

05:52.452 --> 05:57.287
- I feel like my head's gonna explode.
- Well, it is overdue.

05:57.457 --> 06:01.416
- Don't worry. You'll be fine.
- But it's so much pressure.

06:01.627 --> 06:05.757
What you guys do is different.
I don't know if you'd understand.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.733
Yeah, we don't have pressure
at our jobs.

06:09.936 --> 06:14.896
I know what time it is, but I'm looking
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.469
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.705
- Is it dirty?
- Don't worry, I'll wash it.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.041
Don't. I like it dirty.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.318
That's your call.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.821
So what are you going to do next?

06:32.024 --> 06:34.492
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.958
Are they firm?

06:39.098 --> 06:42.363
- They're all right.
- You sure they haven't gone bad?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.163
You sure they're not very, very bad?

06:49.041 --> 06:52.943
- No, really. They're okay.
- You gonna slice them real nice?

06:53.212 --> 06:56.340
Actually, I was gonna
do them julienne.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.215
I'm out of here.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.082
I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...

07:03.289 --> 07:05.314
and she didn't even buy it.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.122
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

07:09.328 --> 07:11.387
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.662
Bye. Call me when you
get this message.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.267
Well, what happened?

07:16.469 --> 07:20.565
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until...

07:24.076 --> 07:25.566
Oh, my God.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.938
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.418
- Was it?
- Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.390
You ate my sandwich?

07:40.793 --> 07:43.125
It was a mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.530
Really?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.791
Now calm down.

07:47.967 --> 07:52.131
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.700
- What?
- Well, it was quite large.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.969
I had to throw most of it away.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.876
You threw my sandwich away?

08:03.716 --> 08:05.616
My sandwich?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.753
My sandwich!

08:10.223 --> 08:12.748
It's just, I want this part so much.

08:13.192 --> 08:17.253
If I don't get this part, I'm never
gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.

08:17.463 --> 08:20.023
I didn't say that. That doesn't count.

08:24.070 --> 08:27.130
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.308
I just moved across the hall.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.704
And we would have you over all the time...

08:31.911 --> 08:35.574
if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.782
You're right, I could never lie to you.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.385
She hates you.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.090
Should I get that?

08:47.860 --> 08:52.661
Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

08:53.132 --> 08:56.727
Yeah, okay. So the audition's
been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?

08:56.936 --> 08:58.904
Okay, great. Bye.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.772
- Aren't you dressed yet?
- Am I naked again?

09:13.419 --> 09:15.944
We're meeting my parents
in 15 minutes.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.885
I was just talking to the guys.
Look at them.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.184
Is it okay if they come visit?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.828
What about my allergies?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.726
Right. Your allergies.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.459
All her. She hates you.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.315
Yes! All right.

09:46.519 --> 09:50.751
How cool would it be if you could watch
a life-size version of this?

09:50.957 --> 09:54.757
- I mean, how crazy would that be?
- As crazy as soccer?

09:59.298 --> 10:00.322
Hello?

10:01.567 --> 10:04.661
What are you talking about?
The audition's at 5.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.671
Well, nobody told me.

10:10.242 --> 10:11.470
Who'd you talk to?

10:16.382 --> 10:17.576
Never mind.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.951
You mean you didn't get it from this?

10:21.654 --> 10:25.988
- The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.
- Maybe we can fix it.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.921
Maybe we can send him
some big flowers and scare him!

10:30.596 --> 10:34.498
How could you do this? This could've
turned my career around.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.033
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.603
Why'd you answer my phone?

10:40.773 --> 10:44.004
- I have a machine!
- Which I bought for you.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.978
Taught you how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

10:49.782 --> 10:52.273
If there was anything I could do,
I'd do it.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.249
Everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

10:55.454 --> 10:58.355
He could have gotten me a VCR
or golf clubs.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.687
But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller. "

11:02.228 --> 11:05.595
The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap!"

11:05.765 --> 11:08.063
- It's not that bad.
- Easy for you to say.

11:08.267 --> 11:12.067
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T" collection.

11:12.638 --> 11:16.199
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!

11:16.375 --> 11:18.400
I pity the fool that...

11:20.146 --> 11:23.912
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I were talking and...

11:24.083 --> 11:26.483
one thing led to another and...

11:26.986 --> 11:29.477
And what? Did you sleep with her?

11:29.655 --> 11:33.489
- No! No, I just kissed her.
- What? That's even worse!

11:34.360 --> 11:37.261
- How?
- I don't know! But it's the same!

11:37.663 --> 11:40.860
I have no excuses.
I was over the line.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.432
Over the line?

11:42.635 --> 11:45.832
You're so far past the line
you can't even see it!

11:46.038 --> 11:48.029
The line is a dot to you!

11:48.774 --> 11:51.402
I'm not saying you should
magically forgive me.

11:51.844 --> 11:55.177
But you're not perfect.
You've made errors in judgment.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.537
Name one!

11:58.017 --> 11:59.541
What happened?

12:00.119 --> 12:03.520
Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

12:04.323 --> 12:08.783
How were you locked in?
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

12:09.261 --> 12:11.286
This guy came to look at the unit...

12:11.497 --> 12:14.898
and he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a man.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.599
So you got in voluntarily?

12:17.803 --> 12:20.101
I was trying to make a sale!

12:20.940 --> 12:24.205
If I ever run into him again,
know what I'll do?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.105
Bend over?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.202
There's Lori.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.817
Remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.886
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

12:37.656 --> 12:40.989
Well, well. Look what you brought.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.057
And what did you bring?

12:45.064 --> 12:46.895
She's checking her coat.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.398
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.903
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.303
Janice?

13:04.917 --> 13:08.614
Oh, my God!

13:10.156 --> 13:12.750
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.217
What?

13:15.594 --> 13:18.927
No way. I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.962
You said he'd do my inseam...

13:21.167 --> 13:24.933
then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was...

13:25.137 --> 13:26.297
What?

13:27.006 --> 13:28.701
Cupping.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.511
That's how they do pants!

13:36.081 --> 13:40.575
- Isn't that how a tailor measures?
- Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

13:44.290 --> 13:45.621
I said name one!

13:54.433 --> 13:58.426
- I can't believe I did this.
- Stop beating yourself up.

13:58.637 --> 14:02.232
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

14:02.808 --> 14:06.471
There aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me?

14:06.879 --> 14:09.347
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

14:09.882 --> 14:12.646
- Do you think he'll forgive me?
- Of course.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.253
The important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.220
- You know what, I kind of have.
- Already?

14:19.391 --> 14:21.951
That was pretty bad what you did.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.059
He will forgive you.

14:24.263 --> 14:28.757
I like to bring a pad with me when
I answer the phone, okay?

14:28.968 --> 14:33.234
- You didn't see how mad he was.
- I'm sure he'll forgive you.

14:33.405 --> 14:37.364
We've all been there. You fight,
you make up. That's how it works.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.477
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

14:40.679 --> 14:42.704
Yeah! You and that copy girl...

14:42.915 --> 14:45.850
which yesterday you took
responsibility for!

14:46.051 --> 14:49.020
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.416
- I didn't finish the letter.
- What?

14:51.624 --> 14:54.752
- I fell asleep.
- You fell asleep?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.722
It was 5:30 in the morning.

14:58.931 --> 15:03.595
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.831
Front and back!

15:09.041 --> 15:13.910
And by the way?
Y- O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are. "

15:14.113 --> 15:16.343
Y- O-U-R means "your. "

15:16.882 --> 15:19.783
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.680
We are so over!

15:23.555 --> 15:24.852
Fine by me!

15:26.659 --> 15:29.856
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

15:30.062 --> 15:33.930
it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

15:34.900 --> 15:36.390
I knew it!

15:37.603 --> 15:40.936
- You had no right to go out with him.
- That's ridiculous..

15:41.340 --> 15:43.399
- You sold me out!
- I did not!

15:43.676 --> 15:47.203
- You did! You sold me..
- Would you let me talk?

15:49.648 --> 15:51.377
Did you just flick me?

15:52.851 --> 15:55.251
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and..

15:55.821 --> 15:57.152
Stop it!

15:58.624 --> 15:59.852
- Stop.
- Stop.

16:00.059 --> 16:03.290
- All right. No, let's not do this.
- No!

16:04.396 --> 16:06.455
- Happy thoughts.
- No!

16:07.666 --> 16:09.725
- Happy thoughts.
- No!

16:11.003 --> 16:14.166
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

16:21.647 --> 16:25.583
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.018
- Fine.
- Fine.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.688
There we go.

16:32.257 --> 16:36.694
You know what? If we were in prison,
you guys would be my bitches.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.731
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

16:47.473 --> 16:51.432
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearing everything you own.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.641
Oh, my God!

16:54.246 --> 16:59.309
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

17:00.586 --> 17:03.885
Maybe if I wasn't going commando.

17:06.825 --> 17:11.819
I tell you, it's hot with all this on.
I'd better not do any lunges.

18:04.316 --> 18:05.476
Joey?

18:06.618 --> 18:10.213
Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!

18:14.393 --> 18:16.452
Hello? Damn it!

18:18.697 --> 18:19.721
Hello?

18:20.132 --> 18:24.193
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

18:25.137 --> 18:28.732
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

18:28.907 --> 18:33.435
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.738
That's great.
I'll give Joey the message.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.439
Yes!

18:39.351 --> 18:40.375
Okay.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.184
Mac...

18:42.855 --> 18:44.550
audition...

18:45.424 --> 18:47.358
at 2:00.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.025
Allergy...

18:50.596 --> 18:51.824
actor...

18:52.998 --> 18:54.556
attacked.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.938
By dog...

19:02.341 --> 19:03.740
not...

19:04.109 --> 19:06.600
flowers.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.654
- Tell me you got the message.
- What message?

19:17.856 --> 19:21.417
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.
They needed you at 2.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.788
What? It's 6:00!

19:23.996 --> 19:26.396
Look! I wrote it on the board!

19:26.598 --> 19:29.260
I wrote it down,
then went looking for you!

19:29.468 --> 19:31.299
I went to Ross's, the coffee house...

19:31.503 --> 19:34.301
I went to any place
they make sandwiches!

19:34.840 --> 19:37.809
- I can't believe this, Chandler!
- I'm sorry.

19:38.544 --> 19:43.504
- I don't know what to say!
- You might say congratulations!

19:43.715 --> 19:47.446
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

19:48.387 --> 19:50.787
Was that funny? I was worried.

19:51.089 --> 19:54.252
- I'm sorry.
- That fake-out thing is just mean.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.917
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.461
Well, that's good.

19:59.665 --> 20:03.431
Because you didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for you!

20:03.602 --> 20:04.967
That's mean!

20:06.905 --> 20:09.396
- You had me going!
- We could do this all day.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.439
Yeah, you're right.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.570
Let's talk about what a huge star
I'm gonna be.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.976
You're gonna be huge!
I'm gonna hug you!

20:17.216 --> 20:19.013
- You hug me!
- All right.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.813
- Do we do this too much?
- I think so.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.984
- Yeah. Get off me.
- Yeah.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.117
"C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.525
Route your backup power source
through your CPU."

21:06.732 --> 21:11.135
"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!"

21:15.540 --> 21:17.440
"Then I'll carry you!"

21:17.743 --> 21:19.734
"That'll be a neat trick... "

21:20.779 --> 21:23.304
"when you're dead!"

21:24.616 --> 21:26.140
You don't have to yell.

21:26.385 --> 21:30.446
There was just an explosion.
My hearing would be impaired.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.217
I thought you were great.

21:33.425 --> 21:36.121
For a minute, I was like,
"Where'd Ross go?"

21:37.629 --> 21:41.224
Thank you. And that first scene
where you meet Mac...

21:41.433 --> 21:43.333
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God. I mean...

21:43.702 --> 21:44.828
And you know what?

21:45.037 --> 21:48.473
That's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.239
- Holding us back.
- Totally.
