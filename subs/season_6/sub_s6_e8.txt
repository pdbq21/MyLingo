00:05.172 --> 00:08.164
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

00:08.408 --> 00:11.343
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

00:11.578 --> 00:15.344
for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

00:16.016 --> 00:17.984
Sure, neighbor! Come on in!

00:19.353 --> 00:20.377
Is Janine around?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.053
She's at dance class.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.550
Can I check my room?

00:23.757 --> 00:26.692
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.022
Oh, my God!

00:32.232 --> 00:35.065
It's like a guy never lived in here.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.535
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.264
It is?

00:41.708 --> 00:45.269
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

00:46.613 --> 00:50.344
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

00:51.785 --> 00:55.050
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

00:55.255 --> 00:56.916
This is a "guy's" place.

00:57.124 --> 01:00.252
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

01:02.563 --> 01:08.627
And your head's gonna be under a big,
brown, drying, big, drying.. It's not good.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.438
-You're right. I'll talk to her.
-Talk to her. Be a man!

01:12.673 --> 01:14.470
-I'm a man.
-Defend yourself!

01:16.009 --> 01:18.136
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.869
Be right there, sweetums.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.006
Totally different situation.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.477
The One With Ross' Teeth

02:04.057 --> 02:05.046
Hey, guys.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.159
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.

02:07.394 --> 02:11.057
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

02:11.264 --> 02:14.665
Is this Hillary, your
hot assistant chef, Hillary?

02:15.736 --> 02:18.261
The one that stares at me
when I come in?

02:18.672 --> 02:22.403
The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.840
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.312
Why don't you set us up?

02:29.516 --> 02:33.452
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?

02:36.089 --> 02:37.579
Come on, I'm serious.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.819
Okay, I'll do it, but as long as
you promise you won't marry her.

02:42.029 --> 02:46.489
Fine, I..
What if she's the one?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.964
Man, you have a problem.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.828
Rachel?

02:54.041 --> 02:57.943
I'm making up flyers to try
to get new massage clients.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.739
Can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copier?

03:00.947 --> 03:05.384
Sure, but they might think it's weird
since I don't work there anymore.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.278
Oh, my God! What happened?

03:08.588 --> 03:10.453
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.089
Well, that's great! Congratulations!

03:15.228 --> 03:17.059
A year ago.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.660
You've lasted all year! Good for you.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.970
You could still use the copier
where I actually work.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.936
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.407
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.979
-I don't think my boss likes me.
-I don't think mine likes me.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.082
Maybe it's a universal thing.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.983
Maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.650
Let's head off to work.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.961
-Thank you.
-Sure.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.965
You will not believe this.

03:57.204 --> 04:00.105
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.298
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

04:02.542 --> 04:04.635
A little. He seems really nice.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.870
-Good kisser.
-What?

04:07.347 --> 04:08.814
What?

04:09.282 --> 04:10.772
-You kissed him?
-Totally.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.448
Phoebe, are you serious?

04:14.054 --> 04:16.181
He came in and introduced himself.

04:16.389 --> 04:19.654
The next thing I know,
we're making out!

04:20.460 --> 04:22.894
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

04:25.198 --> 04:26.187
Phoebe.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.891
I'm supposed to ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

04:31.538 --> 04:32.800
No, yeah, I should.

04:45.585 --> 04:46.882
Hey, Joey.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.986
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.989
Do you know this kid?
Is it a relative?

04:54.194 --> 04:56.094
No. I just thought it was cute.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.763
That's what I was afraid of. Okay....

04:59.699 --> 05:02.566
I really want you to feel
at home here, but...

05:02.769 --> 05:05.704
some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

05:06.873 --> 05:07.862
Like what?

05:08.074 --> 05:11.601
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.568
We can't have that.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.576
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

05:16.783 --> 05:21.083
I don't know this baby. I don't know
if she's a famous artist or not.

05:23.423 --> 05:27.757
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.225
I'm sorry. I wanted to make
the place a little nicer.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.023
But it's too much stuff.

05:33.300 --> 05:37.566
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

05:37.771 --> 05:41.730
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.264
I just thought..

05:43.476 --> 05:46.036
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.202
But come on.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.883
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

05:51.985 --> 05:53.646
It's a curling iron.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.954
Well, that's okay then.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.630
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

06:05.832 --> 06:09.893
and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

06:10.971 --> 06:14.964
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.110
-It's clean.
-It feels different.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.676
It's dry.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.940
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.351
Also what is with
these chips you bought?

06:28.588 --> 06:31.352
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.360
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.804
Kim, hi.

06:59.619 --> 07:04.716
I handed in that marketing report, and
I never got to hear what you thought.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.114
I didn't read it.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.630
The spring line's really gonna be
great this year, huh?

07:20.006 --> 07:23.635
I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.369
Tell me everything.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.346
Hey, guys.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.384
What's up?

07:37.057 --> 07:38.319
You know....

07:38.591 --> 07:40.183
Oh, my God.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.785
What happened to your teeth?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.361
I whitened them.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.092
Really?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.967
What do you think?

07:51.171 --> 07:53.731
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.265
Come on, seriously.

07:58.345 --> 08:02.509
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old...

08:02.749 --> 08:04.410
human teeth?

08:05.618 --> 08:08.951
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.184
-How much longer?
-A day.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.787
Tonight is your date with Hillary.

08:16.029 --> 08:20.022
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

08:22.302 --> 08:25.430
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

08:26.306 --> 08:28.137
She will be after tonight.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.703
Oh, Rach.
Do you notice anything..?

08:32.912 --> 08:35.403
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.976
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

08:40.220 --> 08:44.418
but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.921
-What?
-Oh, my God!

08:46.159 --> 08:49.617
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.730
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

08:52.966 --> 08:55.457
it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.398
I am proud of all my friends today.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.399
I can't believe Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.837
I'm so jealous!

09:05.779 --> 09:08.304
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.510
Chandler, please. Come on.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.184
Look at him.

09:13.420 --> 09:17.151
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.017
Here.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.421
Who's the silver fox?

09:24.631 --> 09:28.089
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

09:28.268 --> 09:29.257
Oh, wait.

09:29.536 --> 09:33.028
"Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

09:33.673 --> 09:36.972
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

09:37.844 --> 09:41.177
-What?
-Ralph doesn't look like that guy.

09:41.448 --> 09:46.215
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack..

09:46.453 --> 09:51.481
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy!

09:51.658 --> 09:52.647
What?

09:53.526 --> 09:56.495
I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

09:56.729 --> 10:00.995
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!

10:01.201 --> 10:03.726
Why would the copy guy say
he's Ralph Lauren?

10:03.970 --> 10:05.801
To get you to make out with him!

10:13.146 --> 10:15.137
This will make them look less white.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.309
Nope.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.389
Colors that don't work are...

10:24.591 --> 10:28.652
blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.626
Do you wanna try this highlighter again?

10:33.500 --> 10:36.492
No, I think it poisoned me a little.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.604
The date starts in an hour.
What am I'm gonna do?

10:41.241 --> 10:46.144
Maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

10:46.379 --> 10:50.406
Oh, great! So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.814
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you..

10:55.088 --> 10:56.521
Whoa!

10:56.756 --> 10:59.020
We're not 13 anymore.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.028
This is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.197
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

11:06.432 --> 11:08.627
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.166
What?

11:11.171 --> 11:14.163
Half the people.. I mean..
Just try it and see.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.672
I am not putting on makeup.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.371
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.377
No! Demon! Demon!

11:30.456 --> 11:34.552
Our drawers will smell nice, and
we didn't waste these pantyhose.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.723
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.623
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.893
We've got to organize
the wrapping paper.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.970
I've really gotten in touch with
my feminine side enough today.

11:49.175 --> 11:52.576
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.912
This has been a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.676
I just feel like I need
to be in a "guy" place...

12:00.987 --> 12:02.887
do kind of a "man" thing.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.489
You go over to Joey's and...

12:05.725 --> 12:08.660
drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

12:09.495 --> 12:13.226
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.096
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.270
I'm sorry. We do.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.168
I don't know why I said that.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.047
Hey, Chandler.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.549
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.351
No, thanks, Josephine.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.792
Ross, I was wondering if..

12:46.132 --> 12:49.260
Oh, my God! Where are all the men?

13:00.246 --> 13:02.874
-Hi, Kim.
-Hi, Rachel.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.476
Remember what happened yesterday?
Well, it didn't happen.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.120
You didn't cancel the fabric order?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.556
Okay, two things didn't happen.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.728
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

13:16.929 --> 13:19.420
Well, it turns out that's not true.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.657
It's not true?
That's interesting.

13:21.901 --> 13:26.429
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copier...

13:26.639 --> 13:30.405
yesterday during lunch, and
that keycard belonged to you.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.604
You think I made out with him?

13:32.779 --> 13:33.768
Listen to me...

13:34.013 --> 13:37.949
sleeping with Ralph is not
gonna get you my job.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.415
I don't want your job. I don't.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.951
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

13:43.189 --> 13:47.091
Nobody made out with him.
I didn't use my keycard yesterday.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.795
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.189
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.150
Yeah. Nothing happened.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.687
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.965
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

14:29.168 --> 14:31.500
Soon, I hope to open
my own restaurant.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.837
You're a really great listener.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.510
Most guys I go out with,
they talk and talk.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.249
It's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

14:48.321 --> 14:51.415
I've been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.793
Come on, I want to know.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.092
Okay. I'm from Long lsland.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.930
I came to the city for college.

15:06.205 --> 15:09.971
I have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

15:10.276 --> 15:14.770
I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.

15:19.152 --> 15:23.612
If you sear the stems of the flowers
first in a frying pan...

15:23.823 --> 15:26.656
your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.692
Joey, that is such a great tip!

15:30.963 --> 15:34.524
Monica, I need to talk
to the girl with the flowers.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.836
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

15:40.072 --> 15:42.802
out of a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.241
I love birds.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.144
What is the matter with you?

15:49.982 --> 15:51.643
-What?
-You're arranging flowers!

15:53.252 --> 15:55.311
You got dead flowers!

15:55.521 --> 15:58.490
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers!

16:00.426 --> 16:01.552
This is not Joey!

16:01.761 --> 16:04.855
Look, I am still Joey, okay?

16:05.097 --> 16:07.998
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.

16:08.201 --> 16:12.729
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.673
You're turning into a woman.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.732
No, I'm not.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.444
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.113
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

16:25.685 --> 16:28.415
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

16:29.388 --> 16:30.582
Oh, my God!

16:30.790 --> 16:32.621
I'm a woman!

16:39.398 --> 16:43.266
So now she thinks that I made out
with him to get her job.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.029
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.

16:46.272 --> 16:51.369
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

16:52.578 --> 16:56.207
What if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

16:56.415 --> 17:00.215
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.148
Did she ever think of that?

17:06.425 --> 17:08.325
You were with Kenny today.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.392
Just for a second.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.429
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.999
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.

17:18.571 --> 17:23.668
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.103
Sleep with Kenny.

17:30.082 --> 17:33.279
-That wouldn't help me.
-Oh, yes, it would.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.582
I've had a really good time tonight.

17:38.824 --> 17:42.453
I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.162
Me neither.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.765
I've had a really
good time too, you know.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.497
Are you gonna eat that bread?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.471
I just like the smell.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.705
You make me laugh.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.278
Would you like to move to the couch?

18:13.225 --> 18:15.853
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.687
How about all the way?

18:19.198 --> 18:20.358
Okay.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.336
Wow, cool poster.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.069
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

18:34.647 --> 18:35.909
So...

18:37.350 --> 18:38.908
where were we?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.418
Are those your teeth?

18:48.694 --> 18:51.094
You can see them, huh?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.924
Yes. They're insanely white.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.500
I did that for you.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.405
What's the matter with you?

19:00.840 --> 19:05.402
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999!

19:13.252 --> 19:15.186
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

19:15.388 --> 19:20.121
Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

19:20.426 --> 19:23.554
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.260
Okay, look.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.761
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

19:28.034 --> 19:32.733
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.064
Oh, really?

19:34.473 --> 19:36.703
Yeah, he dumped me.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.372
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.742
Even though you're a very, very...

19:44.984 --> 19:47.316
very beautiful woman...

19:47.720 --> 19:51.121
I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

19:51.390 --> 19:54.621
But he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

19:54.827 --> 19:58.786
especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

19:59.065 --> 20:00.794
in the Ralph Lauren machine."

20:03.302 --> 20:05.668
You expect me to believe..

20:07.006 --> 20:08.735
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.188
Oh, my God.

20:29.462 --> 20:34.593
He gave you the coldest look I've
ever seen. It's like he hates you!

20:34.834 --> 20:36.324
Then it is true!

20:37.670 --> 20:42.164
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.170
Oh, honey, come here.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.277
Oh, it'll be okay.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.942
We've all been there.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.648
You and Ralph?

20:57.056 --> 20:59.149
Kenny the copy boy.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.833
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter? You upset?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.574
Would you like me to get
a pint of ice cream and two spoons?

21:19.745 --> 21:23.545
No, no, no ice cream. Look....

21:23.716 --> 21:26.014
We gotta get rid of all
this girlie stuff in here.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.119
I gotta be a man!

21:28.854 --> 21:32.381
The living room has to
remain a guy place, okay?

21:32.658 --> 21:34.387
That's the way it has to be.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.221
I'll just put it all in my room.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.090
Good. Great.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.833
Thanks for being so understanding.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.763
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.505
But you could put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.539
I mean, if you want to.

21:53.846 --> 21:54.835
Okay.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.776
And maybe the watering can there.

21:57.950 --> 21:58.939
Sure.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.847
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

22:03.122 --> 22:06.285
Joey, do you want me to put
it all in your room?

22:06.525 --> 22:08.686
Okay.
