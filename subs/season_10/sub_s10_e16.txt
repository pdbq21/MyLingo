WEBVTT

00:00.528 --> 00:02.760
All right,
let's play one more time, okay?

00:02.930 --> 00:05.845
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.

00:06.013 --> 00:09.008
Okay. I can't believe
I'm risking this again, but you're on.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.650
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

00:12.820 --> 00:14.140
Just flip.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.855
- Tails!
- Damn it!

00:18.866 --> 00:21.941
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around 7.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.624
Oh, that sounds good.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.672
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

00:26.834 --> 00:29.304
- It's all done.
- Oh, yeah, right.

00:29.476 --> 00:33.793
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.638
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.

00:37.044 --> 00:40.723
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
that I'm taking is in the bedroom.

00:40.888 --> 00:44.406
This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are
the boxes that I'm having shipped...

00:44.572 --> 00:46.769
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.

00:46.934 --> 00:49.166
- Okay, so you've done some good work.
- Yeah.

00:49.336 --> 00:50.657
What about your carryons?

00:50.818 --> 00:53.893
Oh, well, everything that I need
is in here...

00:54.061 --> 00:56.418
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...

00:56.584 --> 00:59.545
...organized in the order that
I will be needing them.

00:59.707 --> 01:03.180
Oh, my God.
I have nothing left to teach you.

01:05.192 --> 01:08.426
- Where's your passport?
- It should be next to my plane ticket.

01:08.596 --> 01:11.750
- Well, it's not.
- What? Well, maybe I put it in here?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.400
Oh, it's not in there!

01:14.562 --> 01:17.032
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!

01:17.324 --> 01:20.080
- Here, let me help you.
- Shoot.

01:21.929 --> 01:23.409
I can't believe I did this.

01:23.571 --> 01:27.123
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

02:16.263 --> 02:18.700
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?

02:18.866 --> 02:20.141
I know.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.906
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...

02:24.071 --> 02:27.863
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
part where the baby's gonna come out.

02:30.477 --> 02:31.753
- Hey!
- Hey.

02:31.919 --> 02:36.314
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

02:36.483 --> 02:38.476
That's because I'm pregnant.

02:39.206 --> 02:42.042
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.

02:42.209 --> 02:45.649
I'm just always afraid that people think
I'm just fat with big breasts.

02:46.574 --> 02:48.327
No, no, I knew.

02:52.019 --> 02:55.253
- Okay, well, stop staring at them.
- She brought them up.

02:57.064 --> 02:59.136
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.

02:59.306 --> 03:01.344
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.

03:01.509 --> 03:04.948
And I wanted her to get to know the
doctors and get settled into the hotel.

03:05.112 --> 03:09.075
- Why isn't she staying with you guys?
- Because we're moving in a couple days.

03:09.236 --> 03:13.233
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.

03:14.441 --> 03:16.115
Erica, those things aren't free.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.278
They have one of the highest markups
of any consumer product...

03:19.446 --> 03:23.204
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.765
I'll be right back.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.932
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys
are leaving this place.

03:32.099 --> 03:34.536
I know. I know.

03:34.702 --> 03:38.141
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.

03:38.305 --> 03:41.904
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

03:42.069 --> 03:44.380
Plus, how much a month does it cost
to feed Joey?

03:44.552 --> 03:46.590
Yeah, it takes two incomes.

03:46.754 --> 03:49.111
Is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.234
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.790
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.

03:53.961 --> 03:56.797
Packing. Sexy cheerleader comedy.

03:57.484 --> 04:01.481
Helpful brother.
Creepy Ioner at teen movie.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.809
"Creepy..."

04:12.459 --> 04:16.342
- What are you guys doing?
- Try it. I can't feel a thing.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.149
Are you kidding?

04:26.754 --> 04:28.872
- This is packing?
- We're taking a break.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.311
From?

04:30.477 --> 04:32.470
Jumping on the bed.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.479
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.684
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.247
- You got it.
- All right.

04:41.408 --> 04:43.527
All right, she's right.
We gotta get serious.

04:43.691 --> 04:46.572
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!

04:48.455 --> 04:52.134
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.

04:52.299 --> 04:55.659
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
you repack whatever Joey packs.

05:00.027 --> 05:01.381
You guys hear a ringing?

05:03.270 --> 05:08.589
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.

05:08.756 --> 05:11.033
I didn't know you guys had it in you.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.680
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...

05:14.842 --> 05:17.404
...how much this bums me out.

05:17.925 --> 05:20.522
I didn't know Monica had these.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.651
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.

05:26.814 --> 05:30.412
Why would she use them with Richard
and not me? I can be kinky.

05:30.978 --> 05:35.419
I once did a naked dance for her
with scarves.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.903
Bumming hard, guys.
Bumming hard.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.515
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?

05:48.676 --> 05:50.110
Oh, he has a gig.

05:50.277 --> 05:52.999
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?

05:53.160 --> 05:55.153
My husband has a gig.

05:56.243 --> 05:57.519
Yeah? Where is it?

05:57.685 --> 06:01.728
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.

06:03.370 --> 06:04.964
Rock on!

06:06.013 --> 06:08.689
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?

06:08.856 --> 06:12.056
I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...

06:12.219 --> 06:15.055
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me.

06:15.222 --> 06:20.062
So enjoy. Smoked oyster casserole
with a breakfast-cereal crust.

06:20.948 --> 06:26.745
kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

06:27.995 --> 06:29.270
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:29.436 --> 06:31.349
- Where's Rach?
- She's putting Emma down.

06:31.519 --> 06:34.639
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.

06:34.802 --> 06:38.560
She's kind of emotional, so no one
say anything to set her off, okay?

06:39.807 --> 06:41.082
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

06:41.248 --> 06:43.127
There she is.

06:43.531 --> 06:45.728
Hi, you guys.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.568
What did I just say?

06:49.537 --> 06:52.178
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

06:52.339 --> 06:54.810
- Come here, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.

06:55.823 --> 06:58.385
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.

06:58.546 --> 07:00.299
How am I gonna say goodbye
to Rachel?

07:00.668 --> 07:02.979
I know, she's been
such a big part of my life.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.713
It feels like when Melrose Place
got cancelled.

07:09.957 --> 07:11.551
I mean...

07:12.199 --> 07:14.841
Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.

07:16.363 --> 07:18.721
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?

07:18.886 --> 07:22.404
Who loses 57 coin tosses
in a row? You know?

07:22.570 --> 07:25.370
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

07:30.137 --> 07:31.777
Wait a minute.

07:31.939 --> 07:35.982
- Yes, Joe?
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

07:39.306 --> 07:41.458
So you doing okay?

07:41.629 --> 07:44.988
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?

07:45.152 --> 07:48.386
Yes! You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...

07:48.556 --> 07:51.152
...and I can travel internationally again.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.314
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

07:57.084 --> 08:00.045
You know what? I have some
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

08:00.207 --> 08:05.127
...to each of you. I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.891
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?

08:10.057 --> 08:11.731
If I had to guess, I'd say...

08:11.899 --> 08:15.372
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.

08:18.786 --> 08:20.904
Pheebs, I don't even know
where to start.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.985
Okay, well, before you do, I know we
weren't supposed to get you presents...

08:25.152 --> 08:27.384
...but I do have something for you.

08:30.197 --> 08:32.349
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...

08:32.520 --> 08:34.239
...with a bit of my saliva on it...

08:35.963 --> 08:39.436
...so that if they perfect the cloning
process while you're over there...

08:39.607 --> 08:42.727
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.447
I'm gonna throw this away...

08:50.017 --> 08:53.730
...but thank you so much
for the gesture.

08:54.982 --> 08:56.576
Chandler?

08:56.944 --> 09:00.782
I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.

09:00.948 --> 09:04.307
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...

09:04.471 --> 09:08.549
...and you want to engage in a little
light bondage and mustache play.

09:10.077 --> 09:11.637
What? These aren't mine.

09:11.799 --> 09:13.074
Oh, yeah, right!

09:13.240 --> 09:16.076
Good luck getting another scarf dance
from me.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.435
That would be a terrible punishment.

09:21.168 --> 09:23.240
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.

09:23.410 --> 09:26.291
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?

09:26.654 --> 09:28.373
Rachel used to live in that room.

09:28.536 --> 09:31.975
Rachel. With handcuffs.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.733
Interesting.

09:34.301 --> 09:35.895
Joey's bare ass.

09:39.827 --> 09:41.626
Well played.

09:46.994 --> 09:49.875
- I love you, Phoebe.
- I love you too.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.635
Please...

09:53.801 --> 09:55.076
Please don't...

09:55.242 --> 09:58.682
Don't turn into, you know,
a French bitch.

09:59.326 --> 10:00.920
I won't.

10:02.610 --> 10:05.445
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.

10:05.613 --> 10:06.888
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:07.054 --> 10:08.329
- Monica?
- Yeah?

10:08.495 --> 10:11.331
- Will you come with me for a minute?
- Sure.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.177
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

10:15.342 --> 10:17.300
Oh, you're so screwed.

10:22.510 --> 10:23.830
Hey.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.266
What was that all about?

10:25.713 --> 10:28.788
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.

10:29.476 --> 10:31.469
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

10:31.639 --> 10:35.032
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be even worse for you. God.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.719
Well, just get ready
to do some serious crying.

10:38.285 --> 10:41.166
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.

10:42.209 --> 10:46.092
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.

10:47.014 --> 10:51.535
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.340
Mon. Okay.

10:57.505 --> 11:01.582
I better just say what it is
I'm gonna say.

11:04.391 --> 11:09.151
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last 10 years...

11:09.316 --> 11:11.514
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

11:13.681 --> 11:17.963
No one has been more like a sister
to me.

11:18.365 --> 11:20.119
I know what you mean.

11:20.287 --> 11:21.961
You're like a sister to me too.

11:27.374 --> 11:30.893
I don't know what I'm going to do
without you.

11:32.339 --> 11:35.095
You're the greatest friend I ever had.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.942
- Seeing you every day.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.861
What?

11:42.670 --> 11:45.061
I... I... I...

11:45.232 --> 11:48.672
- see you every day!

11:48.996 --> 11:51.148
That is so sweet!

11:57.444 --> 11:59.517
Oh, no, she took down Monica.

12:01.128 --> 12:03.405
And I'm the crier in the family.

12:05.052 --> 12:06.806
Oh, God, I could be next.

12:07.134 --> 12:10.447
Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're deep in conversation.

12:10.618 --> 12:12.770
Oh, so that thing you said
about the thing...

12:12.940 --> 12:15.331
...it really made me think
about that other thing.

12:15.503 --> 12:18.144
- Rach?
- Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.583
I really made you think
about that thing, huh?

12:25.072 --> 12:28.830
Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.

12:32.560 --> 12:37.878
I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh
at your weird jokes that I don't get.

12:39.166 --> 12:42.560
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.

12:42.730 --> 12:45.371
These aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with...

12:45.533 --> 12:47.047
Don't say Richard.

12:48.736 --> 12:52.129
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?

12:52.299 --> 12:55.453
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.220
- Pheebs!
- Yeah!

13:00.267 --> 13:01.861
I think these are yours.

13:02.910 --> 13:07.146
These are not mine.
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

13:08.796 --> 13:11.996
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...

13:12.159 --> 13:15.120
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

13:16.123 --> 13:18.845
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

13:21.929 --> 13:25.447
You don't really handcuff guys
to water pipes do you?

13:25.613 --> 13:28.254
Where do you think Mike really is?

13:36.944 --> 13:38.219
Oh, honey...

13:38.385 --> 13:41.221
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...

13:41.388 --> 13:45.146
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.916
I just want to say that l...
I love you.

13:51.719 --> 13:54.189
And I'm gonna miss you.

13:54.922 --> 13:57.438
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

13:59.927 --> 14:01.999
Oh, you know what?

14:03.090 --> 14:05.367
Let's not say anything else.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.172
I love you.

14:09.136 --> 14:10.456
Not so tight.

14:13.701 --> 14:15.773
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
- Okay.

14:15.943 --> 14:17.537
Okay.

14:19.426 --> 14:23.822
I'm sorry. Just go. Just go.
I can't. I can't.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.837
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.

14:31.999 --> 14:35.518
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.

14:35.683 --> 14:37.880
You cried yesterday
at the 6:00 news.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.279
That old woman was being scammed
by her mechanic.

14:42.690 --> 14:45.730
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.

14:45.893 --> 14:47.567
Why are they taking so long?

14:47.735 --> 14:52.130
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems
to be handling it surprisingly well.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.575
- No!
- No! Joey!

15:05.032 --> 15:07.264
Okay, here we go.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.999
- Well...
- Yeah.

15:13.841 --> 15:16.038
I think I'm gonna take off.

15:20.367 --> 15:24.410
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing
night. Thank you so much.

15:24.572 --> 15:26.131
I love you.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.887
Good night.

15:31.779 --> 15:33.372
What?!

15:36.303 --> 15:38.581
I don't get a goodbye?

15:38.746 --> 15:40.579
Lucky bastard.

15:47.675 --> 15:50.909
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

15:51.078 --> 15:54.312
Well, maybe she thought that
with all of your history, it could be...

15:54.481 --> 15:58.559
...you know, implicit.
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."

15:58.726 --> 16:02.165
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

16:02.329 --> 16:06.167
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.807
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.

16:09.977 --> 16:11.810
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.

16:11.979 --> 16:13.937
- Mine was a humdinger.
- Okay!

16:15.583 --> 16:20.742
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

16:22.790 --> 16:25.067
Not from you!

16:26.153 --> 16:28.909
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.

16:29.076 --> 16:31.433
And say what?
You owe me a goodbye?

16:31.599 --> 16:34.878
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!

16:38.686 --> 16:40.963
- I don't get a goodbye?
- What?

16:41.128 --> 16:45.250
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

16:45.412 --> 16:48.373
Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?

16:48.536 --> 16:49.890
Have a baby with you?

16:50.057 --> 16:53.257
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!

16:53.701 --> 16:55.739
- Ross...
- Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

16:55.903 --> 17:00.378
...enough credit. I mean, it is difficult
to say goodbye to five people.

17:00.548 --> 17:03.303
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, g...

17:03.470 --> 17:05.224
It's physically impossible!

17:08.275 --> 17:10.587
You know what?
After all we've been through...

17:10.758 --> 17:13.878
...I can't believe this is how
you want to leave things between us.

17:14.041 --> 17:16.193
Have a good time in Paris.

17:21.128 --> 17:24.203
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...

17:24.371 --> 17:26.284
...than I am.
- Tell me about it.

17:26.453 --> 17:29.254
Well, you can't say
we don't know how to throw a party.

17:30.177 --> 17:32.090
I think I'm gonna head out.

17:33.060 --> 17:36.659
- Where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...

17:36.824 --> 17:39.739
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.

17:40.828 --> 17:43.504
We're moving,
and we got a lot of packing to do.

17:43.671 --> 17:47.634
- It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.

17:47.795 --> 17:49.468
Yeah, good idea.

17:50.718 --> 17:53.029
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.956
You couldn't be cool.

17:57.525 --> 17:59.039
We're gonna start in the kitchen.

17:59.206 --> 18:02.201
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.

18:02.369 --> 18:06.161
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?

18:06.333 --> 18:08.166
- Yeah.
- Good. I need you to be careful...

18:08.335 --> 18:10.898
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...

18:11.058 --> 18:13.780
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.

18:15.823 --> 18:18.704
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
whose handcuffs they are.

18:18.866 --> 18:21.462
- You did? How?
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...

18:21.629 --> 18:23.906
...and I found some pictures of them...

18:24.071 --> 18:27.829
...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.877
Who's that dirty old lady?

18:32.359 --> 18:33.760
Monica's grandmother.

18:35.162 --> 18:38.636
Oh, my God.
Nana liked it rough!

18:40.167 --> 18:41.807
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:41.969 --> 18:43.289
- Oh, here, have a seat.
- Yeah.

18:43.450 --> 18:45.329
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.134
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.528
We went to this place that had...

18:55.743 --> 18:59.182
Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

19:01.869 --> 19:04.989
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

19:05.152 --> 19:09.673
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.

19:11.398 --> 19:15.635
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

19:16.163 --> 19:18.555
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

19:18.726 --> 19:21.083
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!

19:21.248 --> 19:25.040
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

19:25.212 --> 19:27.649
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.095
We're gonna have a baby!

19:30.257 --> 19:32.250
Oh, my God,
we're gonna have a baby!

19:32.419 --> 19:35.494
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!

19:37.144 --> 19:40.538
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.

19:40.948 --> 19:43.624
Okay. Okay.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.191
Okay, I feel a little better.

19:46.473 --> 19:48.147
Are you sure?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.867
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.

19:52.039 --> 19:53.997
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, bye, everyone!

19:54.161 --> 19:55.642
- We're having a baby!
- Good luck!

19:55.803 --> 19:57.523
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

19:57.685 --> 20:01.044
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

20:08.295 --> 20:11.131
You think I didn't say goodbye
to you because I don't care?

20:11.298 --> 20:12.779
That's what it seemed like.

20:12.940 --> 20:17.460
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!

20:17.625 --> 20:22.704
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

20:22.870 --> 20:27.311
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.

20:27.915 --> 20:31.958
When I think about not seeing you
every day, it makes me not want to go.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.761
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...

20:35.923 --> 20:39.556
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

20:39.727 --> 20:42.368
It's because you mean more to me.

20:42.530 --> 20:44.887
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!

20:45.332 --> 20:46.687
- Rach!
- What?

20:46.854 --> 20:48.972
- You keep... You can't...
- What?

21:09.877 --> 21:12.029
- A little more.
- Okay.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.197
- A little more. A little more.
- All right.

21:16.524 --> 21:18.676
Little more.

21:20.768 --> 21:23.330
- All right. All right, let's do this.
- All right, ready?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.961
Yep. Now give me your best shot.

21:26.694 --> 21:28.926
All right. Here goes.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.053
Doesn't work.

21:38.385 --> 21:40.378
