WEBVTT

00:05.305 --> 00:09.036
-What are you doing?
-I reorganized the fridge.

00:09.309 --> 00:12.767
See? Bottom shelf,
meats and dairy.

00:13.313 --> 00:16.282
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

00:16.549 --> 00:20.144
And top shelf, expired products.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.415
Why are you doing this?

00:22.655 --> 00:24.816
Because I'm bored out of my mind.

00:25.091 --> 00:28.891
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.

00:29.129 --> 00:32.565
Dude, you just described
seven days' worth of stuff.

00:32.966 --> 00:36.493
Spread it out a little.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?

00:36.770 --> 00:39.000
I'm not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.139
Hey, don't get religious
on me, okay?

00:42.909 --> 00:46.777
A guy in your position needs to be
better at relaxing.

00:47.013 --> 00:50.471
That's why we have comfortable chairs.
Here, sit down.

00:52.819 --> 00:53.945
Ready? Watch.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.781
And then....

01:00.160 --> 01:02.287
-So, what? We just sit?
-Oh, no, no.

01:02.529 --> 01:05.692
We're not gonna just sit.
Watch.

01:08.868 --> 01:12.065
-Hello, Chandler Bing.
-Hello, Mr. Bing.

01:12.205 --> 01:14.196
I love you.

01:14.974 --> 01:17.807
All right, whoever this is,
stop calling me!

01:19.779 --> 01:22.179
It's been 6 months!
It's not funny!

01:23.917 --> 01:27.512
I can see you, Mr. Bing.

01:27.654 --> 01:30.623
You look sexy in your new suit.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.521
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!

01:34.260 --> 01:35.989
And that's Wednesday.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.794
The One with
The lnappropriate Sister

02:25.645 --> 02:27.909
Hey, you guys! Guess what?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.349
The British are coming?

02:34.187 --> 02:36.087
Oh, you and your ways.

02:37.991 --> 02:42.257
Since it's Christmas,
I'm going to be collecting donations.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.521
I have my bell
and later on I get my bucket.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.660
I'll be spreading joy
to the people.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.872
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.700
So this year I'm doing the whole city.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.746
I knew a girl in high school who
did that. She was very popular.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.178
It's weird, you're starting to sound
a lot like Chandler lately.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.150
That is so not true.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.286
So, Phoebe, where are you
doing your bell-ringing?

03:13.560 --> 03:16.154
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.796
They never give a good spot
to a rookie...

03:18.998 --> 03:23.560
...but I'm the only one who can say
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.231
I lied!

03:26.539 --> 03:28.564
Oh, my God. Here's Danny.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.673
Just watch this.

03:33.479 --> 03:37.074
See? Still pretending
he's not interested.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.249
He's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.054
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Danny.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.155
Oh, Danny! Hey!

03:49.929 --> 03:54.491
You know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?

03:54.734 --> 03:55.826
Thanks, Mon.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.695
Of course.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.664
Do you want to go out
on a date with her?

04:02.108 --> 04:04.440
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?

04:06.279 --> 04:08.440
Friday is perfect.
She can't wait.

04:09.115 --> 04:12.380
On the date, I'll be able
to talk to her directly?

04:13.286 --> 04:14.378
See you Friday.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.788
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.958
I have a date with Danny!

04:23.596 --> 04:27.862
All right, it's 4:30,
I guess my lunch break is over.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.566
-What are you guys gonna do?
-lf you're going back to work...

04:31.704 --> 04:35.071
...I'll probably just hang out.
You know, make some calls.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.114
How could I not get the part?

04:43.316 --> 04:47.116
The play was about a 29-year-old
ltalian actor from Queens!

04:47.320 --> 04:50.346
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.217
She's a woman!

04:52.892 --> 04:55.725
What can I say? She nailed it!

04:58.464 --> 05:00.125
Is there anything else?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.631
You'll just say no again, but...

05:02.902 --> 05:04.369
...gay porn?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.706
Happy holidays!

05:09.008 --> 05:10.805
Feliz Navidad!

05:11.744 --> 05:14.076
Allo and Merry Christmas!

05:14.347 --> 05:16.872
Oh, thank you, sir!
Here's some joy.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.878
-How's it going?
-It's going okay.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.020
Good. Let me help you out.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.485
Oh, thanks!

05:28.428 --> 05:31.829
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.893
Yeah. I guess.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.567
Just get your nails done?

05:40.673 --> 05:43.608
Yes, Phoebe, but this
is all I have, okay?

05:43.876 --> 05:46.845
Thanks. Happy holidays!
Here's your joy.

05:47.714 --> 05:50.239
Thank you! Happy holidays and
Wait.

05:50.516 --> 05:54.111
-You can't take money out.
-I'm making change for the bus.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.914
Can't you leave the
dollar for the poor?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.283
I'm poor.
I gotta take the bus.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.458
Okay, season's greetings and everything,
but still

06:02.695 --> 06:03.889
Bite me, blondie!

06:06.966 --> 06:11.027
I'm going to give him
something besides joy. Just

06:15.141 --> 06:18.167
I can't believe
I didn't get that part.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.605
I'm sorry, man.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.513
What you should do...

06:22.782 --> 06:25.307
...is make something happen
for yourself.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.748
You know, like write a play.

06:28.020 --> 06:31.512
Or a movie. What about those
Good Will Hunting guys?

06:31.791 --> 06:35.522
Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something...

06:35.795 --> 06:39.424
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?

06:42.502 --> 06:44.527
Wait a second.
I could star in it!

06:44.804 --> 06:45.793
Or that.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.641
I can't write.
I mean, I'm an actor.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.905
I could act like a writer. Here....

06:59.485 --> 07:01.783
But see? Nada.

07:02.889 --> 07:06.484
I don't have the discipline
that it takes. I can't do it.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.384
I'll help you.

07:08.628 --> 07:12.724
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.229
Plus, it'll give me something to do.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.766
You'd do that for me?
Thanks.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.337
We'll start slow. All you have
to come up with tonight...

07:21.641 --> 07:24.007
...is the name
of your main character.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.406
-Done.
-And it can't be Joey.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.340
-It's not.
-Or Joseph.

07:35.488 --> 07:36.477
What's up?

07:36.689 --> 07:39.681
I just saw Danny on the subway
with a girl...

07:39.892 --> 07:41.757
...and he had his arm
around her.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.320
Honey, I'm sorry.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.928
You should be.
This is all your fault.

07:47.533 --> 07:50.400
You meddled in our relationship!

07:50.670 --> 07:52.365
You had no relationship!

07:52.605 --> 07:55.096
But I was doing my thing
and everything...

07:55.341 --> 07:57.400
...was going according to the plan!

07:57.610 --> 08:00.670
Oh, God, stop with the plan!

08:02.114 --> 08:04.241
So what if you saw him
with a girl?

08:04.450 --> 08:06.350
That doesn't mean anything.

08:06.552 --> 08:11.080
You'll go out with Danny and be
so charming he'll forget all about...

08:11.290 --> 08:13.417
...that stupid subway girl.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.718
She was kind of stupid.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.929
You're right.
I'm just going to go on the date.

08:20.199 --> 08:24.533
I'm just going to go on the date.
That is the new plan.

08:26.472 --> 08:27.632
Hurry!

08:42.655 --> 08:46.091
-How do you spell "suspicious"?
-Why?

08:46.392 --> 08:50.089
I think this character is going
to be suspicious about stuff.

08:53.933 --> 08:57.164
Chandler Bing, seven!
Chandler Bing, zero!

08:58.271 --> 08:59.932
You're driving me crazy with that.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.902
-I'll stop.
-Don't stop.

09:02.141 --> 09:05.770
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.651
Well, you suck. But at least you suck
at a man's game now.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.785
-Want to play?
-I can't play games.

09:17.990 --> 09:22.290
Ross'll be home soon. I have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.

09:22.528 --> 09:26.123
So play for 30 minutes,
then write until he gets home.

09:26.866 --> 09:27.855
All right.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.829
But listen, what do you say we...

09:32.104 --> 09:33.799
...crank it up a notch?

09:34.206 --> 09:35.195
I'm intrigued.

09:36.008 --> 09:39.034
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.

09:39.278 --> 09:42.372
But be careful.
I want our security deposit back.

09:42.648 --> 09:46.448
We said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.

09:47.186 --> 09:51.054
Do you even remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?

09:55.127 --> 09:57.027
Thank you! Happy holiday.

10:00.299 --> 10:03.393
No, that's trash, young lady.
You can't

10:03.636 --> 10:06.833
Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!

10:10.910 --> 10:12.901
The charity's on fire!

10:13.145 --> 10:15.477
Help!
Thank you. I need that!

10:16.983 --> 10:18.712
What is this?

10:18.851 --> 10:21.479
It's 9:00 in the morning!

10:22.555 --> 10:25.046
All right. "A room.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.849
A man enters. He looks suspicious."

10:32.598 --> 10:34.122
That's it?

10:35.101 --> 10:38.161
You're supposed to
have five pages done by now...

10:38.371 --> 10:40.566
...including an exciting incident.

10:42.608 --> 10:47.204
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."

10:48.347 --> 10:50.042
That's the game we played.

10:50.249 --> 10:54.686
It's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter

10:57.556 --> 11:00.957
This is helping your career?
You wanted to be an actor.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.458
Not the creator of
"Crazy Lawsuit Game."

11:04.730 --> 11:06.925
You're right.
I'll get back to work.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.760
Shame on you! You should know better!
Joey needs to work.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.904
Now come on.

11:14.306 --> 11:17.571
You can have this back
when the five pages are done.

11:29.488 --> 11:32.252
-I had a nice time tonight.
-So did l.

11:32.458 --> 11:35.325
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.228
I'd love to ask you in,
but my sister's visiting.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.773
-I think she's asleep on the couch.
-Your sister?

11:51.010 --> 11:53.444
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

11:53.746 --> 11:58.843
I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch!

12:00.152 --> 12:03.087
-I thought I heard you.
-Hey, great, you're up.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.414
Rachel, my sister Krista.

12:05.658 --> 12:06.818
Nice to meet you.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.926
I wish you'd warned me.
I'd have fixed myself up.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.029
-Like it would help.
-You are so bad.

12:13.265 --> 12:14.323
-You are.
-You are.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.000
-You are.
-You are!

12:17.269 --> 12:18.702
You are so dead.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.099
I'm gonna get you.
Come here!

12:30.116 --> 12:32.209
It's very nice to meet you.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.058
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!

12:41.594 --> 12:44.757
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here!

12:44.964 --> 12:48.058
Does this look like a
garbage can to you?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.461
Does it look like an ashtray?

12:50.669 --> 12:52.830
Does it look like a urinal?

12:54.673 --> 12:59.007
-So you going back out there?
-Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.678
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

13:03.482 --> 13:06.246
Good. You're tough.
You lived on the street.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.920
I'll go back to being
Street Phoebe.

13:10.289 --> 13:15.317
But not totally back. Street Phoebe
wouldn't be friends with you guys.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.489
Can I ask you guys something?

13:21.767 --> 13:26.466
I don't have brothers, so I don't know,
but did you guys wrestle?

13:26.672 --> 13:28.299
-Oh, yeah.
-All the time.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.271
In fact, I was undefeated.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.776
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.808
Still, I was quick as a cat.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.316
I met Danny's sister yesterday.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.854
-That was the girl on the subway.
-You're kidding.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.322
They were very, you know...

13:48.727 --> 13:50.217
...wrestle-y.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.691
But I guess that's normal?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.795
We don't wrestle now.

13:57.069 --> 13:59.560
Not since I got too
strong for you.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.698
Too strong for me?

14:02.975 --> 14:04.738
You wanna go right now?

14:05.377 --> 14:08.540
I'll take you right now, buddy!
You wanna go?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.004
Oh, fine.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.546
Ready?

14:15.321 --> 14:16.652
Wrestle!

14:21.393 --> 14:22.826
Okay, you know what?

14:23.028 --> 14:25.588
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.561
Let's go!
The puck drops in 20 minutes!

14:33.939 --> 14:35.270
Joey's not going.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.771
I didn't finish my five pages.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.705
Finish them tomorrow.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.538
Tomorrow he's redoing
yesterday's pages.

14:43.782 --> 14:47.343
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.

14:47.853 --> 14:51.755
Cut him some slack. If he relaxes,
he'll get some work done.

14:52.024 --> 14:55.516
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...

14:55.794 --> 14:57.056
...and Fireball.

14:58.564 --> 15:02.557
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
you've never played.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.526
You're doing this
because you're bored.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.898
It's not his fault
you're unemployed.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.768
I am not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical!

15:11.810 --> 15:13.402
Guys, don't fight.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.082
And I'm doing this because
I am Joey's friend.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.285
If you were a friend,
you'd be doing the same.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.713
So being a friend means
being a jerk?

15:22.955 --> 15:26.118
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.150
Let's settle this
over a game of Fireball.

15:29.395 --> 15:34.059
-I'll unhook the smoke detectors.
-Let's settle this right now.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.565
There. Now no one's going
to the game.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.438
-I paid for those!
-You said you would, but you didn't.

15:42.641 --> 15:43.869
Oh, yeah.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.447
We finally get
to the top of the mountain...

15:53.652 --> 15:56.587
...and airhead here
forgets the camera.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.689
The same thing
happened to me one time.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.661
When did that happen to you?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.622
Remember? We were jogging
and saw that bird.

16:07.833 --> 16:11.200
I wanted to take a picture,
but I didn't have my camera.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.201
Chasing the churro
guy is not jogging.

16:15.874 --> 16:19.139
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.

16:30.189 --> 16:34.125
-Damn. I got it on my pants.
-Here, I'll get it.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.662
We better take them off
or the stain will set.

16:44.870 --> 16:48.067
-I want to wear them tonight.
-Oh, great.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.299
Okay, bye. Oh, my God!

16:52.978 --> 16:55.572
-That was unbelievable.
-See? I told you.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.145
Yeah. Sorry.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.146
I don't believe they're
brother and sister.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.410
They're brother and sister?!

17:02.755 --> 17:04.620
I guess you'll have to cancel your date.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.282
And call their mother.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.767
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.

17:23.075 --> 17:26.943
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.506
What's this?
A Canadian coin?

17:29.748 --> 17:31.739
Get out of here!

17:34.953 --> 17:37.114
No drinks near the bucket.

17:37.389 --> 17:41.120
Set it down there and then
you can make a contribution.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.894
You can leave the "hurt bunny"
look over there too.

17:45.697 --> 17:46.755
Hi, Bob.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.459
I thought I told you
to get out of here!

17:51.603 --> 17:54.094
Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.

17:54.373 --> 17:57.604
We're moving you to a
less high-profile spot.

17:58.277 --> 18:02.611
-Ginger's taking this corner.
-That chick can't handle my corner.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.244
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.

18:06.819 --> 18:07.808
Fine.

18:14.393 --> 18:18.090
I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.

18:27.806 --> 18:32.573
-I thought we said 7.
-You know what? Let's skip it.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.472
What? Why?

18:35.247 --> 18:39.115
You and your sister seem to have
a very special bond

18:39.318 --> 18:42.947
Oh, great.
That "special bond" again.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.653
Why do women have a problem
with my being close to my sister?

18:48.861 --> 18:52.456
-I don't know, but
-Do you have brothers?

18:52.764 --> 18:57.667
No, I have two sisters. But one
has a very masculine energy.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.797
-Are you close?
-No. They're not very nice people.

19:04.543 --> 19:07.478
I like you.
I think this could go somewhere.

19:07.679 --> 19:11.672
So I'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.180
Well, I don't know....

19:14.720 --> 19:16.711
When you put it that way

19:16.955 --> 19:20.447
Danny? Hurry up.
The bath's getting cold.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.027
I'll see you later.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.569
There's some kids
playing in the street.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.172
Want to go give them a project,
ruin their day?

19:37.643 --> 19:41.044
If they have a ball,
you could stick razors in it...

19:41.246 --> 19:44.841
...and teach them a new game:
"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."

19:46.151 --> 19:51.088
Hey, guys! I was at the library.
I already finished my five pages.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.588
Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night!

19:56.161 --> 19:59.255
No, dude.
Ross tore up the tickets.

20:03.769 --> 20:08.433
I guess without so many distractions
it's easier for you to focus?

20:08.740 --> 20:13.768
Also without somebody breathing
down your neck all the livelong day!

20:15.347 --> 20:19.943
The important thing is, I finished it.
And I think it's really good.

20:20.252 --> 20:24.621
But it would help if I could hear it.
Would you guys read it for me?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.748
-Yeah, all right.
-All right.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.394
"It's a typical New York apartment.

20:32.631 --> 20:35.566
Two guys are hanging out."

20:38.937 --> 20:39.926
"Hey, man."

20:40.906 --> 20:42.430
"What is up?"

20:44.042 --> 20:47.808
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."

20:48.113 --> 20:51.549
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."

20:51.750 --> 20:56.119
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter

20:59.057 --> 21:03.426
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart."

21:03.795 --> 21:05.990
"Could I be more sorry?"

21:11.570 --> 21:14.562
"l don't know. I am one sorry...

21:15.274 --> 21:17.572
...polontologist."

21:21.613 --> 21:23.478
All right, Joey, we get it.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.442
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.519
Keep reading.
The good part's coming up.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.116
"l am sorry, Chandler."

21:35.327 --> 21:37.522
"l am sorry, Ross."

21:39.631 --> 21:41.997
"A handsome man enters."

21:45.304 --> 21:50.264
"l don't know what you're talking
about, but I'd like to thank you both.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.137
You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.710
And you.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.948
You co-created Fireball."

21:58.884 --> 22:00.374
"The End."

22:01.687 --> 22:03.814
This took you all day?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.957
No, this took five minutes.

22:07.192 --> 22:12.027
I spent the rest of the day coming up
with new Ultimate Fireball!

22:17.102 --> 22:22.904
It's a typical New York apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out. Go.

22:23.642 --> 22:27.237
-"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
-"I'm doing just fine.

22:27.479 --> 22:30.243
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."

22:32.417 --> 22:33.816
"It's my new perfume.

22:34.086 --> 22:38.489
Why don't you come closer where
you can really appreciate it?"

22:41.026 --> 22:43.620
-Joey, you are sick.
-This is disgusting.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.763
I'm not reading this.

22:45.964 --> 22:50.025
Wait, wait, wait!
The handsome man was about to enter!
