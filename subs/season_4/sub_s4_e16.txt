WEBVTT

00:09.409 --> 00:12.105
Cereal killer.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.110
Cereal killer?

00:14.280 --> 00:16.646
Hey, come on, I say more
dumb things before 9 a.m...

00:16.816 --> 00:19.250
...than most people say all day.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.043
What?

00:22.255 --> 00:26.248
I can't find anything that I wanna eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.326
I'm telling you, being pregnant
is no piece of cake. Oh, cake!

00:30.897 --> 00:31.886
No.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.198
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.203
What is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

00:40.807 --> 00:43.799
Pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

00:44.811 --> 00:49.214
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen, there's
something in here I want to eat.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.641
What smells so good?

00:53.586 --> 00:56.885
-ls it the shampoo? It's guava.
-No.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.390
Wait.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.720
Is it my bologna sandwich?

01:04.998 --> 01:06.727
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:06.966 --> 01:11.164
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants meat. I can't eat meat.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.733
Wait!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.598
Maybe it's the pickle!

01:16.609 --> 01:18.577
The One With the Fake Party

02:06.359 --> 02:07.451
What are you writing?

02:07.727 --> 02:11.959
Joshua's coming in tomorrow, and since
I don't have the guts to ask him out...

02:12.165 --> 02:15.657
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.629
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

02:20.907 --> 02:23.102
...never go out of style."

02:24.244 --> 02:26.235
What did you throw away?

02:28.515 --> 02:31.348
-Hi, guys.
-What have you guys been up to?

02:31.651 --> 02:35.815
We went to see a collection of
Victorian doorknobs at the museum.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.488
Without me?

02:39.225 --> 02:42.820
My uncle dragged us there,
but it turned out to be really interesting.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.031
They were so ornate and beautiful.
Look at that.

02:46.232 --> 02:50.692
I don't know how museums work in England,
but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.435
I got it from the gift shop.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.573
They have really lax security there.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.710
It's a joke.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.473
Anyone for more tea?

03:03.750 --> 03:06.014
No, just me then.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.980
Hey, Ringo.

03:09.489 --> 03:13.289
Every time Emily's around, you talk
like her. Would you please cut it out?

03:13.459 --> 03:16.485
I think you like it.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.496
I think you can't resist me when I do it.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.193
You want to eat me up
like a cream "pumpy."

03:24.771 --> 03:28.969
-What?
-All right, look, I don't know all the words.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.306
Right. I've got to be off.
I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.381
Bye-bye, then.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.653
You guys seem to be having a good time.

03:41.821 --> 03:45.917
She is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.855
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!

03:51.764 --> 03:55.222
I do things like run off to Vermont...

03:55.401 --> 03:58.234
...and you guys saw the doorknob.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.366
I even signed up
for helicopter classes.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.711
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.239
Two days?
You must be bummed.

04:09.449 --> 04:13.545
She's got to go back to London, but
I've been prepared for this from the start.

04:13.820 --> 04:17.483
We both knew we had two weeks together,
and then that's it.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.386
Hey, that's what all
my relationships are like.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.391
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.027
-Pheebs!
-Hello. Hello.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.226
No, I know. Yeah.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.572
So the baby is totally craving meat.

04:35.808 --> 04:40.404
I tried tricking it, and I made it a soy burger,
so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.511
And I got nauseous.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.976
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.651
But I'm no obstetrician....

04:50.757 --> 04:52.782
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.993
At least you got that
cool, pregnant-lady glow.

04:56.162 --> 04:59.290
That's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

05:07.740 --> 05:08.729
Okay.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.139
-Here's that trench coat that you wanted.
-Great.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.671
It's comfortable.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.815
You could really
flash somebody in this.

05:19.619 --> 05:24.352
No. They don't want you to put your hands in
the pockets until you are out of the store.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.618
Why not?

05:26.793 --> 05:28.420
Well, because...

05:28.728 --> 05:30.992
...we get a lot of

05:33.399 --> 05:35.026
They ruin it for everybody.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.496
I know.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.237
I wore that sweater
on a date last night.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.364
It was the first date
since the divorce.

05:44.143 --> 05:47.271
Congratulations.
So do you love her?

05:48.247 --> 05:51.045
She's nice,
but it made me realize...

05:51.284 --> 05:54.117
...I'm just not ready to be dating.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.750
That's interesting.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.021
-What was that?
-Just an anti-theft device.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.366
Then what's this?

06:08.634 --> 06:12.695
You need that too, because
a thief could just tear this up.

06:18.144 --> 06:22.911
We have to have a party in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.312
What's going on?

06:25.551 --> 06:28.543
We have to have
a bon-voyage party for Emily.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.380
But it's actually for Joshua.

06:30.790 --> 06:35.159
That sucks. Nobody's ever thrown me
a bon-voyage-Emily party.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.327
He said he's not ready to date.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.795
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside of work.

06:41.968 --> 06:46.667
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.707
As much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

06:52.678 --> 06:56.671
...Emily and I won't be here.
She's gonna come by to say goodbye...

06:56.883 --> 07:01.013
...and then I've got a special evening
planned. Sorry. No party.

07:03.856 --> 07:06.484
-Hello?
-Surprise!

07:08.027 --> 07:09.790
Surprise!

07:11.464 --> 07:14.092
No one's thrown me
a surprise party before.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.098
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.103
You're so sweet.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.308
And I'm so surprised.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.944
You didn't know?

07:39.325 --> 07:42.158
Why are you over here
if Joshua's over there?

07:42.428 --> 07:44.988
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.162
Quick! He's looking.
Say something funny.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.496
Like what?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.530
What's so funny?

07:56.509 --> 07:57.635
I said, "Like what?"

07:59.612 --> 08:01.136
Now that's a thinker.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.312
This playing-hard-to-get thing
is not working.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.746
Hand me those cherries.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.293
-Care for a cherry?
-No, thanks.

08:18.564 --> 08:22.625
I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.242
You okay?

08:37.884 --> 08:39.715
You all right?

08:44.323 --> 08:46.518
We should probably get going soon.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.351
But the party's just getting started.

08:49.562 --> 08:53.555
We have to be at The Four Seasons
for drinks in 15 minutes.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.597
Then The Plaza for dinner.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.429
So why did you plan a party
at the same time?

09:03.209 --> 09:07.305
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

09:07.547 --> 09:12.007
It's usually, "Surprise!"
Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye!"

09:14.186 --> 09:16.347
Ross, I'm having such a great time.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.549
Your sister told me that
you used to dress up like old ladies...

09:20.826 --> 09:23.260
...and host make-believe
tea parties.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.733
Monica said that, did she?

09:29.368 --> 09:32.235
Did she tell you
that when she was little...

09:32.405 --> 09:35.135
...she was partially responsible for
new legislation...

09:35.308 --> 09:39.438
...regulating the strength
of swing sets?

09:45.318 --> 09:48.549
Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

09:48.821 --> 09:52.257
-A little salami.
-Oh, yeah.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.720
What goes on top of the salami?

09:56.195 --> 09:57.184
Pastrami.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.158
You're a genius.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.666
Give me a hand with the zipper.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.671
Up!

10:14.747 --> 10:18.274
-You changed?
-I decided I needed my lucky dress.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.111
-Lucky means more cleavage?
-lt does for me.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.527
Look at him!
He's so cute.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.667
I just want to grab him and kiss him.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.565
How could I kiss him
without him knowing I like him?

10:40.840 --> 10:43.775
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.699
What?

10:45.911 --> 10:47.879
-This scene in Footloose
-Flashdance.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.615
-Yeah. With that plumber girl?
-A welder.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.949
Were you, like, in the movie?

10:58.357 --> 11:03.090
She takes off her bra under the shirt
and pulls it out the sleeve.

11:03.295 --> 11:06.059
Very sexy. And classy.

11:09.802 --> 11:13.602
-Or you could use mistletoe.
-It's not Christmas.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.636
-Spin-the-bottle.
-He's not 11.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.479
Thank you so much for this.
It was so thoughtful of you.

11:22.782 --> 11:23.942
You're leaving?

11:24.216 --> 11:27.947
-We have something we have to get to.
-I'm gonna take off too.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.952
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

11:31.223 --> 11:33.817
We've got the whole
big thing planned.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.552
What big thing?

11:35.795 --> 11:39.458
Spin-the-bottle works like this:
I spin the bottle.

11:39.665 --> 11:42.463
Lands on Gunther,
so I would have to kiss Gunther.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.630
All right.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.297
Who wants to go first?

11:48.507 --> 11:49.735
I'll go.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.572
Welcome to America.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.347
Oh, my God!

12:06.492 --> 12:09.188
Two in a row!
You gotta use your tongues now.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.299
All right.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.865
What are the odds?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.365
That's enough!

12:25.010 --> 12:27.535
Let's let someone else play.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.714
If you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?

12:33.786 --> 12:35.276
All right, I'll go.

12:36.322 --> 12:40.122
Somebody loose.
Somebody loose.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.759
Story of my life.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.630
Story of my father's life.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.831
Okay, my turn.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.436
Look at that!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.008
Oh, my God.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.517
The baby just kicked!

13:08.621 --> 13:11.715
It's okay. It's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!

13:15.628 --> 13:19.689
Everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.833
It was a bug.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.610
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

13:36.882 --> 13:40.215
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.

13:41.187 --> 13:42.984
Okay.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.192
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!

13:52.164 --> 13:53.495
What are you doing?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.825
I can't help it!

13:56.202 --> 13:59.035
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.033
You know when you're dating someone...

14:01.207 --> 14:04.233
...and you don't want to cheat
unless it's with someone really hot?

14:07.413 --> 14:08.402
Totally.

14:08.647 --> 14:11.810
This is the same kind of deal.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.246
If you're gonna do something wrong...

14:16.455 --> 14:17.444
...do it right.

14:20.759 --> 14:23.751
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.596
What are you doing to me?

14:27.099 --> 14:30.296
I'm trying to get Emily out of here,
and you keep talking to her...

14:30.469 --> 14:33.097
...being all interesting
and making her laugh.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.536
I don't want you to be funny anymore.

14:35.808 --> 14:39.676
Rachel wants me to be funny,
you don't want me to be funny.

14:39.845 --> 14:44.475
From now on, I'm gonna be funny
sometimes, and not funny others.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.015
You feel better now?

14:54.193 --> 14:56.218
Yeah, but at what cost?

14:57.263 --> 14:59.288
Six more months, three meals a day.

14:59.498 --> 15:03.434
I am going to eat, like,
you know, millions of cows.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.861
Mommy cows, daddy cows, baby cows

15:07.039 --> 15:11.203
No. No, I will never eat
baby cows. No veal!

15:11.377 --> 15:13.572
Oh, but veal.

15:15.281 --> 15:18.148
What if I even things out
for you, meat-wise?

15:18.417 --> 15:21.147
-What?
-I eat a lot of meat, right?

15:21.353 --> 15:24.880
But suppose, until the baby's born,
I laid off it.

15:25.157 --> 15:28.558
No extra animals would die.
You'd be eating my animals.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.054
I can't believe you'd do that for me.

15:32.364 --> 15:36.095
Absolutely.
I could be a vegetarian.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.926
There's no meat in beer, right?

15:39.538 --> 15:43.702
We can still make dinner if we skip the
appetizers and ask for our check right away.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.647
We can't go now.
Rachel is going to put on a skit.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.482
Oh, my God!
Have you lost your mind?

15:57.156 --> 15:59.920
I am finally thinking clearly.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.753
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.421
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.627
Wait, I can't let

16:10.903 --> 16:13.167
Actually, I want to see what happens.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.772
Nice costume.

16:20.512 --> 16:24.778
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.551
Ready. Okay.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.487
Give me an "E"!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.218
Give me an "M"!

16:36.495 --> 16:37.928
Give me an "I"!

16:38.130 --> 16:39.324
Give me an "L"!

16:39.498 --> 16:40.487
Give me a "Y"!

16:41.300 --> 16:43.564
What do you get?

16:44.236 --> 16:48.104
Emily! Emily!

16:51.977 --> 16:54.002
That's me as a cheerleader!

16:56.482 --> 16:59.815
I loosened a tooth.
It's no big deal. I have a dentist.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.519
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.517
-What do I do now?
-I think you're done.

17:09.495 --> 17:11.463
Time to take off the bra.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.762
That was really great.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.538
But I gotta take off.

17:20.806 --> 17:23.832
Take the bra off.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.938
Let's go get your coat.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.011
Rachel's my girlfriend.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.881
So this was really fun.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.888
Yeah, it was real fun.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.897
You know, this bra...

17:51.537 --> 17:54.028
...is really bothering me.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.134
This used to be my bedroom.

17:59.011 --> 18:03.209
A lot of memories in here.
Lot of memories.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.875
If these walls could talk,
they'd say:

18:06.085 --> 18:08.212
"Want to hear some memories?"

18:14.760 --> 18:16.193
Need a hand?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.362
I got this all under control.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.991
You really don't seem like you do.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.230
God! Forget it!

18:34.646 --> 18:37.672
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.247
What was supposed to happen?

18:41.353 --> 18:43.253
Can you not look at me
when I say this?

18:47.593 --> 18:51.051
I thought that
if I could get you here...

18:52.131 --> 18:54.929
...I could seduce you.

18:56.935 --> 19:00.393
-Excuse me?
-Seduce you.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.549
I don't wear suits to work.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.219
And I bought six of them from you.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.156
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

19:20.726 --> 19:24.753
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.022
-Why?
-Because I like you.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.696
You like me?

19:32.437 --> 19:37.170
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.878
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.837
But you like me?

19:44.183 --> 19:48.711
I can't believe this. All this time,
I liked you and you liked me!

19:50.489 --> 19:52.116
-But
-No "but."

19:52.357 --> 19:56.817
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "l like you and you like me."

19:58.096 --> 20:02.055
-Okay. However
-No, that's a fancy "but."

20:04.469 --> 20:08.530
My marriage, like, just ended.

20:08.807 --> 20:13.039
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.571
But....

20:18.083 --> 20:21.280
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.287
Okay.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.426
There you are.
I was looking for you.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.891
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.531
It's okay.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.503
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.104
It's too late to do
the stuff I had planned.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.946
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.042
Yeah.

20:54.786 --> 20:58.586
If it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.390
Helps a little.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.360
Is there room on that step
for a pathetic loser?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.362
Have a seat.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.271
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.446
It was just a two-week thing anyway.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.047
I just didn't want it
to end this way.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.717
Or maybe you didn't want it to end.

21:27.719 --> 21:29.380
What do you mean?

21:29.588 --> 21:31.818
You seem to really like her.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.020
I really do.

21:37.896 --> 21:42.026
But what am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.099
No commitment.

21:48.507 --> 21:53.171
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

21:53.445 --> 21:55.845
...asking to hear stories about you...

21:56.048 --> 21:58.676
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.943
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

22:02.754 --> 22:04.244
You think?

22:05.524 --> 22:10.188
You've got 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

22:10.395 --> 22:12.625
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

22:12.898 --> 22:16.095
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.263
You're right.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.608
Thanks.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.615
What photo album was it?

22:35.554 --> 22:38.182
I don't know. It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.051
Oh, my God!
Those weren't albino kids.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.287
That was computer camp!

22:52.304 --> 22:55.967
-You're a pathetic loser, right?
-Oh, yeah.

22:56.641 --> 22:57.869
Sit!

23:04.182 --> 23:05.410
Hi.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.015
Oh, my God. Joshua.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.381
Look...

23:10.689 --> 23:13.590
...all those things I said
about not being ready

23:13.859 --> 23:16.327
-They're not true?
-They're all true.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.064
But....

23:23.702 --> 23:25.067
I love that "but."

23:35.580 --> 23:38.481
Do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.615
Okay.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.253
Every time.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.260
-What do you got there?
-Pastrami.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.399
-You know what goes good with that?
-Corned beef.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.302
I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.347
-How about that smoked turkey?
-Okay.

24:13.151 --> 24:14.448
Oh, mama!

24:16.087 --> 24:18.578
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.459
If a cow died of natural causes,
I could have one of those, right?

24:24.863 --> 24:26.888
Not if I get there first.
