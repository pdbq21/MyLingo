WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.153
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

00:04.404 --> 00:07.198
<i>Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.</i>

00:07.448 --> 00:10.410
<i>Every time he tried to tell her,
something got in the way...</i>

00:10.660 --> 00:12.495
<i>...like cats, Italian guys.</i>

00:12.745 --> 00:15.832
<i>And finally, Chandler was,
like, "Forget about her."</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:20.670
<i>When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.</i>

00:20.920 --> 00:22.714
<i>She was, like, "Oh, my God!"</i>

00:22.964 --> 00:25.717
<i>So she went to the airport to meet him.</i>

00:25.967 --> 00:30.763
<i>She didn't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.</i>

00:31.014 --> 00:33.474
That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

00:33.725 --> 00:35.935
But enough about us.
How have you been?

00:36.186 --> 00:39.272
The One With Ross' New Girlfriend

01:21.541 --> 01:26.170
<i>Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.</i>

01:31.008 --> 01:32.552
Oh, my God!

01:32.802 --> 01:34.220
Oh, my God!

01:34.470 --> 01:35.263
Excuse me.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.057
Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

01:38.307 --> 01:41.269
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:48.568 --> 01:51.529
There you are!

01:53.114 --> 01:55.366
So, so...

01:55.616 --> 01:58.870
How was China? You!

01:59.120 --> 02:01.038
It was great.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.206
What happened?

02:02.457 --> 02:03.875
- You're bleeding.
- I am?

02:04.125 --> 02:06.002
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.713
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

02:08.963 --> 02:13.926
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

02:14.177 --> 02:16.679
Well, where do I start?

02:16.929 --> 02:21.392
This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

02:25.063 --> 02:25.855
These are...

02:26.105 --> 02:27.148
These are...

02:27.398 --> 02:30.109
...aren't for you.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.903
These are for you.

02:32.153 --> 02:36.407
Welcome to our country.

02:36.908 --> 02:41.746
Thank you. I'm from New York.

02:42.580 --> 02:46.793
No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

02:48.503 --> 02:50.880
Baggage claim?

02:57.095 --> 03:00.807
She went to the airport, and
she's gonna go for it with Ross.

03:01.057 --> 03:05.103
Oh, my God! This is huge!

03:05.353 --> 03:07.522
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

03:07.772 --> 03:11.567
All right, what's bigger than huge?

03:11.859 --> 03:14.362
This?

03:14.445 --> 03:15.863
Guys, you got new haircuts!

03:16.114 --> 03:19.992
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

03:20.243 --> 03:23.955
Because, you know, "If you don't
look good, we don't look good."

03:24.205 --> 03:26.499
I love that voice!

03:26.500 --> 03:27.500
And the winner is Ava Gardner!

03:32.059 --> 03:34.437
You guys!

03:34.603 --> 03:37.481
Airport. Airport. Ross.

03:37.732 --> 03:38.733
Not alone.

03:38.983 --> 03:40.359
Julie.

03:40.609 --> 03:42.695
Arm around her!

03:42.945 --> 03:45.781
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

03:46.032 --> 03:48.534
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

03:48.784 --> 03:51.245
Quick, get the verbs.

03:51.495 --> 03:53.205
You! You!

03:53.456 --> 03:55.416
You said he liked me!

03:55.666 --> 03:56.542
You!

03:56.792 --> 03:59.211
You slowpokes!

03:59.462 --> 04:03.591
That's all right.
We got the bags.

04:05.676 --> 04:07.845
This is my sister, Monica.

04:08.095 --> 04:09.388
This is Chandler.

04:09.639 --> 04:10.723
Phoebe, hi.

04:10.973 --> 04:13.142
Joey.

04:13.392 --> 04:15.478
Everyone, this is Julie.

04:15.728 --> 04:18.105
Julie.

04:22.943 --> 04:24.862
But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

04:25.112 --> 04:28.950
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.369
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

04:31.619 --> 04:33.746
- With the screaming guy...
- And the spitting.

04:33.996 --> 04:35.498
You gotta hear this story.

04:35.748 --> 04:38.084
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

04:38.334 --> 04:39.585
Two hundred, at least.

04:39.835 --> 04:43.297
And the chicken poops in her lap!

04:48.844 --> 04:50.680
I'm so sorry.

04:50.930 --> 04:52.974
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

04:53.224 --> 04:55.559
I just heard this story in the cab...

04:55.810 --> 05:01.023
...and it is all I can think about.

05:01.857 --> 05:04.819
This is amazing.

05:04.819 --> 05:05.945
How did this happen?

05:06.195 --> 05:07.822
We were in grad school together.

05:08.072 --> 05:11.325
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

05:11.575 --> 05:13.411
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

05:13.661 --> 05:16.330
Julie!

05:16.455 --> 05:18.207
Isn't that great?

05:18.457 --> 05:24.547
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

05:25.131 --> 05:27.675
It's an expression.

05:28.050 --> 05:30.261
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

05:30.511 --> 05:33.180
- Then we'll see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

05:33.431 --> 05:35.308
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

05:35.558 --> 05:40.438
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

05:43.816 --> 05:46.611
Bye!

05:56.203 --> 05:58.831
- Can I get some coffee?
- Sure.

05:59.081 --> 06:00.708
- Did you talk to him yet?
- No.

06:00.958 --> 06:03.836
Then, no.

06:14.889 --> 06:17.350
What the hell happened to you in China?

06:17.600 --> 06:20.978
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

06:21.229 --> 06:22.355
I know I was.

06:22.605 --> 06:25.650
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

06:25.900 --> 06:30.571
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

06:30.821 --> 06:32.865
God?

06:33.115 --> 06:35.368
It was you, pal.

06:35.618 --> 06:38.996
Maybe it was God doing me.

06:39.646 --> 06:43.380
Aside from being almighty,
he's a wiz of voices.

06:43.821 --> 06:48.076
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

06:48.326 --> 06:50.370
And then I met Julie...

06:50.620 --> 06:52.497
...and we're having a great time.

06:52.747 --> 06:57.293
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

06:58.461 --> 07:01.297
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

07:01.547 --> 07:02.590
Your lemonade.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.468
I didn't order it.

07:05.718 --> 07:08.846
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

07:09.097 --> 07:13.059
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

07:13.851 --> 07:16.312
So what did you find out?

07:16.563 --> 07:17.897
He said...

07:18.147 --> 07:21.150
He said...

07:22.819 --> 07:25.071
They're having a great time.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.615
I'm sorry.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.535
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

07:30.785 --> 07:33.872
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

07:34.122 --> 07:37.792
...without any outside help whatsoever.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.295
How is that a silver lining?

07:40.545 --> 07:44.757
You have to really wanna see it.

07:48.887 --> 07:52.557
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

07:52.807 --> 07:54.309
Hey, Pheebs.

07:54.559 --> 07:57.896
You know what I'm thinking?

08:01.232 --> 08:02.817
How...

08:03.067 --> 08:05.653
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

08:05.904 --> 08:09.449
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

08:11.805 --> 08:13.033
Not even close?

08:13.299 --> 08:18.179
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

08:18.304 --> 08:19.889
So what were you thinking?

08:20.139 --> 08:25.102
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

08:25.353 --> 08:27.438
No.

08:27.688 --> 08:28.523
Why not?

08:28.773 --> 08:30.525
Because I'm just...

08:30.775 --> 08:34.153
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

08:34.403 --> 08:35.863
No, you're not.

08:36.114 --> 08:38.282
I know I'm not, but you are.

08:38.533 --> 08:42.578
I was trying to spare your feelings.

08:44.539 --> 08:45.414
Hold on.

08:45.665 --> 08:48.751
Ross, Julie for you.

08:54.816 --> 08:56.809
Excuse me.
Who gave her our phone number?

08:57.017 --> 09:00.817
Okay, well, who had the motive?

09:02.055 --> 09:04.285
Was it the actor?

09:04.491 --> 09:07.187
The chef? The masseuse?

09:07.394 --> 09:10.488
Or was it the guy who's dating her?

09:12.132 --> 09:13.997
Guy who's dating her.
Guy who's dating her.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.142
Anybody know a good tailor?

09:20.392 --> 09:21.810
You need clothes altered?

09:22.060 --> 09:26.022
No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

09:26.273 --> 09:29.317
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.445
He did my first suit when I was 15.

09:31.695 --> 09:34.030
No, wait, 16.

09:34.281 --> 09:38.744
No, excuse me, 15.

09:38.994 --> 09:42.748
All right, when was 1990?

09:43.665 --> 09:48.003
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

09:56.094 --> 09:57.846
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

09:58.096 --> 10:00.807
Okay, bye.

10:01.725 --> 10:05.479
That is so sweet.

10:07.647 --> 10:09.566
Okay. No, you hang up.

10:09.816 --> 10:12.569
No, you...

10:13.070 --> 10:17.157
One, two, three.

10:18.158 --> 10:19.368
You didn't hang up either.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.996
She didn't hang up.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.126
No, you hang up.

10:28.377 --> 10:32.172
You. You.

10:39.888 --> 10:43.642
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.644
Rachel.

10:45.894 --> 10:49.272
I'll just call her back.

10:49.272 --> 10:51.483
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.027
No, you hang up.

10:54.277 --> 10:55.696
How did this happen to me?

10:55.946 --> 10:58.782
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

10:59.032 --> 11:01.660
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

11:01.910 --> 11:05.872
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

11:06.123 --> 11:10.293
...this really great guy
that I can't have.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.921
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

11:13.171 --> 11:15.590
I know you did.

11:15.655 --> 11:17.145
You want to hit Chandler again?

11:19.041 --> 11:23.045
I'm just gonna deal with it.

11:24.714 --> 11:28.676
I gotta get out of here!

11:29.802 --> 11:34.724
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

11:38.477 --> 11:42.857
You know, I think I was 16.

11:44.284 --> 11:46.802
You know, I think I don't care.

11:47.399 --> 11:50.110
Please, just a little bit off the back.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.196
I'm still on "no."

11:54.156 --> 11:55.991
Morning.

11:56.241 --> 11:58.160
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

11:58.410 --> 12:03.123
No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

12:03.874 --> 12:04.708
What's going on?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.127
I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

12:07.377 --> 12:10.714
What stupid thing did you do?

12:15.849 --> 12:19.457
Paolo, now you've seen everybody
and, better yet, they've all seen you.

12:23.772 --> 12:25.482
How did this happen?

12:25.732 --> 12:27.817
I kind of ran into him last night.

12:28.068 --> 12:29.277
- Where?
- At his apartment.

12:29.527 --> 12:31.529
Is this juice?

12:31.780 --> 12:35.492
And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

12:35.742 --> 12:39.412
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

12:39.663 --> 12:42.165
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

12:42.415 --> 12:44.709
People do stupid things
when they're upset.

12:44.959 --> 12:49.589
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't...

12:52.217 --> 12:56.221
But this is about your horrible mistake.

12:59.683 --> 13:00.517
Sorry we're late.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.018
We were...

13:02.268 --> 13:05.814
Well, there was touching.

13:10.068 --> 13:12.445
Hey, Ross!

13:12.696 --> 13:15.323
What a...

13:15.573 --> 13:17.534
What are you doing here?

13:17.784 --> 13:20.287
I do Raquel!

13:26.042 --> 13:27.752
So he's back?

13:28.003 --> 13:30.547
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

13:30.797 --> 13:32.590
No, not a problem.

13:32.841 --> 13:35.176
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

13:35.427 --> 13:39.806
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

13:42.684 --> 13:46.104
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

13:46.354 --> 13:47.856
...my pants need to be altered.

13:48.106 --> 13:51.651
When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

13:51.901 --> 13:55.030
He'll know what it means.

13:55.864 --> 13:59.159
You sure he'll crack that code?

13:59.868 --> 14:04.372
It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

14:04.623 --> 14:06.750
All right.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.338
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

14:11.588 --> 14:14.758
...and all Monica about it.

14:15.008 --> 14:16.051
I promise.

14:16.301 --> 14:17.802
All right, let's see.

14:18.053 --> 14:23.224
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

14:23.475 --> 14:27.187
But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

14:39.449 --> 14:42.827
- That's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

14:43.078 --> 14:46.581
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

14:46.831 --> 14:49.793
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

14:50.043 --> 14:52.921
...doesn't trust a person.

14:53.171 --> 14:54.798
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:55.048 --> 14:58.635
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

14:58.885 --> 15:02.347
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

15:02.597 --> 15:06.768
This is how he wears it.

15:07.269 --> 15:08.353
How who wears it?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.814
Demi Moore.

15:11.064 --> 15:12.816
Demi Moore is not a "he."

15:13.066 --> 15:17.279
Well, he was a "he"
in <i>Arthur</i> and in <i>10</i>.

15:17.946 --> 15:19.406
That's Dudley Moore!

15:19.656 --> 15:23.910
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

15:24.286 --> 15:26.037
Oh, my God!

15:26.288 --> 15:28.373
Oh, God!

15:28.623 --> 15:30.917
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

15:31.167 --> 15:32.544
Which one is Demi Moore?

15:32.794 --> 15:37.549
She's the actress that was in
<i>Disclosure</i>, <i>Indecent Proposal</i>, <i>Ghost</i>!

15:37.799 --> 15:39.342
She's got gorgeous hair.

15:39.593 --> 15:40.953
I know!

15:41.654 --> 15:43.645
That's why I wanted to look like her!

15:45.925 --> 15:49.489
- You know, my mom's dead.
- Oh, my God!

15:57.203 --> 16:01.367
Well, this is what my butt
must looks like to a fly.

16:02.951 --> 16:04.995
How long do you want the cuffs?

16:05.245 --> 16:09.374
At least as long as I have the pants.

16:11.835 --> 16:14.963
I just got that.

16:16.965 --> 16:21.011
Now we'll do your inseam.

16:32.356 --> 16:34.399
How is she?

16:34.650 --> 16:37.569
It's too soon to tell.

16:37.820 --> 16:41.406
She's resting, which is a good sign.

16:41.657 --> 16:42.866
How's the hair?

16:43.117 --> 16:47.704
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

16:49.989 --> 16:53.778
- And there's nothing you can do?
- At this point, it's a waiting game.

16:56.122 --> 17:00.876
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

17:01.127 --> 17:02.586
Can we see her?

17:02.837 --> 17:06.090
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

17:06.340 --> 17:09.093
Ross, you come on in.

17:15.433 --> 17:16.809
Well, how you doing?

17:17.059 --> 17:17.893
I'm okay.

17:18.144 --> 17:20.646
That bad, huh?

17:20.729 --> 17:24.191
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

17:24.442 --> 17:27.528
It's one of my gifts.

17:31.323 --> 17:35.035
Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

17:35.286 --> 17:38.414
...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

17:38.664 --> 17:42.042
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

17:42.293 --> 17:44.211
...50 feet of crap...

17:44.462 --> 17:46.964
...then me.

17:47.214 --> 17:48.799
Tell Ross how you feel.

17:49.049 --> 17:52.052
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

17:52.303 --> 17:55.264
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

17:55.514 --> 17:59.226
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

17:59.477 --> 18:02.063
I don't know. I don't know.

18:02.313 --> 18:05.024
I've been with my share of women.

18:05.274 --> 18:08.903
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.863
But the point is...

18:11.113 --> 18:16.619
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

18:17.369 --> 18:20.164
Really?

18:25.336 --> 18:28.589
Yo, paisan!

18:29.757 --> 18:33.302
Can I talk to you for a sec?

18:35.179 --> 18:36.722
Your tailor...

18:36.972 --> 18:40.851
...is a very bad man!

18:41.435 --> 18:42.937
What are you talking about?

18:43.187 --> 18:46.649
Hey, what's going on?

18:49.985 --> 18:52.905
Joey's tailor...

18:55.199 --> 18:58.327
...took advantage of me.

18:59.286 --> 19:02.415
No way! I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

19:02.665 --> 19:04.709
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

19:04.959 --> 19:08.629
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

19:08.879 --> 19:10.548
What?

19:10.798 --> 19:13.968
Cupping.

19:15.386 --> 19:19.598
That's how they do pants!

19:19.598 --> 19:22.143
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

19:22.393 --> 19:27.982
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

19:29.191 --> 19:32.236
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

19:32.486 --> 19:36.115
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

19:41.704 --> 19:43.706
What's the matter with you?

19:43.956 --> 19:46.500
What?

19:48.544 --> 19:50.921
That's not?

19:55.801 --> 19:58.721
Oh, my God!

20:00.646 --> 20:02.632
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

20:09.727 --> 20:13.773
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

20:14.194 --> 20:17.382
Come on. It's not that bad.
You never know.

20:18.563 --> 20:20.273
Bell-bottoms came back in.

20:21.932 --> 20:23.559
I like it.

20:23.809 --> 20:26.812
I do. I think it's a 10!

20:28.730 --> 20:29.857
Thank you.

20:30.107 --> 20:31.608
My hair is very amused.

20:31.859 --> 20:34.653
Come on, things could be worse.

20:34.903 --> 20:39.658
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

20:40.158 --> 20:43.495
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

20:44.872 --> 20:46.331
Thank you.

20:46.582 --> 20:48.792
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

20:49.042 --> 20:50.127
Bye, Rach!

20:50.377 --> 20:51.920
Wait, are you leaving?

20:52.171 --> 20:54.673
That's what I meant by "bye."

20:54.923 --> 20:58.510
Can I talk to you for a sec?

21:00.846 --> 21:04.433
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

21:04.683 --> 21:07.769
That's okay.

21:10.349 --> 21:12.070
If your mechanic does it...

21:17.130 --> 21:19.549
What's going on?

21:19.924 --> 21:23.428
Well, okay, first of all...

21:23.678 --> 21:26.347
...Paolo and I are not back together.

21:26.598 --> 21:28.600
That was a stupid thing I did.

21:28.850 --> 21:31.895
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

21:32.145 --> 21:35.690
...well, I wouldn't.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.152
Second of all...

21:39.402 --> 21:41.905
What?

21:43.448 --> 21:47.202
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

21:47.452 --> 21:48.828
...I tell you what I think...

21:49.078 --> 21:51.539
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

21:51.789 --> 21:55.585
...and I look like
a complete idiot?

21:56.336 --> 21:59.505
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

21:59.756 --> 22:04.302
I hate him. I mean, I actually...
I physically hate him.

22:04.552 --> 22:05.720
I always have.

22:05.970 --> 22:10.558
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

22:10.808 --> 22:12.227
Really?

22:12.477 --> 22:15.271
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

22:15.522 --> 22:17.440
...and who gets how funny...

22:17.690 --> 22:20.193
...and sweet and amazing...

22:20.443 --> 22:23.446
...and adorable and sexy you are.

22:23.696 --> 22:27.325
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

22:27.575 --> 22:31.120
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

22:31.371 --> 22:34.332
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

22:34.582 --> 22:38.169
Like the way I do with Julie.

22:42.382 --> 22:46.386
Was there a "second of all"?

22:50.515 --> 22:55.228
No, I think that was the whole "all."

22:55.854 --> 22:58.565
I gotta go.

22:58.940 --> 23:01.734
Thanks.

23:07.824 --> 23:09.659
No, I swear to God, Dad!

23:09.909 --> 23:13.538
That's not how they measure pants!

23:19.152 --> 23:22.698
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

23:22.948 --> 23:25.325
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Really?

23:25.576 --> 23:28.912
- You wanna do it now?
- Great!

23:29.871 --> 23:32.040
See you.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.960
I just wanna make
really sure this time.

23:35.210 --> 23:40.424
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
<i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>, right?

23:40.674 --> 23:43.218
No.

23:45.262 --> 23:48.140
That's Roddy McDowall.

23:48.390 --> 23:53.103
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from <i>Planet of the Apes</i>.

23:54.563 --> 23:58.025
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
