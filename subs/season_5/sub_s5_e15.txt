WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:04.796
Chandler! Chandler!

00:08.375 --> 00:10.809
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

00:11.011 --> 00:14.037
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

00:15.315 --> 00:17.545
Listen, we had a good run.

00:17.884 --> 00:20.114
What was it?
Four, five months?

00:20.320 --> 00:23.380
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.388
-What are you doing?
-I am going on the lam.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.559
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.655
Hold on!

00:36.736 --> 00:38.328
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

00:40.740 --> 00:44.540
What the hell are you doing?

00:44.811 --> 00:45.800
What's going on?

00:46.079 --> 00:50.072
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.811
Dude, he's right there.

00:55.989 --> 00:59.083
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

00:59.392 --> 01:02.361
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

01:02.595 --> 01:06.361
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.324
I'm in love with her.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.397
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.671
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.609
My best friend and my sister!

01:28.755 --> 01:30.916
I cannot believe this!

01:33.193 --> 01:36.629
You guys want to probably
get some hugs in too. Big news!

01:38.131 --> 01:40.190
We've actually known for a while.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.799
What? You guys knew?

01:47.707 --> 01:49.698
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

01:49.976 --> 01:55.107
We were worried about you. We didn't
know how you were going to react.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.985
You were worried about me?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.589
You didn't know how I'd react?

02:06.726 --> 02:08.990
Okay. All right.

02:09.262 --> 02:13.289
Let's clear out of here and let
these lovebirds get back to business.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.299
I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.604
The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey

03:00.713 --> 03:02.442
You know what I just realized?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.116
If you guys have kids

03:04.384 --> 03:05.612
We're having kids?

03:05.785 --> 03:06.979
I call godfather!

03:08.855 --> 03:11.881
You can't just call godfather.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.025
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?

03:15.228 --> 03:17.696
Sure. If you cared enough
to call it first.

03:19.299 --> 03:23.565
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
-Big zero gravity moon steps.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.904
I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.801
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.706
Hey, Katie.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.309
This is Katie.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.871
You ready to go?

03:37.083 --> 03:38.880
I'll run to the bathroom.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.174
Where's lunch?

03:40.420 --> 03:42.217
I was thinking Chinese food.

03:42.488 --> 03:43.887
I love Chinese!

03:44.157 --> 03:46.717
How did you know I love Chinese?

03:50.430 --> 03:51.863
She is so cute.

03:52.098 --> 03:54.089
You could fit her
in your pocket.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.836
She could fit in that little pocket
inside the pocket.

04:00.773 --> 04:04.766
I don't know. I like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but....

04:05.011 --> 04:06.535
But what?

04:08.281 --> 04:10.181
She keeps punching me.

04:12.318 --> 04:15.116
In the cute, little
sweet way she just did?

04:15.355 --> 04:17.880
It's a lot harder than it looks.

04:19.025 --> 04:21.459
She's hurting me.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.657
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.865
What is Ben doing after preschool?

04:29.135 --> 04:33.367
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.301
Joey, come here.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.909
Honey, I know. This must be
really difficult for you, and

04:40.213 --> 04:41.840
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

04:53.593 --> 04:55.720
I brought you some housewarming gifts.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.361
Salt, so your life always has flavor.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.692
Bread, so you never go hungry.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.897
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.695
Because, well, you know.

05:08.541 --> 05:12.102
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.910
Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,
president of the tenants' committee.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.018
Ross Geller.
And this is my friend Phoebe.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.751
Mr. President.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.284
I came to talk to you
about Howard.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.229
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.

05:31.431 --> 05:36.300
Everyone who lives here is kicking in
$100 as a kind of a thank you.

05:36.602 --> 05:37.933
That's nice.

05:38.204 --> 05:39.694
Want to give me a check?

05:43.976 --> 05:46.444
Not now. You can
slip it under my door.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.408
No, it's not that.

05:48.648 --> 05:51.310
I just moved in.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.446
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.215
Yes, but I've lived here
for 25 minutes.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.119
Okay, I get it.

06:04.497 --> 06:09.161
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.801
I mean, I don't know Howard.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.665
Howard's the handyman.

06:15.775 --> 06:19.609
Yes, but to me, he's just "man."

06:20.313 --> 06:23.248
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.950
Welcome to the building.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.647
Can you believe that guy?

06:31.023 --> 06:33.253
I really like his glasses.

06:38.765 --> 06:42.030
So then President Steve
told everyone I was a cheapskate...

06:42.335 --> 06:44.303
...and now the whole building hates me.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.995
A little kid spit on my knee.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.206
And told me to wipe it off
with my $100 bill.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.810
You really should wipe it off
with something.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.506
You know what?

06:58.751 --> 07:01.982
I'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.

07:02.989 --> 07:07.153
And I'll sit them all down and
explain that I am not a bad guy.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.191
I am not a cheap guy.
I'm just a guy...

07:10.463 --> 07:12.693
...who stands up
for what he believes in.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.432
A man with principles.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.431
Sounds like a fun party.

07:19.539 --> 07:23.202
If you want them to like you,
why don't you just pay the $100?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.172
The party will cost you more.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.673
That doesn't matter!

07:27.213 --> 07:30.649
It's my principles!
We're talking about my principles!

07:31.050 --> 07:34.281
I thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.354
They'll like me once
they come to my awesome party.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.953
I gotta get some nametags.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.401
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.505
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.969
Don't put any ideas in her head.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.913
You do realize that those ideas
are probably already in Monica's head?

08:01.581 --> 08:03.048
Why?

08:04.383 --> 08:08.217
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.818
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

08:11.757 --> 08:15.591
Don't freak out! I'm telling you
something you already know.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.956
She left Richard because
he didn't want to have babies.

08:19.165 --> 08:24.034
And she is a woman. And she's
almost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.899
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.768
My friend who lives across
the hall and wants a lot of babies.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.178
And the new Monica
who I started to date.

08:34.413 --> 08:37.246
Now, who is to say what she wants?

08:38.284 --> 08:39.774
I'm right.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.786
Am I right?

08:43.556 --> 08:44.989
Oh, absolutely.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.125
I'm completely different from Richard.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.524
He's an eye doctor,
and I don't wear glasses.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.054
You're right.

08:54.433 --> 08:58.062
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.769
It's not different, is it?

09:01.073 --> 09:03.200
Not unless different
means "the same."

09:05.278 --> 09:09.374
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!

09:15.254 --> 09:18.223
You know, bread-stick fangs
are always funny.

09:18.457 --> 09:21.551
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!

09:24.597 --> 09:27.725
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.026
Look, I like you.
I really do. I like you a lot.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.472
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...

09:36.742 --> 09:41.907
...it feels like I'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very real bat!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.581
Like I could hurt you.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.651
Are you making fun of my size?

09:48.888 --> 09:52.824
Don't make fun of me
because of my size!

09:58.297 --> 10:00.060
Isn't this great?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.394
Couldn't you just
stay like this forever?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.174
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

10:10.443 --> 10:14.243
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.

10:15.514 --> 10:16.503
Are you okay?

10:17.016 --> 10:18.142
I'm cool.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.816
Casual.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.083
What are you doing?

10:22.488 --> 10:26.822
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girl that I'm seeing casually.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.154
Man, I knew it!
I knew you'd do this.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.319
What?

10:32.498 --> 10:36.093
Get all freaked out because
everybody was joking about marriage!

10:36.702 --> 10:39.762
Well, you do want
all that stuff, right?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.473
You know what I want?

10:41.674 --> 10:44.643
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!

10:46.112 --> 10:47.807
I do not have baby fever!

10:48.047 --> 10:50.880
You're obsessed
with babies and marriage...

10:51.183 --> 10:54.675
...and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.549
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!

11:01.027 --> 11:02.824
Have you lost your mind?

11:03.129 --> 11:07.293
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!

11:07.533 --> 11:11.993
I know you. I know the thoughts
that you have in your head.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.372
You don't know everything.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.076
Did you know I'm going out
with Rachel tonight instead of you?

11:18.310 --> 11:20.369
And that the only baby here is you?

11:20.579 --> 11:23.673
Did you know I can't even
look at you now?

11:26.218 --> 11:27.378
I did not know that.

11:33.059 --> 11:37.120
It'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me. This is fixable.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.387
-Yeah, sure.
-Absolutely.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.723
By me?

11:44.637 --> 11:47.572
Unless you make some big gesture.

11:47.740 --> 11:48.729
Big, though.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.498
The missus!

11:53.512 --> 11:55.742
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

11:56.916 --> 11:57.905
To go.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.686
I still don't want to talk to you.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.251
Tell me how to make things right.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.255
That's what we do.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.519
I mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and I do.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.195
And then you think I'm cute again.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.825
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.004
Figure this out for yourself.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.766
If you're afraid
of a real relationship...

12:22.975 --> 12:24.943
...then don't be in one.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.677
Howard! Howard! Howard!

13:18.197 --> 13:20.028
Hi, Ross!

13:21.267 --> 13:22.734
What are you doing here?

13:23.002 --> 13:26.665
I thought this was your party,
and it's a party for Howard.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.874
He's the sweetest little man.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.944
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.611
Oh, sure.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.038
You chipped in?

13:37.249 --> 13:38.739
Yeah, $100.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.910
I can't believe you gave him money.

13:42.121 --> 13:46.387
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

13:46.592 --> 13:47.889
But they didn't ask me.

13:48.427 --> 13:52.727
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.

13:53.465 --> 13:55.558
But you're making me look bad.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.931
No, I'm not! If anything,
I'm making you look better.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.539
They'll see you
talking to me. I'm a hit.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.209
Hey, Phoebe!

14:05.477 --> 14:07.035
Hey, Ross.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.609
Maybe you two could
switch apartments.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.443
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

14:12.718 --> 14:13.946
Think about it.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.451
Okay, my bad.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.107
You look big.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.478
Thanks, I've been working out.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.245
Listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

14:46.852 --> 14:49.013
But it's not obvious why.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.957
I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I put on some extra padding.

14:53.158 --> 14:57.356
If she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'll hit...

14:57.596 --> 15:00.121
...when I take away the Joey love?

15:02.701 --> 15:04.999
Oh, right. I forgot that you call it that.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.904
Hey, cute jacket.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.634
Thanks.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.074
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!

15:20.052 --> 15:24.455
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!

15:26.492 --> 15:28.960
You know what?
I gotta tell you...

15:29.228 --> 15:31.890
...I think you're the one
that is too much.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.231
Joey has the nicest friends.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.470
And the nicest girlfriend.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.907
You're so sweet!

15:44.009 --> 15:46.000
You're so sweet!

15:53.519 --> 15:55.419
She just kicked me.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.783
Aren't you going to do something?

16:04.263 --> 16:07.096
Do something or I'll walk
out that door right now.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.025
Are you going to?

16:33.192 --> 16:36.389
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.391
I'm talking you up to people.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.292
Give it some time, relax.
Get something to eat.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.870
What did you tell them about me?

16:48.140 --> 16:51.632
I told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.003
But you came off as the bad guy.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.342
I told it wrong.

16:58.851 --> 17:03.185
We should talk about that because
I don't understand what happened there.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.249
This cake is really good!

17:08.060 --> 17:09.493
Things are looking up.

17:09.728 --> 17:14.062
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!

17:17.703 --> 17:20.263
Who would do a thing like that?

17:26.178 --> 17:27.372
3B.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.615
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.580
Isn't it time you went home?

17:36.622 --> 17:39.455
Go back to 3B, 3B.

17:40.526 --> 17:44.394
Everyone, calm down!
I have something that I'd like to say.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.759
Who here likes Ross?

17:53.972 --> 17:55.530
Of course you don't like him.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.537
He didn't give you any money.

17:57.876 --> 18:01.209
He raised his own hand
when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"

18:01.647 --> 18:03.547
And he's wearing two nametags.

18:06.885 --> 18:10.821
I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,
I didn't like him at all.

18:13.058 --> 18:16.425
Once I got to know him,
I saw that he is really sweet...

18:16.728 --> 18:20.061
...and caring and very generous.

18:20.299 --> 18:24.099
All I'm saying is, don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.

18:24.336 --> 18:29.239
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?

18:29.475 --> 18:31.773
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.135
Lola?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.608
Mind-numbingly stupid.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.614
You guys. Gold digger,
cradle-robbing perv.

18:45.924 --> 18:49.121
So I think you all know what I mean.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.626
Obviously, I didn't think
they would throw things.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.705
I thought if I kept insulting them
you'd defend them.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.933
Then you'd look like the hero.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.543
See, I did not get that.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.146
Where's Monica? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.185
I'm Monica.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.485
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.194
I've been thinking...

19:25.497 --> 19:29.194
...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.531
I guess there's
only one way to do this.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.576
What are you doing?

19:40.746 --> 19:41.974
Don't do it.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.746
Will you marry me?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.086
What a bad idea.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.323
I can't not look at it.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.223
Why are you doing this?

19:56.495 --> 19:57.928
I don't know.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.031
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.726
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

20:08.073 --> 20:12.407
Do you think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.545
The best reason is pregnancy.

20:18.283 --> 20:23.186
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actually wanting to get married.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.580
Will you be my wife?

20:29.194 --> 20:33.631
I want you to take a minute and think
about how ridiculous this sounds.

20:37.436 --> 20:40.064
I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here now.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.903
None of that came from me.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.704
I never said I wanted to have babies
and get married!

20:48.981 --> 20:52.144
I was really confused.
Then I talked to these guys.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.715
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

20:56.722 --> 20:58.246
She's right, you know?

20:59.891 --> 21:02.792
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

21:04.630 --> 21:07.463
You know when I said
that I want you...

21:07.733 --> 21:10.793
...to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

21:11.003 --> 21:12.231
You're not ready.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.667
I didn't think I was!

21:19.611 --> 21:20.600
Oh, my God.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.774
What would you have done
if I had said yes?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.950
I would've been happy because...

21:26.184 --> 21:29.915
...I would spend the rest of
my life with the woman I love.

21:31.156 --> 21:34.455
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

21:39.498 --> 21:40.931
Will you pass that knife?

21:41.233 --> 21:42.928
No, I will not.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.398
You don't have to be mean about it.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.706
You're right. I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

21:52.544 --> 21:57.004
I was going to ask you to marry me
because I didn't say hello to you.

21:58.250 --> 22:02.084
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?

22:03.255 --> 22:04.745
How long is this going to go on?

22:05.023 --> 22:07.014
I think the length of teasing...

22:07.225 --> 22:11.594
...is directly related to how insane
you were. So a long time.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.219
This is fun!

22:13.565 --> 22:15.897
Remember that
"we were on a break" thing?

22:16.134 --> 22:18.295
I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

22:23.942 --> 22:25.375
That's not funny.
