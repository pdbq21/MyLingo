WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.864
I'll get coffee.
Want anything, baby doll?

00:05.105 --> 00:06.436
I'm fine. Thanks.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.938
I can't pull off "baby doll," can l?

00:09.075 --> 00:12.567
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.406
I'll make some tea.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.906
How you doing, pumpkin?

00:19.586 --> 00:22.783
-So it's going well for you two?
-I know. Really well.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.680
I'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.354
What do you think?

00:27.594 --> 00:29.585
It's great!
When will you ask her?

00:29.796 --> 00:31.593
Tonight. But don't say anything.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.356
I swear. I promise.

00:33.566 --> 00:34.863
I'm so excited!

00:35.101 --> 00:37.365
But listen, do not
get her flowers, okay?

00:37.604 --> 00:41.131
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.743
-I'll see you after work, sweetie.
-Okay. Bye.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.443
So, what movie should we see?

00:50.784 --> 00:53.252
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him!

00:54.721 --> 00:55.710
What? Really?

00:55.922 --> 00:59.881
He made me promise not to tell,
but I couldn't hold it in any longer!

01:00.794 --> 01:01.920
I can't believe this.

01:02.128 --> 01:05.564
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.759
Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.604
Good for you, Phoebe.
Way to go.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.736
No, but it is fast, isn't it?

01:14.674 --> 01:18.110
-I like him, but I'm not ready.
-So, what are you gonna do?

01:18.311 --> 01:22.179
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him!

01:22.916 --> 01:23.940
Me? Why me?

01:24.150 --> 01:26.175
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.321
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.615
I'll try, but I'm not sure
what good it'd do.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.328
I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.656
That is so sweet.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.029
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.375
The One With the Ball

02:35.555 --> 02:39.184
Hey, Ross, is Staten lsland
really an island?

02:39.759 --> 02:42.557
That's why they call it
Staten "lsland."

02:42.996 --> 02:45.760
Oh, I thought it was
like Long lsland.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.704
Also an island.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.532
-What time is it?
-2:17.

02:57.610 --> 03:01.774
We haven't dropped
this ball for an hour.

03:01.915 --> 03:02.904
Are you serious?

03:03.049 --> 03:05.813
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't say anything.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.212
I didn't wanna jinx it.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.389
We are pretty good at this.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.056
We totally forgot about lunch.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.257
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.591
I think my pants are a little loose.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.231
Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?

03:28.841 --> 03:31.401
I bought something.
I'm not sure she'll like it.

03:31.611 --> 03:35.513
It may seem crazy, but I've wanted
this since I was a little girl.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.682
You bought Shaun Cassidy!

03:38.685 --> 03:39.913
No. I wish!

03:40.153 --> 03:41.484
Okay, you ready?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.482
Check it out.

03:52.465 --> 03:53.659
What is it?

03:53.866 --> 03:55.629
What the hell is that?

03:57.136 --> 03:58.330
It's a cat.

03:58.538 --> 03:59.869
That is not a cat!

04:01.307 --> 04:02.467
Yes, it is!

04:02.709 --> 04:04.973
Why is it inside out?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.210
Excuse me!

04:10.483 --> 04:14.715
But this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.479
How much did you pay for that?

04:17.690 --> 04:20.022
It was extravagant,
but I got a good deal.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.124
-How much?
-Thousand bucks.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.459
On a cat?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.164
It's not a cat!

04:30.036 --> 04:34.200
For a thousand dollars,
you'd think at least it'd come with hair.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.768
Or something.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.906
All right. Listen, ball boys.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.807
My grandma had one when I was little.
It was the sweetest thing.

04:43.016 --> 04:46.144
It would sit in my lap
and just purr all day long.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.219
I would drag a string
and it would chase it.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.423
Free cats do that too, you know.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.116
It's not a cat!

04:54.560 --> 04:58.189
I'm really excited about this, okay?
I don't care what you think.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.629
I'm gonna set up a litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.431
What am I gonna call her?
Fluffy?

05:09.475 --> 05:13.878
Do you wanna get something to eat,
or see how long we can throw this ball?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.877
The ball thing.

05:18.418 --> 05:23.481
Wouldn't it be great if we could go
for two hours without dropping it?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.655
Yeah, it would!

05:27.894 --> 05:29.418
Let's do it.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.234
I have to pee.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.596
And Rachel's in the bathroom!

05:43.443 --> 05:45.138
Man, I didn't think we'd make it.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.110
I know.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.305
Don't switch hands, okay?

05:58.591 --> 06:01.287
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.790
What are you doing here?

06:06.999 --> 06:09.024
I am here to report a crime.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.736
It's a crime that
we don't spend time together.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.860
What's up?

06:14.640 --> 06:18.701
You're thinking about moving in with
Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.206
You know, man to...

06:20.446 --> 06:21.777
...well, me.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.206
Sure, okay.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.614
Are you crazy?

06:27.286 --> 06:28.275
Are you insane?

06:28.521 --> 06:32.514
If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be living together.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.189
I considered that.
It'd make me happy.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.026
-You mean scared.
-No, I mean happy.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.291
Scared happy.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.160
What are you doing?

06:42.368 --> 06:43.995
I'm trying to open your eyes!

06:44.203 --> 06:47.001
If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.207
You get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.138
You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.246
I know. I can't wait!

06:56.315 --> 06:59.045
Were your parents happy or something?

07:00.019 --> 07:03.420
I was lucky enough to find
someone that I really love.

07:03.723 --> 07:06.749
I just want to be around her
as much as I can.

07:07.326 --> 07:10.022
When you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

07:10.229 --> 07:11.560
You know what I'm saying?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.493
Yeah, I think I do.

07:13.733 --> 07:14.859
You know what?

07:15.067 --> 07:19.401
Move in with her. Move in right now.
Maybe I'll move in with Monica.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.039
No, it's too soon for you guys.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.240
You're right about that.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.043
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

07:31.284 --> 07:33.878
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

07:34.120 --> 07:37.556
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.851
How did it get there?

07:42.895 --> 07:44.954
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.998
Hey, guys.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.931
I left my watch here last night.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.361
-lt was here. Where is it?
-I don't know.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.970
I'm late for work.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.199
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.943
Can you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and help me find it?

08:03.216 --> 08:05.582
Oh, I don't know....
Yeah, can't do it.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.318
-What?
-Do not drop that ball.

08:13.559 --> 08:14.787
We haven't dropped it in....

08:15.061 --> 08:16.995
Two hours, 27 minutes.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.830
Really?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.925
I won't make it in to work today.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.230
I don't feel very good.

08:28.975 --> 08:32.741
For a second, I thought I was
feeling better, but I'm not.

08:35.147 --> 08:36.444
Hey, Rach.

08:36.649 --> 08:40.415
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.918
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.790
You have scratches all over you.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.518
Well, it's my cat.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.792
-Oh, I got a cat.
-I don't want a cat!

08:54.033 --> 08:56.433
Don't worry, it's not a cat.

08:57.503 --> 09:01.200
You guys, this cat is nothing
like my grandmother's cat.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.340
It's not sweet.
It's not cute.

09:03.609 --> 09:08.706
I dragged a string, and it flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

09:10.182 --> 09:14.380
I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

09:14.520 --> 09:16.545
...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"

09:23.329 --> 09:26.662
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $1000 for a cat.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.164
You paid $1000 for a cat
when you owe me $300?

09:30.369 --> 09:33.202
Well, I was gonna let you
play with it.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.977
Did you talk to Gary
about moving in?

09:43.215 --> 09:44.876
I think you should do it.

09:46.419 --> 09:51.220
He's a great guy and he loves you
a lot. You are a very lucky lady.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.247
You are useless!

09:54.927 --> 09:57.896
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

09:58.164 --> 10:00.098
...and you can't even do that right!

10:00.333 --> 10:03.029
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.570
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.801
Hey, Chandler.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.276
Hey, Gar.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.348
Hey, sweetie.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.676
Can I talk to you for a second?

10:22.755 --> 10:23.881
You look pretty today.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.715
Thanks. Okay.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.282
Here's the thing.

10:28.527 --> 10:31.621
I really want this relationship
to move forward.

10:31.897 --> 10:35.060
If you're not moving forward,
you're moving backwards.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.270
No, if you're not moving forward,
you're staying still.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.370
And staying still is good.
Watch this.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.870
I want you to move in with me.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.115
That is so sweet.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.646
But don't you think
it's too soon?

10:52.918 --> 10:55.148
There's so much we don't know
about each other.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.822
Okay. I get it.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.991
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.499
I don't want
to mess up what we have.

11:12.738 --> 11:16.105
I'm worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.508
Which is why my answer is yes!

11:23.983 --> 11:25.416
Really?

11:25.651 --> 11:27.619
You're so happy.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.789
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!

11:39.765 --> 11:41.426
We're on the same team!

11:43.436 --> 11:46.166
You guys have been doing this
for four hours?

11:46.372 --> 11:47.805
That's right, baby.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.668
-All right. Let me in.
-No, no! Don't do it!

11:51.444 --> 11:52.877
What?

11:53.979 --> 11:55.640
He's a dropper.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.516
Oh, yeah. That's right!

11:59.852 --> 12:01.342
I'm not a dropper!

12:01.854 --> 12:05.017
It's really a three-person
game, you know?

12:06.158 --> 12:08.126
It's throwing and catching.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.427
All right.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.425
Oh, it's so hard.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.542
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.072
Oh, good God!

12:30.282 --> 12:33.547
I give up. I don't know what
I'm gonna do with this thing.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.145
Baking it didn't help?

12:39.158 --> 12:41.126
Take it back to where you got it.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.227
I tried. They won't take her back.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.898
Maybe that's because she's
a minion of the Antichrist.

12:49.468 --> 12:50.901
Why won't they take it?

12:51.137 --> 12:53.628
They said they would only
give me store credit.

12:53.906 --> 12:57.205
What am I gonna do?
Get 1000 regular cats?

12:57.643 --> 13:01.340
You said it was a show cat. Why don't you
show it, win some prize money.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.246
Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter,
and all you win are these ribbons...

13:05.384 --> 13:08.376
...which technically belong to the damn cat.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.955
You can keep it until you
find out what to do with it.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.557
That's not the point.
I'm out $1000...

13:13.826 --> 13:15.259
...I'm all scratched up...

13:15.461 --> 13:18.828
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand!

13:23.469 --> 13:24.458
Oh, my God!

13:24.603 --> 13:27.333
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!

13:27.573 --> 13:30.235
My vision's been compromised!

13:31.477 --> 13:33.411
Oh, God! Okay.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.675
It's okay. Man, that was close.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.644
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

13:43.055 --> 13:46.650
-We have great news.
-We're moving in together. Yay!

13:48.227 --> 13:49.592
Congratulations.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.285
-I'm so excited!
-So am l.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.228
You're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.333
See you at the station later.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.504
I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in!

14:02.007 --> 14:03.736
So you're moving in with him?

14:03.943 --> 14:07.902
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
Maybe it'll be all right.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.642
I do like him a lot...

14:09.849 --> 14:12.579
...and probably do it
eventually, anyway.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.821
Plus, think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.287
Do you write him a lot?

14:18.591 --> 14:20.525
I heard when people live together...

14:20.759 --> 14:23.193
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

14:26.098 --> 14:27.929
-Yeah, yeah.
-That's right.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.336
Sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.437
Hey, honey.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.677
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.046
No, nothing.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.546
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.050
-Nothing at all?
-No.

14:51.290 --> 14:55.351
If something opens up, we'll move in.
If it has a pool. I need a pool.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.288
Can I talk to you?

15:03.168 --> 15:04.692
Take a seat.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.628
You okay?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.535
You feel all right?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.676
I feel great, because
we're moving in together.

15:13.812 --> 15:14.972
So you....

15:15.214 --> 15:18.911
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

15:20.386 --> 15:21.648
You checked the Post?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.385
Yeah, there was nothing.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.692
-Can I get some water?
-ln a minute.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.827
You checked today's Post?

15:32.531 --> 15:34.089
Yeah, today's.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.499
Because this is today's Post.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.170
And these are the listings I found.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.167
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

15:44.376 --> 15:47.539
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights!

15:48.113 --> 15:52.573
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.453
Let me tell you what's going on here.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.718
Don't look at the table.
Look at me.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.289
Somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.359
Someone said yes,
but now she has doubts...

16:05.597 --> 16:09.055
...because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?

16:12.037 --> 16:14.562
Yes, fine! I am someone!

16:16.375 --> 16:18.775
You want me to say it?
I have doubts!

16:19.044 --> 16:20.807
I'm sorry!

16:24.049 --> 16:26.313
It's okay that you feel this way.

16:26.585 --> 16:30.453
It is soon, and there's things
we don't know about each other.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.157
Everything I know about you,
I really like.

16:33.392 --> 16:37.590
Things I don't know, I'll learn in
a place with our names on the mailbox.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.628
That's so sweet.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.900
But if it's too soon for you,
we don't have to do it.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.969
I want you to be happy.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.434
Living with you would make me happy.

16:50.642 --> 16:51.802
You don't have to say that.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.841
I want to live with you.
I want to move in with you.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.479
Are you sure?

16:57.416 --> 17:00.647
Definitely, yes! Let's live in
an apartment we both live in.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.750
Oh, that's great.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.580
Oh, wait, one sec.

17:04.723 --> 17:08.090
Hey, you! Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

17:09.294 --> 17:13.788
I always wanted to say that every time
I was in these rooms, which was never.

17:16.835 --> 17:17.824
Show cat!

17:18.170 --> 17:20.263
Quality show cat!

17:21.774 --> 17:23.833
-Show cat!
-Oh, my God!

17:24.043 --> 17:26.136
What's wrong with your baby?

17:26.812 --> 17:28.609
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.548
-It's creepy-looking.
-Oh, no.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.345
It's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.690
Yeah. Do you want it?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.292
No, I hate cats.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.291
Then what are you doing to me?

17:44.530 --> 17:47.556
Get out of here, all right?
Move on!

17:49.201 --> 17:50.691
What an unusual cat.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.497
Yes, thank you! Exactly.
You want it?

17:54.139 --> 17:55.163
Maybe.

17:55.374 --> 17:58.537
I was thinking about getting a cat
from the shelter, but....

17:59.078 --> 18:02.309
-Okay. Why not?
-Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.408
-What?
-Okay, 1000.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.846
Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?

18:08.053 --> 18:12.854
I do, but you'll have to look at this
as more of an investment than a cat.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.355
Okay, yeah.
I just wanted a cat.

18:18.897 --> 18:23.027
Obviously, you know how to haggle,
so I won't try and take you on.

18:23.268 --> 18:27.432
So $800, and I don't call the cops,
because you are robbing me blind!

18:27.639 --> 18:31.075
Blind! Just take the cat.
Leave the money. Run away!

18:31.276 --> 18:33.471
Run away. Damn it!

18:33.979 --> 18:37.244
Can't you at least smile or something?

18:39.918 --> 18:42.648
Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?

18:49.628 --> 18:52.722
-I'm starving.
-Come on, guys. Suck it up!

18:52.931 --> 18:54.728
We're closing in on 10 hours.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.924
It's gut-check time!

18:57.136 --> 19:01.300
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.503
I made this game what it is!

19:03.775 --> 19:05.572
Not fun anymore?

19:07.246 --> 19:08.508
I'm still hungry.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.242
There's pizza at my place. We can eat
with one hand. Are you with me?

19:12.551 --> 19:15.145
-I am.
-All right, let's go! Come on!

19:15.654 --> 19:17.246
Let's go, Team Monica!

19:20.392 --> 19:22.451
We can work out the name later.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.490
What is your cat doing in my bowl?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.325
I'm defrosting a chicken.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.663
I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.567
Thank God!

19:36.942 --> 19:39.342
-Get your money back?
-Yeah, $1500.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.636
You made a profit?

19:44.950 --> 19:47.612
I just came for the red velvet pillow.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.018
-There you go.
-Thanks, Rachel.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.259
Don't forget, you can come
visit her anytime.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.087
Oh, good. Great.
I'll keep that in mind.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.158
So is this some kind
of snake or something?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.306
I like waking up with you.

20:17.516 --> 20:20.110
I like waking up with you too.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.218
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.887
I could stay here all day.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.953
That would be great.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.855
-We could have breakfast in bed.
-Wait, just a second.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.456
Oh, no.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.165
All right. Come on, Monica!
Look alive. Come on!

20:51.550 --> 20:53.916
Oh, I was having the best dream.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.077
-What?
-I dreamed I was drowning...

20:56.221 --> 20:58.746
...and not throwing this ball.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.683
Oh, good. You're all up.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.360
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.260
Oh, yeah. That's over.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.468
Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.694
-He shot a bird.
-That is over.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.038
-I'm sorry.
-That's terrible.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.743
Are you okay?

21:18.877 --> 21:20.401
I'll be all right.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.171
Here, Phoebe.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.373
I don't feel like playing.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.417
It's okay. It's okay.

21:33.325 --> 21:36.385
It didn't happen.
No one needs to know.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.790
She's not an official ball player.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.727
Only official ball players
can drop the ball.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.227
-Come on.
-Let's go.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.329
You wanna get breakfast?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.402
Okay, let's race!

21:49.641 --> 21:51.632
First one there wins.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.946
You guys wanna eat here?

22:01.787 --> 22:02.879
That was great, huh?

22:03.055 --> 22:05.216
Can you believe how long we threw it?

22:05.424 --> 22:07.551
It is amazing it lasted that long.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.522
My arm is killing me.

22:09.728 --> 22:12.356
No, I meant with
the dropper over here.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.895
How did I get this
reputation as a dropper?

22:15.100 --> 22:17.330
I am anything but a dropper.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.026
Ross!
