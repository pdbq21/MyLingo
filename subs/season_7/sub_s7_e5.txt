WEBVTT

00:03.615 --> 00:07.779
-What's the matter?
-Somebody on the subway Iicked my neck!

00:07.986 --> 00:10.113
WiIIy's stiII aIive!

00:11.189 --> 00:13.123
-What are you guys doing?
-My mom caIIed.

00:13.325 --> 00:15.520
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

00:15.794 --> 00:20.026
-We're Iooking for a good picture of us.
-I'm afraid that does not e<i>x</i>ist.

00:20.966 --> 00:22.763
There are great pictures of us.

00:23.035 --> 00:27.199
No, there are great pictures of you standing
ne<i>x</i>t to a guy who's going Iike this:

00:28.707 --> 00:32.973
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

00:34.313 --> 00:37.407
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

00:37.649 --> 00:38.843
Here's a great one.

00:39.051 --> 00:43.283
-Yeah, I'm not in that.
-No, but Iook at me, aII tan.

00:43.589 --> 00:47.025
Why don't you go get portraits done
by a professionaI photographer?

00:47.292 --> 00:51.023
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

00:53.332 --> 00:57.200
Yeah, that's great. Ne<i>x</i>t to that,
ChandIer won't Iook so stupid.

00:58.604 --> 01:02.301
-ChandIer, what do you say?
-AII right, but I'm not going.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.338
''I'm'' going.

01:05.110 --> 01:07.237
The One With The Engagement Picture

01:40.879 --> 01:43.109
Dude, that reverse Iay-up.

01:43.315 --> 01:45.545
-And how about those three-pointers?
-Amazing.

01:45.751 --> 01:49.687
And those guys were this cIose
to Ietting us pIay this time too.

01:53.625 --> 01:57.288
Hey, Iook. Phoebe's taIking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

01:57.596 --> 02:02.295
You caII him, ''Cute Coffeehouse Guy''?
We caII him, ''Hums WhiIe He Pees.''

02:02.868 --> 02:06.031
Yes, and we caII Ross,
''Lingers in the Bathroom.''

02:07.139 --> 02:10.597
Hey, you guys, Hums WhiIe He Pees
just asked me out!

02:12.144 --> 02:15.272
-I thought that guy was married.
-He is, but he's getting divorced.

02:15.514 --> 02:17.175
Ross, maybe you know him.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.679
It's not a cIub.

02:22.521 --> 02:25.854
If he's getting a divorce,
is it such a good idea to date him?

02:26.358 --> 02:30.818
-Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
-They have that on the napkins at the cIub.

02:32.464 --> 02:36.059
-I gotta get back to work.
-You don't have to be back for a haIf-hour.

02:36.334 --> 02:39.826
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during Iunch.

02:41.373 --> 02:44.206
I couId just spread him on a cracker.

02:46.311 --> 02:48.575
You have a crush on him,
why wouId you hire him?

02:48.814 --> 02:51.715
-You know you can't date him, right?
-Oh, no, I know that.

02:51.983 --> 02:54.884
We made a joke that we spend
so much time together...

02:55.153 --> 02:56.814
...he shouId caII me, his ''work-wife.''

03:01.860 --> 03:05.853
Soon he'II be abIe to caII you, ''that
Iady he knew that got fired.''

03:06.598 --> 03:09.726
I'm not gonna get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

03:09.968 --> 03:12.198
You wouIdn't mind
if he was dating someone eIse?

03:12.404 --> 03:17.034
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that sIut in marketing.

03:18.243 --> 03:20.768
Maybe I shouId open
a divorced men's cIub.

03:21.413 --> 03:23.472
Dude, that's so sad.

03:23.782 --> 03:26.751
I couId put a basketbaII court
in the back.

03:27.385 --> 03:28.682
CouId I pIay?

03:34.726 --> 03:37.354
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

03:37.863 --> 03:41.196
-I just did them.
-WeII, drop and give me 1 0 more.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.765
What?

03:44.002 --> 03:45.936
I had a drink with Iunch.

03:47.439 --> 03:50.806
-Did those cost reports come in?
-I fiIIed them out Iast night.

03:51.076 --> 03:52.873
CouId you make me four copies?

03:53.078 --> 03:54.909
-Sure.
-Great, thank you.

04:15.634 --> 04:18.569
-Hey, RacheI.
-Hi, MeIissa. What's up?

04:18.770 --> 04:22.797
I'm just about to go out to the store.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.669
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

04:25.911 --> 04:28.675
Dried fruit, and granoIa
and stuff Iike that.

04:28.947 --> 04:30.812
-What's up?
-Is Tag here?

04:31.049 --> 04:32.073
No. Why?

04:32.350 --> 04:34.784
I was gonna taIk to him
about tonight.

04:34.986 --> 04:39.286
ReaIIy? You got a IittIe crush
on Tag there, do you?

04:40.158 --> 04:42.319
We've been fIirting back and forth...

04:42.561 --> 04:46.588
...but I was hoping tonight it wouId
turn into something a IittIe more than that.

04:46.798 --> 04:49.824
Easy there, MeIissa.
This ain't a Iocker room, okay.

04:52.704 --> 04:57.835
But, you know, I remember him saying
that he had pIans tonight.

04:58.343 --> 05:00.607
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

05:01.513 --> 05:03.504
AII right, back to work.

05:04.115 --> 05:06.515
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

05:07.719 --> 05:12.850
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'II caII your supervisor.

05:19.598 --> 05:23.125
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

05:23.835 --> 05:26.235
Now, ChandIer, you want to
give us a smiIe?

05:26.471 --> 05:27.699
Okay.

05:31.409 --> 05:34.845
-I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortabIe?
-No, I am.

05:35.347 --> 05:38.612
ChandIer, I know you can do this.
You have a beautifuI smiIe.

05:38.884 --> 05:41.045
-I do?
-Yeah.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.918
Maybe you don't have to smiIe.
Let's try something eIse.

05:47.092 --> 05:49.424
-Try Iooking se<i>x</i>y.
-Okay.

05:56.201 --> 05:57.725
Or not.

06:02.707 --> 06:05.073
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

06:05.277 --> 06:09.043
I got an audition down the street,
and I spiIIed sauce on my shirt.

06:10.482 --> 06:13.417
-You got an e<i>x</i>tra one?
-Yeah, sure.

06:16.221 --> 06:17.381
Here.

06:17.622 --> 06:18.987
Great.

06:19.891 --> 06:22.382
You got anything that's
not RaIph Lauren?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.991
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

06:28.199 --> 06:29.632
I guess this'II be fine.

06:29.901 --> 06:33.200
-What are you doing tonight?
-Nothing. Why?

06:33.438 --> 06:36.601
How wouId you feeI about
taking out my assistant, Tag? I'II pay.

06:37.709 --> 06:41.975
It's gonna take a Iot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

06:43.481 --> 06:46.416
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

06:46.651 --> 06:49.586
ReaIIy? Because I couId kind of
use the money.

06:50.522 --> 06:54.322
He's new in town, and I know
he doesn't have any guy friends.

06:54.592 --> 06:57.584
Take him to a baII game or something.
I'd reaIIy appreciate it.

06:58.096 --> 06:59.961
-Yeah, okay, no probIem.
-Thank you.

07:00.231 --> 07:02.631
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

07:15.714 --> 07:17.614
You got a red shirt?

07:20.652 --> 07:23.416
I know. Let's try a Iook...

07:23.688 --> 07:26.020
...of far-off wonderment.

07:26.324 --> 07:31.785
Gaze into our future, and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

07:37.535 --> 07:40.698
ChandIer, what is the matter
with your face?

07:40.905 --> 07:43.874
This picture shouId say,
''GeIIer and Bing to be married,'' ...

07:44.075 --> 07:47.169
...not, ''LocaI woman saves
drowning moron.''

07:48.847 --> 07:52.578
Hey, don't Iaugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

07:53.818 --> 07:55.911
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

08:01.760 --> 08:02.852
I Iike this one.

08:03.061 --> 08:06.895
It seems to say, ''I Iove you and
that's why I have to kiII you.''

08:09.367 --> 08:10.857
Can't aII be bad.

08:11.436 --> 08:14.269
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

08:14.706 --> 08:15.695
There it is.

08:15.974 --> 08:19.341
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

08:20.045 --> 08:22.309
Why did you ever sIeep with me?

08:23.448 --> 08:26.042
Do you reaIIy want to puII
at that thread?

08:30.688 --> 08:32.713
-I'm reaIIy having a good time.
-Me too.

08:33.024 --> 08:35.822
Sorry that guy on the subway
Iicked your neck.

08:37.228 --> 08:39.560
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

08:40.165 --> 08:41.928
I don't mean to be presumptuous...

08:42.133 --> 08:45.159
...but I have tickets to the
baIIroom-dancing finaIs tomorrow.

08:45.703 --> 08:47.068
Yeah, I--

08:47.338 --> 08:51.536
WeII, I missed the semifinaIs,
so I think I wouId just be Iost.

08:52.577 --> 08:55.705
I know that it's reaIIy Iame, but I got
these tickets from my boss--

08:55.980 --> 08:58.574
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

08:58.817 --> 09:00.944
Okay, don't freak out. I'II go.

09:01.586 --> 09:03.178
It's my e<i>x</i>-wife, Whitney.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.356
I cannot deaI with her now.
That woman is crazy.

09:06.558 --> 09:08.150
Okay, I know. HoId on.

09:09.227 --> 09:10.819
-Hey, Ross.
-Yeah.

09:11.329 --> 09:14.389
That's Whitney, KyIe's e<i>x</i>-wife,
out there.

09:14.599 --> 09:18.262
Do you think you couId divert her
so we couId sIip out?

09:18.536 --> 09:20.527
What? No.

09:21.606 --> 09:25.667
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the baIIroom-dance finaIs.

09:25.977 --> 09:28.775
I don't think so, Pheebs.

09:31.182 --> 09:32.581
AII right, I'II do it.

09:34.219 --> 09:37.552
-But just because you're a friend.
-Okay.

09:51.603 --> 09:53.434
Hi, Ginger.

09:53.638 --> 09:55.265
I want my key back.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.998
-I don't have it.
-It's right there.

09:59.043 --> 10:00.510
Okay, SherIock.

10:01.412 --> 10:03.437
I'm sorry,
but you'd better go, Pheebs.

10:03.715 --> 10:06.809
I just wanted to thank you, though,
for diverting KyIe's e<i>x</i>.

10:07.051 --> 10:09.952
You're weIcome.
We'II taIk about it Iater.

10:11.723 --> 10:14.658
-Hi, Whitney.
-Hi, Ross.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.387
-Are you ready for breakfast?
-Yep.

10:19.731 --> 10:23.827
KyIe's e<i>x</i>-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

10:24.936 --> 10:28.303
Can you give me a second
whiIe I taIk to this woman...

10:28.540 --> 10:30.906
...who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

10:31.976 --> 10:34.342
-Sure.
-Okay.

10:36.447 --> 10:40.110
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

10:40.318 --> 10:41.910
Watching baIIroom dancing?

10:42.120 --> 10:45.180
Yes, that's where we reaIized
we were both super-cooI peopIe.

10:46.591 --> 10:50.493
Look, KyIe just toId me
some reaIIy bad stuff about her.

10:50.795 --> 10:53.355
-Like what?
-Like she's reaIIy mean...

10:53.531 --> 10:55.692
...and she's overIy criticaI and--

10:55.967 --> 11:00.961
She wiII paint a room a reaIIy bright
coIor without even checking with you.

11:02.707 --> 11:03.969
Okay.

11:04.475 --> 11:07.467
And she uses se<i>x</i> as a weapon.

11:07.712 --> 11:09.111
Thank you for warning me.

11:09.314 --> 11:14.217
At breakfast, I'II be on aIert for
room painting and se<i>x</i> weapons.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.112
-You're stiII gonna go out with her?
-Yeah.

11:18.356 --> 11:20.790
WeII, didn't you hear
what I just said?

11:21.092 --> 11:24.027
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

11:24.295 --> 11:28.197
Of course her e<i>x</i>-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now, if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me.

11:28.399 --> 11:30.697
Listen to me, she is crazy!

11:31.836 --> 11:34.737
Your door isn't soundproof.

11:36.741 --> 11:39.801
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

11:48.152 --> 11:50.814
-E<i>x</i>cuse me.
-He's not here!

11:51.322 --> 11:54.348
My God, do you peopIe have
nothing better to do...

11:54.525 --> 11:58.120
...than to traipse into my office
and just gawk at my assistant.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.230
I'm EmiIy from upstairs.

12:01.399 --> 12:04.891
Susan's stiII in the hospitaI, and I'm
coIIecting money to send her fIowers.

12:06.104 --> 12:09.005
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay. Yes, of course.

12:09.173 --> 12:13.269
Just take it aII. Take it aII.
And pIease, pIease, give my best to EmiIy.

12:13.444 --> 12:15.036
I'm EmiIy.

12:16.014 --> 12:17.948
Yeah. No, I meant...

12:18.783 --> 12:21.115
...the other one that you said.

12:25.356 --> 12:27.187
-Morning.
-Hi, Tag.

12:27.425 --> 12:31.953
-Did you have fun with Joey Iast night?
-Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.861
That's nice.

12:34.198 --> 12:37.793
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with aII these women.

12:40.838 --> 12:44.069
Women? You mean, Iike oId women?

12:44.876 --> 12:47.003
Kind of oId, Iike 30.

12:53.685 --> 12:56.711
I never used to be abIe
to just taIk to girIs in bars...

12:56.988 --> 13:00.185
...but I got Iike 20 phone numbers
Iast night.

13:01.192 --> 13:04.650
That's great.

13:04.862 --> 13:07.353
Joey must have reaIIy taught
you some stuff.

13:07.665 --> 13:08.689
A IittIe.

13:10.368 --> 13:11.960
How you doing?

13:18.676 --> 13:23.306
See? That's a great smiIe.
Easy, naturaI.

13:23.581 --> 13:25.378
Now pretend I have a camera.

13:27.318 --> 13:29.878
-You're changing it.
-I can't heIp it.

13:30.121 --> 13:33.522
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

13:33.791 --> 13:35.691
Borrow money from me?

13:36.928 --> 13:41.592
Yeah. Okay, first of aII,
you want to make it Iook spontaneous.

13:41.833 --> 13:46.327
So here's what I do. I Iook down,
Iook down, keep Iooking down.

13:46.537 --> 13:48.004
Then I Iook up.

13:50.808 --> 13:52.298
See? Now you try.

13:52.510 --> 13:55.775
Look down. You're Iooking down.
Keep Iooking down.

13:56.013 --> 13:58.038
Why is there jeIIy on your shoe?

13:58.950 --> 14:00.349
I had a doughnut.

14:04.155 --> 14:07.318
So I heard you had some fun
with Tag Iast night.

14:07.525 --> 14:08.787
Yeah, that guy's aII right.

14:09.026 --> 14:13.122
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be aII ''Joey.''

14:14.132 --> 14:16.191
-What?
-You know, aII the women.

14:16.434 --> 14:19.301
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

14:19.537 --> 14:22.005
That's why I never had
any Iuck with ChandIer.

14:27.512 --> 14:29.707
I'm right here.

14:31.382 --> 14:34.317
WouId you mind just not
going out with him again?

14:34.519 --> 14:37.852
Just the idea of you, and he,
and aII these women--

14:38.055 --> 14:40.489
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him!

14:40.725 --> 14:42.454
But it just bothers me, aII right?

14:42.660 --> 14:45.356
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

14:45.563 --> 14:49.329
I got a great partner to pick
up girIs with. FinaIIy!

14:53.571 --> 14:55.766
I'm stiII right here.

14:56.607 --> 14:58.097
WiII you at Ieast taIk to him...

14:58.376 --> 15:02.904
...and teII him how hoIIow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

15:03.915 --> 15:05.177
What?

15:06.584 --> 15:10.020
I just don't want him to meet anybody
untiI I'm over my crush.

15:10.254 --> 15:11.482
And I wiII get over it.

15:11.722 --> 15:14.589
It's not Iike I Iove him.
It's just physicaI.

15:14.859 --> 15:18.693
I get crushes Iike this aII the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.793
I know. Monica toId me.

15:22.567 --> 15:24.762
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

15:27.738 --> 15:29.000
Yeah, sure.

15:33.010 --> 15:35.410
Can you peopIe not see me?

15:38.649 --> 15:40.048
WiII you taIk to him?

15:40.251 --> 15:44.085
-I don't know, Rach.
-I'II give you 1 0 free RaIph Lauren shirts.

15:44.388 --> 15:45.650
One.

15:45.923 --> 15:48.517
No, 1 0. You said 1 0.
You can't take that back.

15:56.634 --> 15:58.124
You wanted to taIk to me?

15:58.436 --> 16:00.631
I don't know.
You got something for me?

16:00.905 --> 16:02.463
Yeah, this is from RacheI.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.574
Ten. Okay.

16:08.813 --> 16:11.077
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

16:11.749 --> 16:13.979
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, for you.

16:23.094 --> 16:26.860
Hey, how much wouId it cost
to get a big fan in here?

16:27.932 --> 16:30.162
-Hey, there you are.
-There I am.

16:30.468 --> 16:33.926
-You okay?
-Yeah, Joey said I needed to reIa<i>x</i>.

16:34.171 --> 16:35.934
So he gave me an antihistamine.

16:36.641 --> 16:37.665
What?

16:37.975 --> 16:40.500
I feII asIeep on the subway
and went to BrookIyn.

16:40.745 --> 16:43.236
BrookIyn is far.

16:44.382 --> 16:45.644
What were you thinking?

16:45.850 --> 16:49.513
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

16:50.488 --> 16:53.651
Okay, see. Look down.

16:53.891 --> 16:55.688
Look down.

16:56.193 --> 16:57.990
Look down.

17:03.701 --> 17:05.498
-ChandIer?
-Yeah?

17:11.242 --> 17:13.676
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:13.844 --> 17:17.871
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

17:18.883 --> 17:22.182
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

17:22.420 --> 17:26.049
FYI, she must have shown KyIe
over 30 paint sampIes...

17:26.290 --> 17:27.882
...before she painted that room.

17:29.360 --> 17:34.161
And his response to each one was,
''I don't give a tiny rat's ass.''

17:34.565 --> 17:37.659
Maybe she shouId have spent
a IittIe Iess time decorating...

17:37.902 --> 17:40.200
...and a IittIe more time
in the bedroom.

17:40.738 --> 17:43.229
I don't think we are going
to have that probIem...

17:43.474 --> 17:47.410
...but maybe that's just because I am not
emotionaIIy unavaiIabIe.

17:48.312 --> 17:50.109
You think he's
emotionaIIy unavaiIabIe?

17:50.314 --> 17:52.407
I think he can be.

17:53.317 --> 17:54.545
Maybe he wouIdn't be...

17:54.785 --> 17:57.185
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

17:57.388 --> 18:00.721
E<i>x</i>cuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her Iife.

18:00.925 --> 18:05.123
WeII, she certainIy knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve, 1 997.

18:05.930 --> 18:09.297
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

18:09.600 --> 18:13.400
That was three years ago.
She apoIogized and apoIogized.

18:13.604 --> 18:15.970
What more do you want?

18:16.273 --> 18:18.741
We want the Iast si<i>x</i> years back!

18:18.943 --> 18:21.810
So do we! So do we!

18:26.584 --> 18:28.711
I'm sorry you had to see that.

18:32.490 --> 18:34.355
-Morning, RacheI.
-Hi.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.786
Hey, so, what'd you do Iast night?

18:37.128 --> 18:38.789
-Went out with Joey.
-Yeah?

18:39.030 --> 18:42.659
Another night of bird-dogging
the <i>chicas</i>?

18:43.334 --> 18:45.962
No, we had a reaIIy good taIk.

18:47.505 --> 18:49.939
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

18:50.141 --> 18:53.110
Wow, I did not see that coming.

18:53.778 --> 18:55.609
It's just not reaIIy who I am.

18:55.813 --> 18:59.874
I've aIways been happier when--
Why am I teIIing you this?

19:00.117 --> 19:02.608
-You don't care about this stuff.
-Yes, I do.

19:04.321 --> 19:07.188
You were saying,
''I'm happier when I....''

19:07.391 --> 19:08.949
When I'm in a reIationship.

19:09.193 --> 19:11.457
-I Iove having a girIfriend.
-ReaIIy?

19:12.196 --> 19:13.857
Someone I can spoiI, you know.

19:14.131 --> 19:16.031
SpoiI?

19:18.369 --> 19:20.701
Let me ask you something.

19:20.905 --> 19:23.840
Do you beIieve there's one perfect
person for everyone?

19:24.575 --> 19:26.475
I'm starting to.

19:27.545 --> 19:30.480
If that person's in your Iife,
shouId you do something about it?

19:30.681 --> 19:32.308
Yes. HeII, yes.

19:32.917 --> 19:34.817
AII right, then, it's settIed.

19:35.019 --> 19:38.284
-I'm getting back together with my e<i>x</i>.
-I wouId Iove to!

19:38.989 --> 19:40.013
What?

19:44.395 --> 19:45.862
HeIIo?

19:47.698 --> 19:50.030
This is gonna be a whiIe. E<i>x</i>cuse me.

19:51.736 --> 19:52.862
Yeah.

19:53.370 --> 19:54.837
Yeah.

20:06.383 --> 20:07.372
My God!

20:09.587 --> 20:11.555
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

20:11.822 --> 20:14.723
And speaking of being seIfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

20:16.460 --> 20:19.361
Maybe she wouIdn't have to be
seIfish in bed...

20:19.563 --> 20:22.361
...if someone eIse knew where
everything was.

20:22.933 --> 20:25.333
Oh, he knows.

20:25.569 --> 20:27.127
For the most part.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.900
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

20:32.343 --> 20:34.038
We kind of need to taIk.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.475
-Both of you, together?
-What's up?

20:36.747 --> 20:40.911
WeII, I went over to KyIe's Iast night
to pick up a few things...

20:41.118 --> 20:43.882
...and we got to reminiscing.

20:44.088 --> 20:45.715
We taIked most of the night...

20:45.923 --> 20:48.357
...and reaIized the reason
we're angry with each other...

20:48.559 --> 20:52.586
...is because there are stiII
feeIings there.

20:53.998 --> 20:55.295
So....

20:57.902 --> 20:59.563
Oh, just say it, KyIe!

21:02.773 --> 21:04.104
We're gonna try again.

21:04.775 --> 21:08.404
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

21:08.612 --> 21:09.772
I'm gonna work on that.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.278
Right, because you're so
capabIe of change.

21:13.818 --> 21:15.945
You know, he hums when he pees.

21:17.922 --> 21:22.188
-I do know.
-Makes him miss the bowI, but whatever.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.194
We're so sorry.

21:25.896 --> 21:29.832
That's aII right. We don't need you.
I'm over it aIready.

21:30.034 --> 21:33.265
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

21:34.905 --> 21:36.600
Yeah, we're gonna go.

21:40.778 --> 21:42.439
I'm sorry.

21:43.781 --> 21:47.012
Pheebs, you were right about her.

21:48.552 --> 21:50.986
You know, she did try to use
se<i>x</i> as a weapon.

21:51.188 --> 21:53.315
Yeah, I hurt my back a IittIe.

21:55.726 --> 21:58.820
You know, he hums whiIe he does
other stuff too.

22:00.965 --> 22:03.934
We're better off without them.

22:04.702 --> 22:08.968
Even if they break up again, you better
not Iet him in your sad men's cIub.

22:09.173 --> 22:12.472
-Divorced men's cIub.
-Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

22:18.716 --> 22:21.014
You know, Pheebs, we don't taIk
that much anymore.

22:21.185 --> 22:22.516
Yeah.

22:24.555 --> 22:25.647
Hey, guys, check it out.

22:25.923 --> 22:29.381
-My mom sent me the paper.
-Let's see it.

22:31.028 --> 22:35.431
-Oh, yeah, that Iooks good.
-You make a very attractive coupIe.

22:38.435 --> 22:41.996
-Yeah, we Iook great together.
-We reaIIy do.

22:42.506 --> 22:43.973
Okay.

22:44.575 --> 22:46.702
Imagine what our kids wouId Iook Iike.

22:47.077 --> 22:48.510
We don't have to imagine.

22:50.848 --> 22:52.213
I'm marrying her.

22:52.516 --> 22:54.143
We'II just see.

23:00.024 --> 23:01.013
