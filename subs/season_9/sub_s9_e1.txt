WEBVTT

00:07.347 --> 00:09.317
Joey?

00:10.821 --> 00:12.916
Oh, my God.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.593
Okay.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.715
So..

00:29.224 --> 00:32.595
I guess we should
make it official, huh?

00:34.903 --> 00:36.371
Look, Rach, I..

00:36.840 --> 00:41.008
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross!

00:41.215 --> 00:44.085
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey, Joey.

00:45.223 --> 00:47.216
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

00:47.427 --> 00:52.894
And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.
I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.

00:54.876 --> 00:55.969
You're weird today.

00:58.282 --> 01:01.744
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

01:01.923 --> 01:05.658
Yeah. Actually, I kind of need
to talk to you too.

01:05.865 --> 01:08.666
- Joey, could you give us a minute?
- No.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.643
- What?
- I'm sorry. I meant, "No."

01:15.483 --> 01:16.952
Hi. Hey, look who's here.

01:17.889 --> 01:21.123
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.

01:21.328 --> 01:24.129
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.

01:25.103 --> 01:27.700
- Hey, where's Mom?
- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

01:27.942 --> 01:30.607
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each!

01:32.384 --> 01:37.555
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:

01:38.362 --> 01:40.127
Okay, wow.

01:41.636 --> 01:44.232
Emma's in the nursery.
I'll take you now if you want.

01:44.408 --> 01:47.939
- But I really want to talk to you.
- I know. I still need to talk to you.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.518
But before you guys do that,
I need to talk to you.

01:50.754 --> 01:53.624
And Ross, I need to talk to you.

01:53.827 --> 01:56.161
- And I need to talk to you.
- About what?

01:56.398 --> 02:00.031
To see if you know
what these guys are talking about.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.063
Isn't she beautiful?

02:49.505 --> 02:52.875
Look at her, my first grandchild.

02:55.016 --> 02:57.852
What about Ben?

02:58.489 --> 03:02.624
Well, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.

03:08.376 --> 03:11.781
God, isn't she beautiful?
Doesn't she look just like Rachel?

03:11.950 --> 03:16.084
I know everybody keeps saying that,
but all I see is Vin Diesel.

03:19.331 --> 03:21.233
What do you think
our baby will look like?

03:21.402 --> 03:23.703
Oh, God. Please. You.

03:24.709 --> 03:27.111
But it'll have my sense of humor.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.099
Have you thought any more
about you and Rachel?

03:37.267 --> 03:40.604
Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.

03:40.808 --> 03:45.112
That's so exciting! Wow.
You could've done that with us there.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.283
- Yeah, right.
- Sure. Okay.

03:48.456 --> 03:51.793
You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.

03:51.963 --> 03:55.458
What? When have I ever
touched myself in front of you guys?

03:55.637 --> 04:01.205
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.

04:01.415 --> 04:04.478
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.

04:06.693 --> 04:11.464
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.299
- Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.711
Dude, I just did something terrible.

04:19.251 --> 04:21.586
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

04:22.357 --> 04:26.594
No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

04:26.833 --> 04:31.467
- What? Why does she think that?
- Because it kind of looked like I did.

04:32.277 --> 04:33.678
Again, what?

04:34.247 --> 04:37.083
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand..

04:37.287 --> 04:39.781
As we all are at some point
during the day.

04:41.295 --> 04:43.596
It wasn't my ring.
It fell out of Ross' jacket..

04:43.767 --> 04:46.898
and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.

04:47.106 --> 04:49.201
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

04:49.411 --> 04:52.543
- I guess.
- And you did it first?

04:52.718 --> 04:55.918
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.

04:56.726 --> 04:58.753
I know. I know. It's awful.

04:58.964 --> 05:01.332
Well, what did she say?

05:01.536 --> 05:03.232
She said, "Yes."

05:04.976 --> 05:06.969
You're smiling.

05:07.146 --> 05:08.911
No, I'm not.

05:09.719 --> 05:12.657
Yes, you are. I can tell
by the way your mouth is.

05:14.127 --> 05:16.154
Does Ross know?

05:16.331 --> 05:19.303
Oh, my God.
What the hell am I gonna tell him?

05:19.505 --> 05:21.998
- Maybe you don't have to tell him.
- I like that. Yeah.

05:23.112 --> 05:25.811
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.

05:25.984 --> 05:28.888
But you have to do it before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

05:29.124 --> 05:32.290
All right, let's not get carried away.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.225
I want a baby.

05:35.403 --> 05:39.572
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

05:40.479 --> 05:45.217
If we have sex again, it'll double
our chances of getting pregnant.

05:45.389 --> 05:49.329
- I think that closet's still available.
- I am so tired.

05:53.673 --> 05:56.873
- Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.
- Deal!

06:00.520 --> 06:03.082
Dad, seriously!

06:04.394 --> 06:08.459
You know, you really should
see someone about that.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.538
Noted.

06:11.542 --> 06:15.573
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

06:15.751 --> 06:20.124
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.

06:22.463 --> 06:24.559
Actually..

06:28.810 --> 06:30.438
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:30.614 --> 06:32.948
Are you all right?

06:35.089 --> 06:39.393
- I think I just got engaged.
- Oh, my God! He did it?

06:39.598 --> 06:41.693
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

06:41.903 --> 06:46.276
Are you kidding?
I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

06:46.444 --> 06:50.214
I like to think of myself
as the puppet master of the group.

06:51.556 --> 06:55.290
- And you really think this is a good idea?
- I just talked him into it.

06:55.462 --> 06:58.195
Don't tell me I have to do you too?

06:58.368 --> 07:02.035
- The puppet master gets tired, people.
- Okay.

07:02.243 --> 07:04.942
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

07:05.149 --> 07:08.748
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.

07:08.957 --> 07:11.393
Really? Even Ross?

07:12.564 --> 07:15.536
Especially Ross.

07:17.975 --> 07:22.075
Hey, Phoebe. You know what?
I'll come back later.

07:24.287 --> 07:26.986
Wow. Kind of a full house here.

07:28.529 --> 07:32.024
I guess I'll just.. I'll come back.

07:34.307 --> 07:37.542
There he goes. Your fiance.

07:38.816 --> 07:41.013
I guess so.

07:41.522 --> 07:43.719
Although he does
play with himself in his sleep.

07:43.927 --> 07:46.956
I can't say I'm surprised.

07:50.039 --> 07:53.945
- Dad, what are you doing?
- There are people in there having sex.

07:57.153 --> 08:00.489
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

08:01.328 --> 08:02.763
- Wanna peek?
- No!

08:02.931 --> 08:03.990
Come on.

08:05.102 --> 08:08.040
You know what?
I don't like you without Mom.

08:08.241 --> 08:10.268
Come on.

08:10.947 --> 08:13.817
We're not peeking?

08:15.389 --> 08:17.724
Well, I'm peeking.

08:18.596 --> 08:21.431
Oh, my God!

08:21.769 --> 08:25.834
Hello, sir. You know Monica.

08:41.141 --> 08:43.840
- Hey, is it okay to come in?
- Of course.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.986
Joey, this ring, I..
It's beautiful. I love it.

08:49.290 --> 08:53.732
Yeah. Look, Rach,
there's something I gotta tell you.

08:53.900 --> 08:54.993
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:55.169 --> 08:59.405
- Are you ready to try nursing again?
- Yeah. Hi, Emma.

08:59.611 --> 09:01.581
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.151
It's all right.
It takes babies a while to get it.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.985
- But don't worry, it'll happen.
- Okay.

09:10.733 --> 09:14.639
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.942
Dear Lord.

09:19.417 --> 09:23.289
- I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
- Yeah, look, I think that..

09:23.458 --> 09:26.396
Because, look! She's pulling away again.

09:26.599 --> 09:30.265
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?

09:33.546 --> 09:35.675
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?

09:35.884 --> 09:39.118
You know, I don't really know her.

09:39.423 --> 09:42.259
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow?

09:42.463 --> 09:45.903
- Okay.
- Are you kidding me?

09:46.972 --> 09:49.808
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?

09:50.012 --> 09:53.416
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

09:55.289 --> 09:57.954
- Hey, wait up.
- Hi.

09:58.128 --> 09:59.859
Congratulations.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.266
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew.

10:03.471 --> 10:06.967
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit.

10:07.146 --> 10:10.608
Although he did eat a piece
of plastic fruit earlier.

10:10.787 --> 10:13.451
No, no, that you
and Rachel are engaged.

10:14.393 --> 10:17.331
- What?
- Oh, it's a secret?

10:17.499 --> 10:21.770
Goody. Yes! We haven't done
the secret thing in a long time.

10:22.877 --> 10:25.713
No, Rachel and I are not engaged.

10:25.883 --> 10:28.376
I think you are.

10:29.390 --> 10:31.360
What are you talking about?
Who told you that?

10:31.528 --> 10:34.124
Rachel, your betrothed.

10:35.503 --> 10:39.534
- We're not engaged.
- Oh, that's right. It's a secret.

10:39.711 --> 10:43.742
Right, you are not engaged.
I misunderstood her.

10:45.389 --> 10:49.090
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.

10:49.263 --> 10:50.356
Are you lying?

10:50.566 --> 10:54.973
Is this like that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?

10:58.683 --> 11:01.085
I am a doctor!

11:02.824 --> 11:05.819
You know what? I'm just gonna go
and talk to Rachel myself.

11:05.997 --> 11:08.594
All right. Well, me too.

11:10.940 --> 11:13.810
- Well, should we wake her up?
- No. No. Come on, let her sleep.

11:13.979 --> 11:18.420
- She's so exhausted.
- And so engaged.

11:29.343 --> 11:33.078
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!

11:34.086 --> 11:37.058
Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?

11:37.226 --> 11:40.323
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

11:40.499 --> 11:43.198
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

11:44.775 --> 11:46.904
- I didn't give her that ring.
- You didn't?

11:47.079 --> 11:49.379
- No!
- So whose ring is it?

11:49.885 --> 11:51.855
It's mine.

11:52.891 --> 11:54.861
- Is it an engagement ring?
- Yes.

11:55.061 --> 11:56.860
- But you didn't give it to her?
- No.

11:57.065 --> 11:59.092
- But you were going to propose?
- No!

11:59.905 --> 12:03.071
I might be losing interest in this.

12:03.579 --> 12:06.949
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring..

12:07.119 --> 12:09.146
because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.

12:09.323 --> 12:11.556
But all I wanted to do was see..

12:11.728 --> 12:15.566
if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.330
What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

12:19.376 --> 12:22.781
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed like she didn't want to either.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.946
But I don't understand
how any of this happened.

12:26.123 --> 12:30.063
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose..

12:30.232 --> 12:33.637
throw it on
and just start telling people?

12:33.839 --> 12:36.743
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.

12:36.979 --> 12:42.115
Well, I didn't! I didn't propose!

12:42.657 --> 12:44.489
Unless..

12:46.330 --> 12:48.163
Did I?

12:52.577 --> 12:56.950
I haven't slept in 40 hours and..

12:58.689 --> 13:03.357
It does sound
like something I would do.

13:09.978 --> 13:12.380
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.889
It's just, I still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.

13:16.090 --> 13:20.326
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees!

13:20.766 --> 13:24.672
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

13:24.841 --> 13:28.542
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.

13:34.794 --> 13:36.923
Hi, Dad.

13:37.432 --> 13:42.705
- I can still call you that, right?
- Of course. I'll always be your dad.

13:42.877 --> 13:47.876
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

13:50.025 --> 13:53.225
- It wasn't fun?
- Why, why, why would you..?

13:53.766 --> 13:56.328
Look, I just don't want you to think..

13:56.505 --> 13:59.169
that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.

13:59.376 --> 14:01.039
Well, I don't think that.

14:01.213 --> 14:05.051
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at all.

14:05.221 --> 14:07.852
It was a simpler time.

14:08.762 --> 14:11.494
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.729
To kill you.

14:13.906 --> 14:16.639
Why, why, why would you..?

14:18.682 --> 14:20.652
We're trying to have a baby.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.120
- What?
- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.485
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

14:25.696 --> 14:28.098
Well, get back in there!
I'll guard the door!

14:28.267 --> 14:31.171
That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.469
Whoa! I don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?

14:34.012 --> 14:35.914
Daddy!

14:36.117 --> 14:37.677
You gotta get at it, princess.

14:37.854 --> 14:39.983
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you..

14:40.158 --> 14:42.755
whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it!

14:42.930 --> 14:44.455
That's how I got my bad hip.

14:45.536 --> 14:49.670
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the bullet hole in my head.

14:49.878 --> 14:53.476
This one time I had my knee
on the sink, and your mother was..

14:53.652 --> 14:56.282
Seriously, sir, my brains,
all over the wall.

14:58.161 --> 15:01.760
I don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.532
You're right.
This is about your positions.

15:04.741 --> 15:08.339
Now, what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position..

15:08.515 --> 15:10.644
for conceiving a child.

15:10.820 --> 15:14.555
- Although it might feel good.
- I don't feel good right now.

15:14.794 --> 15:18.666
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

15:20.271 --> 15:22.173
You up to the task, sailor?

15:25.683 --> 15:27.915
Oh, my God..

15:36.237 --> 15:39.004
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

15:39.209 --> 15:43.981
Well, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

15:44.587 --> 15:46.249
Joey asked me to marry him.

15:46.591 --> 15:48.457
- What?
- Joey proposed to me.

15:48.695 --> 15:53.068
- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
- Well, I said yes.

15:53.271 --> 15:56.038
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby!

15:58.147 --> 16:01.518
I'm sensing you won't throw the shower?

16:01.688 --> 16:05.491
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.398
It is bigger than mine!

16:08.869 --> 16:12.934
I know. Days of our Lives,
thank you very much.

16:13.110 --> 16:15.513
- You can't marry him.
- Why not?

16:15.683 --> 16:19.178
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

16:19.356 --> 16:20.848
And he loves me so much.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.289
Well, do you love him?

16:23.799 --> 16:24.892
Sure.

16:26.705 --> 16:30.770
- Sure?
- Yeah, I mean, whatever.

16:31.146 --> 16:34.984
If you're worried about breaking his heart,
it's still broken from the last time.

16:35.154 --> 16:38.320
So really, you're just taking
the already broken pieces..

16:38.494 --> 16:42.229
and breaking them into smaller,
more manageable pieces.

16:43.371 --> 16:45.102
Okay, forget that.

16:45.274 --> 16:48.007
Honey, the question is..

16:48.180 --> 16:49.877
do you really want to marry Joey?

16:51.788 --> 16:53.519
No.

16:53.692 --> 16:56.528
No, I don't.

16:58.802 --> 17:02.572
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

17:03.010 --> 17:05.344
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?

17:05.516 --> 17:07.884
No. She had the ring on..

17:08.087 --> 17:11.116
she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

17:11.828 --> 17:16.532
Joey, you have to tell her what's
going on. And what did it look like?

17:16.704 --> 17:19.140
I didn't look at it.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.643
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.382
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.

17:25.556 --> 17:28.995
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

17:29.162 --> 17:31.793
I don't want to hurt her.

17:32.168 --> 17:34.503
Okay, look, just do it gently.

17:35.876 --> 17:36.901
You're right.

17:37.078 --> 17:41.075
You're right. I'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

17:41.253 --> 17:45.489
I can do that. I am a gentle person.

17:45.662 --> 17:50.035
By the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

17:58.354 --> 17:59.948
Hey.

18:00.158 --> 18:01.855
Hey.

18:06.303 --> 18:08.205
Listen, I heard about the engagement.

18:09.577 --> 18:10.977
Surprised?

18:12.182 --> 18:14.949
And confused.

18:17.893 --> 18:21.195
Rach, sweetie..

18:22.368 --> 18:23.962
I didn't propose to you.

18:25.374 --> 18:27.709
I know.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.783
I don't think you do.

18:34.059 --> 18:36.690
You didn't propose to me.

18:36.864 --> 18:39.426
Joey did.

18:39.704 --> 18:43.143
Poor baby, you're so tired.

18:44.179 --> 18:49.383
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

18:49.557 --> 18:52.529
Joey didn't propose to you.

18:52.696 --> 18:57.798
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

18:59.744 --> 19:02.112
You didn't propose to me.

19:02.282 --> 19:05.379
Chandler didn't propose to me.

19:05.555 --> 19:07.319
But Joey did.

19:07.826 --> 19:10.490
Joey proposed to you?

19:10.666 --> 19:14.036
- I can come back.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

19:14.239 --> 19:17.735
- Joey, did you propose to her?
- No.

19:18.147 --> 19:22.349
- Yes, you did.
- Actually, technically, I didn't.

19:22.589 --> 19:26.028
- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
- Wait.

19:26.196 --> 19:32.631
- You gave her the ring?
- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

19:32.843 --> 19:34.209
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

19:34.379 --> 19:35.609
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

19:35.816 --> 19:38.720
Yes, you did, and don't
you say you didn't!

19:38.888 --> 19:41.826
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

19:41.994 --> 19:44.362
- You were down on one knee?
- Yeah, that looks bad.

19:44.533 --> 19:49.099
But I didn't propose.

19:49.309 --> 19:52.008
- Then what did happen?
- Yeah, what did happen?

19:52.215 --> 19:55.312
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up..

19:55.488 --> 19:58.859
and you thought I was proposing.

19:59.062 --> 20:03.162
Yeah, but you said,
"Will you marry me?"

20:03.370 --> 20:05.237
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

20:05.441 --> 20:08.778
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

20:15.060 --> 20:17.623
- Why didn't you tell me that before?
- Well, I tried..

20:17.800 --> 20:22.241
but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

20:24.780 --> 20:27.307
You saw her breast?

20:27.485 --> 20:31.620
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.768
Then what the hell were you doing
with an engagement ring?

20:35.969 --> 20:38.566
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.

20:38.775 --> 20:43.409
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.984
What?!

20:46.423 --> 20:48.154
You were gonna propose to me?

20:53.638 --> 20:55.038
No.

21:05.294 --> 21:07.025
Well, this is awkward.

21:09.168 --> 21:15.010
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

21:15.180 --> 21:21.056
- But that, I mean, that was all, Rach.
- Dude, step up. I proposed.

21:21.226 --> 21:23.025
No, you didn't.

21:23.196 --> 21:28.731
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

21:30.812 --> 21:33.442
All right, so let me just get this clear.

21:33.618 --> 21:36.054
You didn't propose.

21:36.222 --> 21:38.523
You weren't gonna propose.

21:39.797 --> 21:42.165
So this morning,
I didn't have a boyfriend..

21:42.335 --> 21:45.934
and somehow I got dumped
twice today.

21:47.946 --> 21:53.618
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.
Why don't we give this another try?

21:54.526 --> 21:56.962
Here we go again.

21:57.866 --> 22:00.336
I can't believe you told her
I was gonna propose.

22:00.505 --> 22:04.308
- I can't believe you're not gonna.
- Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

22:04.513 --> 22:06.540
Yeah, dude, I totally understand.

22:06.717 --> 22:10.178
Usually after I have a baby with
a woman, I like to slow things down!

22:11.560 --> 22:12.960
- Oh, my God!
- What?

22:13.196 --> 22:14.893
She's doing it!
She's breast-feeding!

22:15.602 --> 22:18.437
It's beautiful.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.134
- I'll come back for her later.
- Thank you.

22:21.847 --> 22:27.758
- Wow, this feels weird.
- What, good weird?

22:27.959 --> 22:29.986
Wonderful weird.

22:31.299 --> 22:34.169
You know what, you guys?
I'm gonna go too.

22:34.372 --> 22:38.609
And I'm sorry about everything.

22:38.815 --> 22:42.653
- Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
- No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.

22:42.823 --> 22:44.520
It's just that..

22:44.693 --> 22:46.595
Man, that kid is going to town!

23:01.560 --> 23:03.723
She's perfect.

23:03.931 --> 23:06.163
We're so lucky.

23:06.369 --> 23:08.498
We really are.

23:12.816 --> 23:18.020
Look, I know it's not a proposal,
and I don't know where you are..

23:18.193 --> 23:22.099
but with everything that's been
going on and with Emma, I'm..

23:22.268 --> 23:26.208
- I've been feeling..
- Yeah, I know.

23:26.376 --> 23:28.243
I've been feeling..

23:28.413 --> 23:30.246
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:32.254 --> 23:35.226
Okay, well, that..
Wow, okay, well..

23:35.394 --> 23:39.061
Then maybe at least we can
talk about us again?

23:40.872 --> 23:43.399
Yeah. Maybe.

23:43.578 --> 23:45.741
Well, good. Okay.

23:45.915 --> 23:49.719
I kind of think, you know, if we, if..

23:52.529 --> 23:55.763
You're wearing the ring.

24:00.979 --> 24:02.539
What's that?

24:05.120 --> 24:08.582
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.703
I'm sorry, what?

24:15.474 --> 24:20.212
When you thought Joey proposed..

24:20.518 --> 24:22.180
did you say yes?

24:33.577 --> 24:39.179
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

24:40.257 --> 24:42.956
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

24:47.973 --> 24:52.574
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

24:55.621 --> 24:57.385
Thank you.
