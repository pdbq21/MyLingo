WEBVTT

00:06.706 --> 00:11.200
Morning's here

00:11.611 --> 00:13.772
The morning's here

00:14.147 --> 00:16.047
Sunshine is here

00:16.716 --> 00:18.081
The sky is clear

00:18.351 --> 00:20.581
The morning's here

00:20.854 --> 00:22.549
The morning's here

00:22.789 --> 00:24.120
Hey!

00:24.824 --> 00:28.385
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

00:28.828 --> 00:30.261
Oh, come on!

00:30.497 --> 00:32.192
Morning's here!

00:44.077 --> 00:46.204
I hate this apartment!

00:47.680 --> 00:51.878
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!

00:54.054 --> 00:55.783
I hate that singing guy!

00:55.989 --> 00:58.651
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

00:59.526 --> 01:01.960
Morning's here

01:03.196 --> 01:04.390
Stop it!

01:06.066 --> 01:07.294
I will kill you.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.462
I hate that my room is so small.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.368
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.477
You don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

01:21.381 --> 01:23.679
I am tired of your bellyaching.

01:23.883 --> 01:27.011
I've worked hard to make this
a nice place for us.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.485
I know.
I'm so sorry.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.316
I'm sorry, okay?

01:31.724 --> 01:33.021
It's a great apartment!

01:33.226 --> 01:35.057
Shut up!
This place is a hole!

01:37.697 --> 01:39.824
The One with All the Haste

02:28.381 --> 02:31.441
I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

02:31.651 --> 02:34.620
I know, I know.
Who am l? David Bowie?

02:37.023 --> 02:38.115
He does that?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.951
I don't know. Whatever.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.590
I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.286
Oh, I know.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.826
You know what?

02:48.034 --> 02:51.868
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.504
When I'm with you, I'm like...

02:54.707 --> 02:57.505
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

02:57.777 --> 02:59.836
I mean, I love you too.
A lot.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.241
But that guy!

03:02.448 --> 03:03.710
I love that guy!

03:03.983 --> 03:05.780
I love both of you.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.014
I wish I didn't have to go.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.120
Then don't.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.988
Stay here.
Don't go so soon to London.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.754
Just one more day.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.955
Please don't do this to me again.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.797
I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.064
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.635
I wish I could.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.806
Oh, no. Don't start packing.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.072
Come on!

03:39.419 --> 03:42.320
I don't think you understand packing.

03:43.056 --> 03:48.153
I don't want to leave it till last.
Last time, I left my knickers here.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.329
Yeah, I know.
I tried them on.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.330
You didn't!

03:53.533 --> 03:56.001
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

04:10.883 --> 04:11.872
Excuse me?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.677
Your pants.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.854
Oh yeah! You like them?

04:16.322 --> 04:19.689
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.360
These are so comfortable.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.761
Pheebs, those are Santa pants.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.194
Santa pants.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.904
Santa Claus' pants.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.674
No. They're maternity pants.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.278
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

04:42.582 --> 04:45.244
These names are good,
and these are bad.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.452
Hey, Phoebes.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.794
So, how are the elves?

04:57.397 --> 05:00.764
I don't know.
How are the...you know?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.104
Your clothes aren't funny.

05:06.739 --> 05:09.435
What should I wear to a Knicks game?

05:09.909 --> 05:12.469
A T-shirt that says,
"l Don't Belong Here"?

05:14.714 --> 05:15.772
You have tickets?

05:15.982 --> 05:20.214
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.581
Apparently, they're good seats.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.222
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

05:25.391 --> 05:28.451
I could slip Woody Allen my resume.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.289
Do you guys want these?

05:30.963 --> 05:32.863
Yeah, we do!

05:33.533 --> 05:34.693
Well, you got them!

05:35.768 --> 05:38.100
Just give us our apartment back.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.175
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.100
Are you serious?

05:46.312 --> 05:50.009
Come on.
We know what these are worth.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.308
Do you think we're stupid?

05:52.652 --> 05:55.849
Not stupid.
You're meaner than I thought.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.678
What do you say?

05:57.857 --> 06:02.453
Forget it. I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.788
Your "bachelor pad"?

06:05.231 --> 06:07.222
Have you even had a girl here?

06:09.602 --> 06:10.591
No.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.665
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.643
Yeah, you do!

06:25.685 --> 06:27.152
Come on!

06:27.420 --> 06:30.685
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.319
Good one.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.151
Come on.
Season tickets!

06:35.361 --> 06:37.522
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

06:37.730 --> 06:39.721
I'm not giving up the apartment.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.665
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

06:44.904 --> 06:48.601
...to the No. 1 salesman
every year. My dad never won.

06:49.208 --> 06:53.076
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

06:54.414 --> 06:55.745
Hey guys!

06:57.850 --> 06:58.942
Oh, my God!

07:00.386 --> 07:02.684
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

07:03.790 --> 07:06.258
Oh, yeah.
Emily convinced me to do it.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.692
You do know that Wham broke up?

07:13.199 --> 07:15.963
I like it. Emily likes it.
That's what counts.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.197
So, how are you guys doing?

07:20.406 --> 07:23.864
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.309
Where's Emily?

07:26.813 --> 07:28.644
She's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.372
Didn't she, like, just get here?

07:32.752 --> 07:33.878
Easy, tiger.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.385
I just hate this so much.

07:36.589 --> 07:40.548
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.663
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

07:45.932 --> 07:48.332
-So what'll you do?
-There's nothing to do.

07:48.568 --> 07:50.399
She lives there.
I live here.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.833
She'd have to move here.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.967
She should move here.

07:55.808 --> 07:56.797
What?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.577
-I can ask her to live with me.
-Are you serious?

07:59.812 --> 08:03.077
-I mean, why not?
-You've only known her six weeks!

08:03.282 --> 08:07.241
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

08:08.454 --> 08:11.480
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like....

08:11.991 --> 08:15.154
She brings out this great side of me.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.063
I mean, I love her, you know?

08:18.264 --> 08:20.255
And I love the milk!

08:21.167 --> 08:24.432
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.966
Joey, you say things now.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.276
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

08:35.715 --> 08:36.704
She's great!

08:36.949 --> 08:39.679
But this is too soon.
You'll only scare her.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.985
I don't want to do that.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.351
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.055
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.158
I'm not going to do it.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.822
-Thanks guys.
-No problem.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.864
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.012
It's too hard. Too hard!

09:11.651 --> 09:14.142
All right.
Last chance for the tickets.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.914
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.158
No, thank you.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.690
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.991
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

09:30.369 --> 09:34.396
I want those seats. But we can't live
in the small apartment...

09:34.607 --> 09:37.576
...after living here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?

09:39.779 --> 09:41.576
Ever read Sports Illustrated?

09:43.616 --> 09:45.447
No, I didn't read yours!

09:45.751 --> 09:47.412
We can go to the game tonight!

09:47.620 --> 09:49.884
The only way I'll consider this is...

09:50.089 --> 09:52.580
...if they offer more
than just season seats.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.258
-It's the Knicks!
-Screw the Knicks!

10:00.533 --> 10:03.093
I didn't mean that.
I just meant that...

10:03.302 --> 10:06.271
...the apartment is worth
so much more.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.436
And the Knicks rule.

10:11.644 --> 10:12.975
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.377
So? Are you going to do it?

10:17.717 --> 10:20.880
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.142
All right, look.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.381
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

10:25.591 --> 10:26.615
Done!

10:27.460 --> 10:30.725
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.157
We could get nothing.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.660
Or everything.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.298
I like that.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.993
What do you say?

10:38.971 --> 10:39.960
Just do it!

10:40.172 --> 10:41.730
Oh! I'm convinced!

10:43.843 --> 10:46.971
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.645
Because you're my best friend.

10:50.516 --> 10:54.418
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.944
I'm in.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.950
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.286
We should let Phoebe decide...

11:02.495 --> 11:06.522
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

11:10.703 --> 11:11.829
I have a game!

11:12.371 --> 11:14.931
-This is great!
-What's the game?

11:15.207 --> 11:18.199
It doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

11:20.112 --> 11:22.171
No, it doesn't have a name.

11:25.151 --> 11:28.848
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

11:31.023 --> 11:33.321
-They're green?
-Good! Five points!

11:39.999 --> 11:41.796
Same question.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.331
-They're tall.
-Three points!

11:49.975 --> 11:54.469
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.146
That's not even a game.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.409
Shut up. We're winning!

12:02.221 --> 12:04.746
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.685
High card wins.
What do you say?

12:06.892 --> 12:09.156
-Let's do it!
-Oh, I have cards!

12:09.361 --> 12:10.828
Yeah. Here.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.894
No, these are the trick deck.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.590
Here, yes.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.500
Okay, you guys pick first.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.742
-Four.
-That's a low one!

12:29.115 --> 12:30.605
You look.
I can't do it.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.851
What makes you think I can?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.576
Ace!

12:40.025 --> 12:41.458
Why are you hugging?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.184
We won our apartment back!

12:43.462 --> 12:46.727
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

12:46.932 --> 12:49.628
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

12:57.476 --> 12:58.773
I don't know.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.540
Look it!

13:07.119 --> 13:08.313
Come on, pick again!

13:11.824 --> 13:14.452
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.822
I know queen is high!

13:20.266 --> 13:21.733
Not as high as....

13:23.002 --> 13:24.731
It worked! King!

13:27.740 --> 13:29.332
We pick again!
We pick again!

13:29.608 --> 13:31.098
-Why?
-I don't know.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.445
Tickets, please.

13:36.682 --> 13:37.808
Courtside, baby!

13:40.019 --> 13:42.749
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

13:44.290 --> 13:47.953
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.090
No, they didn't.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.503
Packed while you were gone.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.106
I left knickers under your pillow.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.604
Move in with me?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.337
What?

14:10.549 --> 14:15.282
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

14:15.487 --> 14:20.288
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.489
I don't know.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.061
Leaving London....

14:28.334 --> 14:30.302
My whole family lives there....

14:30.536 --> 14:33.300
-My job.
-You'll get a job here.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.566
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.675
That could be you.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.206
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.345
You come to England.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.542
I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

14:47.753 --> 14:51.712
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

14:53.592 --> 14:54.718
I don't think so.

14:56.528 --> 14:59.759
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

14:59.999 --> 15:02.399
...and we were getting married.

15:02.601 --> 15:03.590
What?

15:04.737 --> 15:09.504
Right. I shouldn't have said "married."
Please don't go freaky on me.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.037
I didn't mean it.
I take it back.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.576
No. Don't.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.005
Why don't we?

15:19.184 --> 15:20.446
Why don't we what?

15:22.888 --> 15:24.515
Get married.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.014
You are mad!

15:27.226 --> 15:32.027
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.392
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.159
-We've known each other six weeks!
-I know.

15:38.370 --> 15:42.033
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

15:42.274 --> 15:46.404
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

15:46.612 --> 15:49.911
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.942
I mean, this....

15:54.620 --> 15:56.986
This makes sense for us.

15:58.257 --> 16:02.921
Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.188
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Me!

16:08.000 --> 16:09.490
This feels right.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.325
Doesn't it?

16:13.172 --> 16:15.504
My parents will be really mad.

16:15.841 --> 16:18.401
Are you saying, "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

16:19.178 --> 16:20.167
Yes.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.912
-We're getting married!
-Oh, my God!

16:28.487 --> 16:29.977
We're getting married!

16:31.290 --> 16:32.689
Come here, come here.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.601
Emily, will you marry me?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.175
It's a bit small.

16:54.446 --> 16:57.381
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.948
It was.

17:13.399 --> 17:16.300
Those were, like,
the best seats ever!

17:16.502 --> 17:20.063
Should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

17:20.339 --> 17:23.536
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

17:29.248 --> 17:30.579
Oh, God!

17:37.189 --> 17:38.622
Hey, you want a beer?

17:42.428 --> 17:43.656
I know!

17:46.965 --> 17:49.160
Open up! Open up! Open up!

17:50.536 --> 17:52.663
We'll discuss it in the morning.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.338
What the hell is going on?

18:03.248 --> 18:06.012
We took our apartment back!

18:09.621 --> 18:11.316
I had nothing to do with it.

18:14.660 --> 18:18.255
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.029
We are switching back right now.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.268
No, we're not.
We're not leaving!

18:27.473 --> 18:29.532
You'll have to.
You both have jobs.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.233
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.

18:33.545 --> 18:36.036
-Right, Joe?
-I don't know.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.144
What?

18:41.653 --> 18:44.053
I don't want to move again, with....

18:46.225 --> 18:48.955
This is our apartment
and they stole

18:49.161 --> 18:50.992
You stole!

18:51.530 --> 18:54.556
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

18:54.800 --> 18:58.668
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

19:00.072 --> 19:01.061
All right.

19:02.508 --> 19:06.968
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

19:07.212 --> 19:10.181
No more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

19:10.482 --> 19:14.714
-Let us keep the apartment and
-As a thank you...

19:18.056 --> 19:20.991
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.731
-Totally worth it!
-That was one good minute!

19:27.933 --> 19:28.991
Good night.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.503
-Men are such idiots.
-I know.

19:37.709 --> 19:42.339
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

19:42.548 --> 19:45.779
If you had just done that
after the last contest...

19:46.018 --> 19:48.213
...no one would have
had to move at all.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.753
Let's pretend that's not true.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.552
Scarf's done.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.799
Come on, come on!

20:07.139 --> 20:08.128
What's going on?

20:08.373 --> 20:11.035
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.638
Emily and l, we decided...

20:17.916 --> 20:19.144
...to get married.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.646
What?

20:24.122 --> 20:26.454
Oh, are you pregnant too?

20:28.493 --> 20:29.551
No.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.960
When did
How did you

20:33.465 --> 20:36.298
We just decided to go for it.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.833
We know it's a bit hasty...

20:39.771 --> 20:41.932
...but it just feels so right.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.838
I was just telling the guys

20:49.081 --> 20:51.106
Yeah, I heard.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.020
I think it's great!

20:59.958 --> 21:01.323
I'm so happy for you!

21:01.526 --> 21:03.460
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!

21:12.271 --> 21:14.637
I can't believe
you're getting married!

21:18.677 --> 21:20.702
Monica and Rachel made out.

21:30.589 --> 21:34.685
Morning's here

21:34.926 --> 21:37.417
The morning's here

21:37.696 --> 21:40.494
Sunshine is here

21:40.699 --> 21:41.927
The sky is clear

21:42.467 --> 21:44.901
The morning's here

21:45.103 --> 21:48.072
-Hey, you're back!
-Hey, get into gear

21:48.674 --> 21:50.437
Breakfast is near

21:50.642 --> 21:55.739
The dark of night has disappeared

21:55.981 --> 21:57.812
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
