WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:02.645
Thanks for coming by.

00:02.881 --> 00:06.977
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

00:07.953 --> 00:10.854
-What's the matter? Are you okay?
-It's just....

00:11.123 --> 00:13.648
Monica said, ''wedding.''

00:14.493 --> 00:17.155
We thought one of you
couId read something.

00:18.196 --> 00:21.723
I wouId Iove to read a poem.

00:23.101 --> 00:25.695
Do you think you couId
get through a poem?

00:26.371 --> 00:28.532
A short one.

00:29.107 --> 00:32.133
Okay, so Ross wiII be doing the reading.

00:32.611 --> 00:36.172
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

00:37.616 --> 00:39.106
Too?

00:39.818 --> 00:43.185
I kind of have something eIse
pIanned for you guys.

00:43.855 --> 00:46.187
-Do you mind teIIing us what it is?
-Sorry.

00:46.458 --> 00:49.723
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the <i>q</i>.t.

00:52.097 --> 00:54.725
Whatever it is,
I hope it invoIves winking.

00:57.169 --> 00:58.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:58.770 --> 01:00.829
I taIked to one of the <i>DOOL</i> writers--

01:01.106 --> 01:03.131
-What is <i>DOOL</i>?
-<i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

01:05.243 --> 01:08.974
You're not gonna beIieve it. My character
is coming out of his coma!

01:09.247 --> 01:11.181
-That's wonderfuI.
-Wow, Joey.

01:11.450 --> 01:15.147
And not onIy that,
I'm getting a new brain!

01:16.254 --> 01:20.281
So great things are happening at work
and in your personaI Iife.

01:21.526 --> 01:23.016
You're getting a new brain?

01:23.295 --> 01:25.991
They're kiIIing off
one of the characters on the show...

01:26.198 --> 01:29.167
...and her brain is being transpIanted
into my body.

01:31.069 --> 01:34.505
What? A brain transpIant?

01:34.773 --> 01:37.640
Yes, it's a highIy controversiaI procedure.

01:38.443 --> 01:40.775
It's ridicuIous.

01:41.446 --> 01:44.643
It's ridicuIous that you
haven't had se<i>x</i> in three and a haIf months.

01:49.855 --> 01:53.621
It's winter.
There are fewer peopIe on the street.

01:57.529 --> 01:58.757
Who are they kiIIing off?

01:58.930 --> 02:01.421
CeciIia Monroe.
She pIays Jessica Lockhart.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.134
No!

02:03.669 --> 02:07.105
She's my favorite character on <i>DOOL.</i>

02:07.906 --> 02:08.964
Nice.

02:10.409 --> 02:14.004
She is so good at throwing drinks
in peopIe's faces.

02:14.246 --> 02:16.908
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a beverage.

02:17.182 --> 02:19.707
The way she sIaps peopIe.
WouIdn't you Iove to do that?

02:19.985 --> 02:21.475
Don't do it.

02:22.954 --> 02:26.048
-CeciIia Monroe, what a great actress.
-TeII me about it.

02:26.224 --> 02:28.089
And she's been on the show forever.

02:28.293 --> 02:30.921
It's gonna be reaIIy hard
to fiII her shoes.

02:31.430 --> 02:32.624
HeIp me out here.

02:32.898 --> 02:37.392
When you come out
of the brain transpIant...

02:38.036 --> 02:40.504
...you are going to be her?

02:40.739 --> 02:43.640
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

02:47.379 --> 02:51.315
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.678
The One With Joey's New Brain

03:31.823 --> 03:33.586
Rach, so that guy there...

03:33.825 --> 03:34.917
...straight or gay?

03:36.995 --> 03:40.021
WeII, I'd have to say gay.

03:40.198 --> 03:41.756
Yeah? Why?

03:41.933 --> 03:45.528
MainIy because he's kissing
that other guy.

03:45.837 --> 03:49.432
Oh, no, not that guy there.
That guy right there.

03:51.143 --> 03:54.135
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight.

03:55.547 --> 03:57.606
Knockers wiII heIp us
figure it out.

04:03.321 --> 04:05.050
AII right, straight.

04:05.824 --> 04:07.621
And not subtIe.

04:10.629 --> 04:12.597
He Ieft his ceII phone.

04:12.764 --> 04:15.426
We couId hand it to Gunther
to put it in Iost and found.

04:15.667 --> 04:19.296
Or we couId use it to caII China,
see how those guys are doing.

04:20.005 --> 04:23.168
What if he caIIs his own ceII phone
and I answer...

04:23.441 --> 04:26.808
...and we start taIking
and we feII in Iove?

04:27.012 --> 04:29.173
WouIdn't that be a great story?

04:29.447 --> 04:32.245
Kind of Iike a fairy taIe
for the digitaI age.

04:33.018 --> 04:35.145
That does sound great.
I'm gonna get the phone.

04:35.420 --> 04:38.685
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

04:38.924 --> 04:41.620
I haven't been
out on a date in so Iong.

04:41.893 --> 04:44.327
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

04:44.596 --> 04:49.158
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having se<i>x</i>.

04:49.434 --> 04:51.527
Okay. Great. I get the phone.

04:51.803 --> 04:54.931
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

04:55.173 --> 05:00.440
Yeah, and untiI now, I didn't think
I wouId Iove again.

05:01.446 --> 05:02.708
-Nice try.
-Wait.

05:02.981 --> 05:06.041
How do we fairIy decide
who gets the phone?

05:06.318 --> 05:08.115
I don't know.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.494
Maybe we couId....

05:18.530 --> 05:19.861
Aha! Too sIow!

05:22.167 --> 05:24.863
Aha! Too cocky.

05:29.207 --> 05:31.641
I'm dating him.
There's nothing you can do.

05:31.843 --> 05:32.867
Yes, there is.

05:33.144 --> 05:36.375
What are you going to do, kiII him?
Like you did CharIes?

05:36.648 --> 05:39.014
That was an accident.

05:39.718 --> 05:42.050
And so were you.

05:43.555 --> 05:46.023
WeII, at Ieast I'm not a murderer.

05:47.459 --> 05:50.223
Oh, my baby.

05:54.666 --> 05:56.065
<i>Cut!</i>

06:00.272 --> 06:04.834
That was a great scene. That sIap Iooked
so reaI. How do you do that?

06:05.043 --> 06:08.706
-Oh, just years of e<i>x</i>perience.
-Can I get some ice here?!

06:10.415 --> 06:13.213
I just wanted to say how wonderfuI
I think you are.

06:13.585 --> 06:16.076
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

06:17.188 --> 06:19.588
I'm supposed to meet
and hug a fan who's dying.

06:19.758 --> 06:22.693
But that's not suppose to be untiI Iater.

06:22.861 --> 06:25.887
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

06:26.131 --> 06:29.498
-I'm the guy in the coma.
-Oh, that was a reaI person?

06:31.736 --> 06:35.638
Since I'm getting your brain
when you Ieave the show...

06:35.874 --> 06:37.739
...I was wondering if--

06:37.976 --> 06:41.468
-I'm Ieaving the show?
-Why? Did you hear something?

06:43.949 --> 06:46.179
Who toId you that?

06:46.751 --> 06:49.948
-One of the writers.
-Which writer? Was it baId or was it taII?

06:50.922 --> 06:54.050
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

06:54.292 --> 06:55.384
Okay.

06:55.660 --> 06:59.289
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

06:59.531 --> 07:02.227
...about a character I've pIayed
for 20 years!

07:07.605 --> 07:10.233
Miss Monroe--
Oh, there you go.

07:22.187 --> 07:26.351
No, Phoebe, you cannot get the phone
that way. That's not fair.

07:26.524 --> 07:27.821
Okay, Iook, I have an idea.

07:28.059 --> 07:31.825
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed diaI...

07:31.997 --> 07:37.128
...and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.

07:37.469 --> 07:42.429
Or we can decide by whoever's name
is cIoser to the word ''phone.''

07:45.610 --> 07:47.100
I don't think so.

07:47.979 --> 07:52.882
Fine. But I bet you'd be singing a different
tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.

07:54.786 --> 07:57.949
First name on the speed diaI is ''Mom.''

07:58.189 --> 08:01.522
Oh. I Iost my mom to suicide.

08:02.160 --> 08:06.028
No way. You can't use that to get the cute
guy and the Iast bIueberry muffin.

08:06.197 --> 08:08.757
Did I use that aIready today? I'm sorry.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.393
WeII, now, see,
this isn't teIIing us anything.

08:12.570 --> 08:18.907
-''Joe. CarIos. Yoga. Ben--''
-Wait. I do yoga. That's one for me.

08:19.077 --> 08:21.978
Oh, aII right.
Oh, so cIose. If onIy it said, ''yogurt.''

08:24.582 --> 08:26.641
''Peter Luger.'' That's a steak house.

08:27.018 --> 08:30.886
Okay, fine. Meat-eater.
Fine, that's one for you.

08:31.956 --> 08:35.392
Oh, I win. He's got Barneys
on his speed diaI.

08:35.627 --> 08:38.061
You don't know it's Barneys
the store.

08:38.296 --> 08:40.890
That couId be his friend's
house or a bar--

08:41.132 --> 08:43.293
Who has Barneys the store
on their speed diaI?

08:43.568 --> 08:45.627
His new girIfriend.

09:03.755 --> 09:04.949
What is that?

09:05.190 --> 09:07.886
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

09:10.095 --> 09:12.723
Sounds Iike it's coming
from across the street.

09:13.198 --> 09:16.463
-Oh, my God.
-What?

09:16.701 --> 09:19.033
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

09:19.270 --> 09:22.967
He was hanging out with me and said,
''You're haIf Scottish, right?''

09:24.075 --> 09:26.202
-No.
-Yes!

09:37.055 --> 09:40.889
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

09:50.568 --> 09:54.129
UnbeIievabIe.
Why is your famiIy Scottish?

09:55.473 --> 09:58.203
Why is your famiIy Ross?

09:59.744 --> 10:02.269
He cannot pIay at our wedding.
Everyone wiII Ieave.

10:02.447 --> 10:05.712
It'II be Iike when he rapped
at my bat mitzvah.

10:06.417 --> 10:10.410
We can't just teII him no. He's probabIy
been practicing forever. He'II be crushed.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.580
Maybe there's a way we can teII him
without hurting his feeIings.

10:13.758 --> 10:16.454
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

10:17.262 --> 10:19.127
It's not even a song.

10:20.198 --> 10:22.723
Wait. If you Iisten very carefuIIy...

10:22.934 --> 10:25.960
...I think it's ''CeIebration''
by KooI and the Gang.

10:39.184 --> 10:41.482
-Hi. How are you?
-Good.

10:41.686 --> 10:44.154
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

10:44.422 --> 10:47.448
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

10:47.759 --> 10:52.253
I was gonna keep it in my purse so if
it rang, I couId just pick it up?

10:53.298 --> 10:57.667
Do you remember going into my purse
and steaIing the phone?

10:59.137 --> 11:00.468
Now you Iost me.

11:00.972 --> 11:03.065
-You stoIe the phone.
-No, I didn't.

11:03.308 --> 11:06.300
You're saying that if I caIIed it,
it wouIdn't ring?

11:06.578 --> 11:07.636
-No.
-Okay.

11:07.912 --> 11:12.440
But whiIe you diaI, Iet me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

11:14.185 --> 11:16.176
Oh, it does work.

11:17.622 --> 11:19.556
-Phoebe.
-That is a different phone.

11:19.791 --> 11:24.558
Oh, is it? HeIIo. Yes, hi,
is RacheI there?

11:24.762 --> 11:28.163
Yes, she is. Just one moment, pIease.
It's for me!

11:30.168 --> 11:31.965
That is damning evidence.

11:34.005 --> 11:37.065
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

11:37.475 --> 11:39.636
My digitaI fairy taIe's
about to begin.

11:41.112 --> 11:44.377
I wonder how it shouId be?
ShouId I be, ''HeIIo''?

11:44.549 --> 11:46.710
Or shouId I be, ''Hi! It's Ra--''?

11:47.118 --> 11:49.518
WouId you stop doing that?

11:49.754 --> 11:52.621
HeIIo? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

11:52.890 --> 11:55.586
-Phoebe, you can't--
-I'm on a caII.

11:57.762 --> 12:01.664
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?

12:01.933 --> 12:04.766
At my apartment.

12:04.969 --> 12:08.496
It's 5 Morton Street,
apartment 1 4.

12:08.773 --> 12:12.869
And then maybe, you know, after,
we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

12:13.144 --> 12:15.442
Okay. Okay, I'II see you then. Bye.

12:17.949 --> 12:20.383
You do know that I wiII be here
when he comes over.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.813
How wiII you know what time
to come over?

12:23.087 --> 12:25.351
You just said it.

12:30.361 --> 12:34.855
WeII, I was kind of hoping
that I wouId just be aIone.

12:35.033 --> 12:38.560
You know, to think about my mom
and her suicide.

12:38.736 --> 12:41.796
-Oh, Phoebe!
-What? That's the first time today.

12:47.845 --> 12:49.642
So you Iike the nachos, huh?

12:49.814 --> 12:51.577
-MyseIf, I'm partiaI to--
-I'm 1 6.

12:51.749 --> 12:53.410
See you in 2003.

12:57.322 --> 13:00.314
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.

13:00.558 --> 13:03.959
They don't know e<i>x</i>actIy when
it's going to happen, but soon...

13:04.195 --> 13:05.753
...and then that's it.

13:06.030 --> 13:09.022
I'm so sorry. If it was up to me,
you wouId never Ieave the show.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.360
-Yeah, thanks.
-I mean it.

13:11.602 --> 13:14.867
I can't beIieve they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

13:15.073 --> 13:19.476
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They Iove you so much.

13:20.078 --> 13:21.978
Oh, you're right.

13:22.613 --> 13:23.875
Thank you.

13:24.115 --> 13:25.912
What's your name again?

13:27.051 --> 13:28.746
-Joey.
-Thank you.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.181
That is so sweet.

13:31.522 --> 13:33.353
E<i>x</i>cuse me.

13:35.793 --> 13:39.354
-It wasn't my decision.
-I'm having a conversation here.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.596
You were saying.

13:43.835 --> 13:47.999
Look, the onIy reason
I came up to you before...

13:48.172 --> 13:50.163
...is because, weII...

13:50.341 --> 13:53.003
...I'm reaIIy nervous about being you.

13:53.578 --> 13:58.015
If you couId heIp me capture
the essence of the character, you know.

13:58.182 --> 14:00.878
HeIp me keep Jessica aIive.
PIease?

14:03.354 --> 14:04.821
AII right, Joey, I'II heIp you.

14:05.089 --> 14:08.525
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

14:08.793 --> 14:11.956
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

14:12.130 --> 14:14.928
-Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
-You're so weIcome.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.828
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

14:18.770 --> 14:22.228
Jessica Lockhart wiII never
step foot in this pIace again!

14:22.473 --> 14:23.667
Never!

14:25.576 --> 14:28.306
-Is that supposed to be me?
-Yeah.

14:28.479 --> 14:32.006
But Jessica doesn't have
an EngIish accent.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.911
I can do an EngIish accent?

14:37.054 --> 14:39.147
That baby's going on my résumé.

14:43.327 --> 14:45.921
WeII, I feeI Iike a snack.

14:46.097 --> 14:49.726
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, Iike you are.

14:50.234 --> 14:54.330
Oh, no, thanks. I don't Iike anything
from my Scottish heritage.

14:54.605 --> 14:56.095
What?

14:56.774 --> 15:00.767
WeII, it's just that my entire famiIy
was run out of ScotIand by...

15:01.979 --> 15:03.503
...Vikings.

15:05.850 --> 15:08.114
Anyway, Iots of bad memories.

15:10.888 --> 15:16.724
It sounds to me Iike your famiIy's ready
to rediscover its Scottish roots.

15:16.894 --> 15:19.260
No. No, they're not.

15:19.430 --> 15:21.091
They're stiII very angry.

15:21.265 --> 15:23.790
But, you know, ChandIer's aIso
haIf-Swedish.

15:23.968 --> 15:26.766
You know what the Swedish peopIe
are famous for?

15:26.938 --> 15:29.498
Sitting down and being <i>q</i>uiet.

15:31.876 --> 15:34.743
Yeah, but the Scottish history
is so much--

15:34.912 --> 15:36.379
You can't pIay bagpipes
at the wedding!

15:39.183 --> 15:40.673
How did you know about that?

15:40.852 --> 15:45.755
-We heard you pIay from your apartment.
-Were you the ones who caIIed the cops?

15:47.492 --> 15:49.756
That's not reaIIy important right now.

15:49.994 --> 15:53.521
What is important is, whiIe we
appreciate the gesture...

15:53.731 --> 15:57.895
...we just don't feeI that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

15:58.169 --> 16:01.263
-Why not?
-Because we hate them.

16:01.906 --> 16:04.704
Come on, that's not fair.
You haven't even heard me pIay.

16:04.876 --> 16:07.310
We have heard you pIay.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.309
No, you've heard me practice.

16:09.480 --> 16:14.144
Just give me a chance to perform for
you, then decide whatever you want.

16:14.318 --> 16:17.776
I'm not gonna teII you what song
I'm gonna pIay either.

16:18.022 --> 16:19.853
Let's just say when it's over...

16:20.124 --> 16:23.992
...I'II bet there'II be
a wee bit of ceIebration.

16:30.401 --> 16:35.168
The essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

16:35.339 --> 16:38.172
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

16:38.442 --> 16:40.342
...she owns everything...

16:40.611 --> 16:44.274
...and every person in that room.

16:45.816 --> 16:47.613
-You try it.
-Okay.

16:54.091 --> 16:55.922
AII right!

16:56.827 --> 16:59.819
No. He aIready knows
that he owns everything in the room.

16:59.997 --> 17:02.591
He's not finding it out for the first time.

17:02.767 --> 17:05.327
-So try it again.
-Okay.

17:12.376 --> 17:15.004
He's not angry at the room either.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.406
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

17:19.584 --> 17:24.214
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

17:24.889 --> 17:27.119
It's a IittIe weird,
but it's getting better.

17:29.226 --> 17:33.390
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

17:33.664 --> 17:35.894
It's been 20 years of my Iife.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.859
Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

17:40.137 --> 17:44.096
It'II give you a chance to shake
things up. PIay different characters.

17:44.342 --> 17:45.707
You're so taIented.

17:45.876 --> 17:48.310
I am, I am.

17:48.479 --> 17:50.174
But I don't know. You know...

17:50.348 --> 17:54.876
...an actor of a certain age,
it's not that easy.

17:55.052 --> 18:00.718
That's not true. Look at AngeIa Lansbur--
AngeIina JoIie.

18:03.160 --> 18:07.859
ProbabIy shouId've just Ieft years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

18:08.099 --> 18:11.068
...but I just got
so comfy here and....

18:11.369 --> 18:14.065
I turned down some amazing work.

18:14.238 --> 18:15.569
Like what?

18:16.641 --> 18:19.337
WeII, Iet's just say
if I'd Ieft 1 5 years ago...

18:19.610 --> 18:24.138
...the Iandscape of Me<i>x</i>ican
cinema wouId be very different today.

18:26.150 --> 18:27.845
Wow.

18:29.286 --> 18:34.314
But, weII, now....
Now's a different time for me.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.153
Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

18:40.431 --> 18:42.661
Let me teII you something, okay?

18:42.933 --> 18:47.597
When I watch you do a scene,
I'm thinking, ''Boy, she is a great actress.''

18:47.838 --> 18:52.468
But I'm aIso thinking, ''She is hot.''

18:55.613 --> 18:57.706
You think I'm hot?

18:58.916 --> 19:00.679
You own the room.

19:05.289 --> 19:07.223
We shouId probabIy get the....

19:07.391 --> 19:09.552
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we shouId get--

19:13.864 --> 19:17.891
So when Jessica kisses a man...

19:18.903 --> 19:21.565
...she usuaIIy puts...

19:21.839 --> 19:25.104
...both her hands on the man's face.

19:25.276 --> 19:28.143
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

19:28.312 --> 19:31.679
No, it's because that way
the camera onIy sees her.

19:35.653 --> 19:37.518
You want to try it?

19:37.822 --> 19:39.813
Yeah, okay.

19:52.002 --> 19:54.596
That was good. That was reaIIy good.

19:56.273 --> 20:01.711
But I think that maybe your hands
are just a IittIe off. They shouId be right--

20:12.223 --> 20:13.986
Hey, hey!

20:15.693 --> 20:17.320
Who is it?

20:17.995 --> 20:20.259
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.

20:22.099 --> 20:24.567
Why do you get to answer the door?

20:24.802 --> 20:27.396
-Why shouIdn't I?
-Because it's my apartment.

20:27.638 --> 20:29.697
Then I get to give him the ceII phone.

20:29.940 --> 20:33.398
Okay. Good Iuck e<i>x</i>pIaining
aII the caIIs to China.

20:37.615 --> 20:38.877
Hi.

20:42.953 --> 20:45.251
Wow, how Iong were we arguing for?

20:49.794 --> 20:52.058
You're not the man who Ieft the phone.

20:52.229 --> 20:55.528
-No, that's my assistant.
-Is he coming?

20:56.467 --> 20:57.729
No.

20:58.002 --> 21:00.766
-CouId you give us one second?
-Sure.

21:01.038 --> 21:03.233
We'II be right back, sir.

21:04.708 --> 21:08.041
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

21:08.345 --> 21:09.710
Can you beIieve this?

21:09.980 --> 21:13.108
We were waiting for a hot guy,
and then an even hotter one shows up.

21:13.384 --> 21:14.715
I know.

21:18.556 --> 21:20.183
What?

21:21.292 --> 21:24.989
They just don't make them
Iike that anymore, you know?

21:27.398 --> 21:31.164
No, they do,
but you just have to wait.

21:32.970 --> 21:35.234
RacheI, Iisten...

21:35.406 --> 21:39.638
...if you Iet me have him,
then I wiII reaIIy owe you one.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.113
AII right.

21:45.983 --> 21:48.281
AII right, I wiII Iet you have him.

21:48.652 --> 21:50.711
But you owe me. You owe me big.

21:50.888 --> 21:53.789
Yeah. You're such a great friend.

21:54.959 --> 21:57.484
Which one of you IoveIy Iadies am I taking
to dinner?

21:57.761 --> 21:59.922
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

22:00.998 --> 22:03.694
-After you.
-Oh, thank you.

22:04.702 --> 22:05.930
Nice.

22:13.677 --> 22:17.044
WeII, you certainIy own that room.

22:19.250 --> 22:23.186
ActuaIIy, I rent the whoIe pIace.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.

22:26.590 --> 22:27.784
-Hi.
-Hey.

22:29.526 --> 22:30.891
Oh, my God.

22:31.495 --> 22:32.985
Oh, my God.

22:33.697 --> 22:37.531
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

22:37.701 --> 22:40.966
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

22:41.205 --> 22:42.502
It's nice to know--

22:42.740 --> 22:44.139
Monica!

22:46.010 --> 22:48.240
That's my roommate, RacheI.

22:48.512 --> 22:50.480
That e<i>x</i>pIains aII the women's underwear.

22:50.714 --> 22:52.306
Sure.

22:53.083 --> 22:56.177
Oh, my God, it's true!

22:57.221 --> 23:00.588
Oh, my God, you are so amazing.

23:01.392 --> 23:04.725
Can I just ask you to do me
just one favor?

23:04.895 --> 23:06.328
CertainIy.

23:06.630 --> 23:09.360
WouId you sIap me
right here in the face?

23:11.101 --> 23:15.037
I'd Iove to, but my Iawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

23:16.073 --> 23:19.531
God, you seem reaIIy, reaIIy nice.

23:19.743 --> 23:22.007
Okay, bye-bye.

23:22.780 --> 23:26.375
I mean, not fake at aII
Iike most famous peopIe.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.313
AII right, here we go.

23:28.552 --> 23:30.645
No, wait. Just one more thing.

23:32.790 --> 23:36.351
-You're a stupid bitch.
-I reaIIy can't sIap you.

23:36.527 --> 23:39.155
-You are so beautifuI.
-So nice to meet you.

23:39.330 --> 23:42.788
-My God, you're great.
-Thanks for stopping by.

23:44.702 --> 23:46.966
-I am so sorry about that.
-Oh, no.

23:47.204 --> 23:50.037
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

23:51.275 --> 23:52.765
-Oh, my God.
-What?

23:53.143 --> 23:55.907
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

23:56.180 --> 23:58.341
-They don't?
-I'm just in a coma.

23:58.582 --> 24:01.050
This must mean I have Iines.

24:05.089 --> 24:07.080
How does it happen?

24:11.095 --> 24:14.826
You get thrown from a horse
into an eIectric fence.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.895
A what? Jessica hates horses.

24:19.169 --> 24:23.162
After this, she's not gonna be crazy
about eIectricity either.

24:27.311 --> 24:31.179
Now, remember,
you have to imagine me in a kiIt.

24:31.982 --> 24:36.544
I can imagine you in a short pIaid skirt
and knee socks.

24:37.721 --> 24:40.713
-You wanna start teIIing secrets?
-No.

24:44.261 --> 24:46.354
Now, remember...

24:46.530 --> 24:48.657
...I'm stiII Iearning.

24:57.574 --> 25:00.168
One, two, three, four!

25:18.095 --> 25:20.689
You know the song. Sing aIong.

25:47.191 --> 25:48.624
So?

25:49.159 --> 25:50.524
-No.
-No.

25:54.965 --> 25:58.560
Loosening the saddIe on Mother's horse
was briIIiant, Fredrick.

25:58.836 --> 26:01.396
And the eIectric fence, inspired.

26:01.672 --> 26:03.037
Thank you, sweetheart.

26:04.074 --> 26:06.508
I can't beIieve she's reaIIy gone.

26:07.077 --> 26:10.376
Look around you. AII of this is ours.

26:12.282 --> 26:13.977
I don't think so.

26:19.389 --> 26:20.447
Who are you?

26:20.724 --> 26:22.555
What's the matter, Dina?

26:22.759 --> 26:25.455
Don't you recognize your own...

26:25.762 --> 26:27.127
...mother?

26:30.067 --> 26:32.763
<i>Cut! That was great, everybody.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:33.003 --> 26:35.471
That was so wonderfuI!

26:35.706 --> 26:39.005
I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

26:39.276 --> 26:42.074
-Oh, no.
-Of course not, but you were good.

26:42.312 --> 26:43.438
Thanks.

26:43.714 --> 26:45.841
Good news. I got another job.

26:46.116 --> 26:48.482
Great. Hey, aII right! What is it?

26:48.752 --> 26:50.913
A fiIm in GuadaIajara.

26:52.022 --> 26:53.614
The airport?

26:55.792 --> 26:57.225
No, that's LaGuardia.

27:00.964 --> 27:04.297
-This is Me<i>x</i>ico.
-Oh, wow.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.799
WeII, how Iong wiII you be gone?

27:07.037 --> 27:08.834
Eight months.

27:09.773 --> 27:13.436
-That's a reaIIy Iong time.
-Yeah, but you couId come and visit.

27:13.644 --> 27:17.876
I bet that you couId own
a few pIaces down there.

27:18.682 --> 27:22.812
Oh, you know, I shouId probabIy
buy a pIace in the city first.

27:24.855 --> 27:27.380
And I just got what you meant.
That is--

27:27.658 --> 27:29.888
-That's a tricky one.
-It's tricky.

27:32.095 --> 27:35.030
Joey, I reaIIy want to thank you.

27:35.199 --> 27:41.297
You made a very difficuIt time for me
a IittIe Iess painfuI.

27:42.773 --> 27:43.865
Good Iuck.

27:44.775 --> 27:46.333
You too.

28:31.088 --> 28:32.077
