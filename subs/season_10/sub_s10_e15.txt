00:00.367 --> 00:01.563
Previously on Friends:

00:01.729 --> 00:04.644
- How did the job stuff go?
- He offered me one!

00:04.812 --> 00:08.889
You know what? This calls
for a bottle of Israel's finest!

00:10.177 --> 00:12.295
The job is in Paris.

00:17.865 --> 00:20.301
Oh, God, please,
somebody say something.

00:20.868 --> 00:24.261
So if you take this job,
you'll be moving to Paris?

00:24.431 --> 00:27.187
Or facing a bitch of a commute.

00:28.596 --> 00:33.834
I know, it's huge, and it's scary
and it's really far away from you guys.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.392
But this is such
an incredible opportunity for me.

00:36.564 --> 00:39.080
I've already told them about
our situation with Emma...

00:39.246 --> 00:43.368
...and they said they'll do whatever
we need to make us feel comfortable.

00:43.531 --> 00:47.049
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
they'll fly you out. Anything we want.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.129
My boss said I might be getting
a new lamp in my cubicle.

00:56.223 --> 01:00.858
- All right. We'll work it out.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:02.189 --> 01:06.425
- You sure this is what you want?
- I think it is.

01:09.637 --> 01:13.793
- What's going on?
- I got a really incredible job offer.

01:13.961 --> 01:15.999
- Hey, great! All right!
- Good for you!

01:16.163 --> 01:17.996
- It's in Paris.
- What?

01:18.165 --> 01:23.848
No, no, no! No, no, no!
No, too much is changing, okay?

01:24.011 --> 01:26.608
First Phoebe getting married.
Congratulations.

01:26.774 --> 01:30.896
And then these two move in
to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

01:31.058 --> 01:35.739
- Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.
- It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!

01:37.064 --> 01:39.535
You guys, this is really, really
important to me.

01:39.707 --> 01:42.018
It means a lot if you could try
to get onboard.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.663
- Of course we can. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:45.913 --> 01:47.233
Joey?

01:47.394 --> 01:51.551
No, my hugs are reserved
for people staying in America!

01:51.719 --> 01:52.914
Joey, it would mean...

01:53.080 --> 01:56.075
No! Get your France-going arms
away from me!

01:57.965 --> 02:01.040
- Are you okay with this?
- Well, it makes me feel sad, but...

02:01.208 --> 02:03.280
- Talking to Ross.
- I see.

02:05.212 --> 02:08.891
Rachel moving to another country?
Not being able to see her every day?

02:09.056 --> 02:11.014
How could I be okay with this?

02:11.178 --> 02:13.536
But what are we gonna do?
She really needs this job.

02:13.701 --> 02:19.224
Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her
her old job back, she would take it?

02:19.386 --> 02:20.422
How's that gonna happen?

02:20.588 --> 02:23.981
Is this the best way to use
one of your three magic wishes?

02:24.151 --> 02:27.066
Like, I don't know,
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.468
I met him at that Christmas party.
I mean, we really hit it off.

02:30.638 --> 02:34.920
- The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?
- I didn't say we were brothers!

03:12.239 --> 03:14.881
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, tell me what you think.

03:15.042 --> 03:18.435
The house next door to the one that
we're buying just went on the market.

03:18.606 --> 03:20.803
I wanna take a look at it,
but Chandler doesn't.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.084
We close escrow tomorrow.

03:22.249 --> 03:25.164
Seeing another house can only
confuse us. We're easily confused.

03:25.332 --> 03:27.404
We're not very bright.

03:28.095 --> 03:30.771
But what if it's better than ours?
Shouldn't we look?

03:30.938 --> 03:32.258
What do you think, Pheebs?

03:32.419 --> 03:37.339
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like
you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

03:40.027 --> 03:41.781
Anyway...

03:43.511 --> 03:46.745
- Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
- Yeah.

03:46.914 --> 03:48.473
- She died.
- You're kidding!

03:48.636 --> 03:50.993
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, last Saturday.

03:51.158 --> 03:56.557
Wow! She was the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic!

03:58.125 --> 04:01.484
- Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
- Oh, yeah?

04:01.849 --> 04:05.812
- Yeah, she was just an agent.
- Joey's gonna be so upset.

04:05.973 --> 04:10.414
I know. He always wanted to be the
first black man to cross the Atlantic.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.178
We cannot tell Joey about this.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.857
He's already flipping out
about everything changing.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.777
This'll push him over the edge.

04:17.945 --> 04:20.415
- You don't think we should tell him?
- Not for a while.

04:20.588 --> 04:23.468
Let's just give him a few days
to get used to everything else.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.031
What if he reads the paper?

04:25.192 --> 04:28.825
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
I think we're okay.

04:34.802 --> 04:38.115
- May I help you?
- Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.

04:38.285 --> 04:41.405
Actually, we met at the Christmas party
about two years ago.

04:41.569 --> 04:45.532
- Oh, right. Don?
- Close. Ron.

04:47.134 --> 04:49.013
Well, what can I do for you?

04:49.176 --> 04:53.732
Well, I'm here to see
if you'll give Rachel her job back.

04:54.141 --> 04:56.863
Did she ask you to come here
and do this?

04:57.024 --> 04:58.618
First I have to get you to agree...

04:58.786 --> 05:01.461
...then we'll see
if she wants to come back.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.307
Wow, that is tempting.

05:04.912 --> 05:09.467
She loved her job here. Let's face it,
you're not gonna find anyone...

05:09.637 --> 05:12.028
...who did it as well as she did.
Isn't that true?

05:12.479 --> 05:16.032
- She is good.
- I took a shot there.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.841
But I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.605
Oh, that's not true.
There's nothing I want to do.

05:23.571 --> 05:25.130
I see.

05:25.853 --> 05:28.085
Thanks very much.

05:32.259 --> 05:34.981
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, his name is Ross.

05:39.426 --> 05:44.346
- What?
- Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.705
Does little Ross like dinosaurs,
by any chance?

05:49.877 --> 05:52.758
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

05:53.280 --> 05:57.915
How would he like to come with me
to the Museum of Natural History...

05:58.085 --> 06:01.638
...after everyone else has left,
just the two of us...

06:01.809 --> 06:04.531
...and he can touch anything he wants?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.971
I just heard it how you must
have heard it, and that's not good.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.417
Let me start again.
I'm a paleontologist.

06:15.583 --> 06:21.299
You'll be there with us, and the
touching refers only to bones... fossils!

06:24.311 --> 06:28.707
- You could really arrange that?
- You let Rachel come back and it's done.

06:28.876 --> 06:32.509
I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.276
Yes! Thank you! This is great!
Thank you so much.

06:35.442 --> 06:37.913
I swear, your kid's gonna have
the time of his life.

06:38.085 --> 06:39.998
That's great.
I worry about little Ross.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.561
He's always reading, collecting rocks
and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

06:43.731 --> 06:45.404
He'll be fine!

06:47.414 --> 06:48.484
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

06:48.656 --> 06:52.493
- Everything okay?
- I'm just mad at my agent.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.174
Estelle? Why?

06:54.341 --> 06:57.381
There's a part in this TV movie
that I would be perfect for...

06:57.545 --> 07:01.508
...and I didn't even get put up for it.
She better have a good reason.

07:02.309 --> 07:04.142
I'm guessing she does.

07:04.311 --> 07:07.864
Well, I wanna hear it,
because she keeps doing this.

07:08.035 --> 07:10.950
No, wait, wait, wait!
All right, I gotta go.

07:11.118 --> 07:15.274
Just listen. Promise me that you will
wait a minute before you call her.

07:15.442 --> 07:17.116
Well, okay. Why?

07:17.284 --> 07:22.922
Because a promise between friends
means never having to give a reason.

07:26.694 --> 07:29.290
I love that saying!

07:36.704 --> 07:40.222
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

07:40.988 --> 07:43.379
I was just gonna call you.
That's weird.

07:43.591 --> 07:47.109
It's a little coincidental,
but believable.

07:48.756 --> 07:51.831
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
why I didn't get you...

07:51.999 --> 07:54.196
...an audition for that TV movie.

07:54.361 --> 07:55.637
Yeah, actually I am.

07:55.803 --> 07:58.639
I guess I dropped the ball there.

08:00.007 --> 08:04.243
That's it? You know, it seems like
all you do lately is drop the ball.

08:04.411 --> 08:07.292
Don't take that tone with me.
Who do you think you are?

08:07.454 --> 08:12.534
Alan Lemon, the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.619
No, look, all I'm saying is
you're my agent...

08:16.784 --> 08:19.699
...and you're not getting me
any auditions and I'm tired of it.

08:19.867 --> 08:20.937
What are you saying?

08:21.108 --> 08:24.741
I'm saying that this isn't working
for me anymore, okay, Estelle?

08:24.912 --> 08:26.586
You're fired. Goodbye.

08:29.356 --> 08:32.431
Man, tough week for Estelle.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.636
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:36.804 --> 08:39.161
Emma left her stuffed T. Rex
at my house.

08:39.326 --> 08:43.927
- You know she can't sleep without it.
- Well, she's asleep now.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.211
- Stop forcing that thing on her.
- Okay.

08:47.414 --> 08:49.931
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today!

08:50.097 --> 08:53.058
Ralph Lauren called
and gave me my job back!

08:53.220 --> 08:57.137
- No!
- I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.265
They fire me and then out of nowhere,
they just hire me back.

09:00.427 --> 09:03.263
I mean, that place must just be
falling apart without me!

09:03.430 --> 09:06.710
- So you're not going to Paris?
- No, I'm still going!

09:10.758 --> 09:12.351
What?

09:12.520 --> 09:15.400
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people
found out...

09:15.563 --> 09:19.002
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
they offered me more money!

09:19.166 --> 09:21.558
Ross, isn't that great?

09:30.217 --> 09:34.579
Hi. We're buying the house next door.
Could we just take a look around?

09:34.742 --> 09:38.420
Sure, I'm showing it to someone else
right now, but please, look around.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.023
I feel like we're cheating
on our house.

09:41.468 --> 09:44.190
If we cheat, shouldn't it be
with a hot, younger house...

09:44.351 --> 09:46.822
...that does stuff
that our house won't do?

09:48.876 --> 09:51.518
Ours is so much better!

09:51.679 --> 09:55.391
This living room is smaller,
the dining room looks like a cave.

09:55.563 --> 09:56.838
What a hole!

09:57.004 --> 10:00.317
- So, what do you think?
- Love it!

10:00.848 --> 10:04.446
We already have one offer. I think
the lady upstairs will make another one.

10:04.612 --> 10:06.490
They could be our neighbors.
What are they like?

10:06.654 --> 10:09.694
The woman upstairs is nice.
She and her husband have two kids.

10:09.857 --> 10:15.255
- He's on Wall Street, and she's a...
- Oh... my... God!

10:24.592 --> 10:26.106
Sure.

10:31.358 --> 10:33.511
Hey, Joey, you wanna
come with me to...?

10:34.081 --> 10:35.276
Are you okay?

10:35.442 --> 10:38.482
Yeah, I just feel bad
about firing Estelle.

10:38.646 --> 10:40.957
This has gotta be killing her.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.088
No, that wouldn't kill her.

10:46.253 --> 10:48.531
A coronary embolism might.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.408
I don't know. She's gotta be
taking it hard. I was her only client.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.618
Except for this guy who eats paper.

10:54.782 --> 10:57.663
And I'm guessing he eats more money
than he makes.

10:58.145 --> 11:02.621
Look, I know she's not a great agent,
but she did stick with me for 10 years.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.783
- I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
- No, no, no! Don't call her.

11:06.954 --> 11:10.507
- You wait for her to call you.
- Why?

11:10.918 --> 11:15.359
Because patience is the road
to understanding.

11:16.684 --> 11:20.077
Which is the key to a happy heart.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.686
You blow me away.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.733
All right, so promise you're
gonna wait for her to call you?

11:27.895 --> 11:29.045
- I promise.
- Okay.

11:29.216 --> 11:33.293
And that means never having
to give a reason.

11:36.584 --> 11:39.100
What a small world!

11:39.266 --> 11:42.261
And yet I never run into Beyonce.

11:43.991 --> 11:45.311
You two know each other?

11:45.472 --> 11:48.627
We go way back. Before Monica
made an honest man out of him...

11:48.796 --> 11:52.679
...Chandler used to be
my little love muffin.

11:53.841 --> 11:56.881
So are you guys thinking
of getting this house too?

11:57.044 --> 12:01.645
Are we gonna have a bidding war?
I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

12:02.650 --> 12:05.007
No, actually, we are buying
the house next door.

12:05.813 --> 12:07.406
Why?

12:09.977 --> 12:11.890
I don't know why.

12:12.059 --> 12:15.452
Oh, that decides it, then!
I was on the fence.

12:15.623 --> 12:18.139
But knowing that you two
would be our neighbors?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.423
Now we have to get it!

12:20.588 --> 12:23.788
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

12:27.354 --> 12:29.472
This cannot be happening.

12:29.637 --> 12:32.028
The realtor said another couple
made an offer.

12:32.199 --> 12:36.641
Maybe the Janices won't get it!
Maybe the other couple will.

12:36.804 --> 12:41.086
The only way that'll happen is
if the other couple are the Hitlers!

12:43.731 --> 12:46.532
Okay, okay! All right,
what if we get both houses?

12:46.694 --> 12:49.769
- We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
- That's a great idea!

12:49.937 --> 12:52.248
By the way,
I don't mean to sound distasteful...

12:52.419 --> 12:55.255
...but when did you start
crapping money?

12:55.903 --> 12:57.861
- You come up with an idea.
- All right.

12:58.025 --> 13:01.259
We've still got three hours
till escrow closes on our house.

13:01.428 --> 13:03.581
- We can still get out.
- But we love our house.

13:03.751 --> 13:05.664
Will we love it so much
with her next door?

13:05.833 --> 13:07.826
And she's gonna be louder
out here too!

13:07.995 --> 13:11.308
Just the crickets
and, "Oh... my... God!"

13:12.079 --> 13:15.678
Okay. But if we don't get this house,
she'll still show up wherever we go.

13:15.843 --> 13:18.804
At least if she's here,
it eliminates the element of surprise.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.357
Never again will you have to hear
the three words...

13:21.529 --> 13:24.489
...that make your balls jump back up
inside your body!

13:29.937 --> 13:34.332
Well, we have to do something.
We can't have her living next door.

13:37.424 --> 13:39.577
Oh, that does it too.

13:46.313 --> 13:47.543
Who is it?

13:47.715 --> 13:49.229
It's me. Ron.

13:51.478 --> 13:53.517
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

13:53.681 --> 13:57.438
...but I think there's a way you might
be able to get her to come back.

13:57.605 --> 14:03.607
This may surprise you, but rehiring
fired employees is not my main job.

14:03.971 --> 14:05.405
Just hear me out.

14:05.573 --> 14:09.695
How would you feel
about offering her a raise?

14:13.901 --> 14:15.655
Not good, Ron.

14:16.664 --> 14:18.896
Perhaps I can persuade you.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.629
What if you could give your son...

14:21.789 --> 14:27.346
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

14:33.801 --> 14:36.271
Wow! That's pretty cool.

14:37.164 --> 14:39.840
So? Do we have a deal?

14:40.407 --> 14:43.447
- Okay, you got it.
- Yes! Yes!

14:43.611 --> 14:46.572
This is gonna make me very popular.

14:46.734 --> 14:49.729
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.492
I meant with my son.

14:56.023 --> 14:58.699
Good, because the ladies,
not so much.

15:05.833 --> 15:10.912
Joey, this is Al Zebooker,
the guy who eats paper.

15:11.358 --> 15:14.239
I'm sure you've heard
that Estelle passed away.

15:14.401 --> 15:16.918
I wanted to let you know
there's a memorial for her...

15:17.084 --> 15:20.477
...at the Westside Chapel
tomorrow at 10.

15:20.648 --> 15:22.401
Hope you can make it.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.243
Oh, my God.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.540
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

15:41.789 --> 15:43.269
Estelle?

15:43.430 --> 15:48.590
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that
there's no hard feelings for firing me.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.920
Okay. I just...
I can't believe you're calling me.

15:57.084 --> 15:59.042
I didn't think I should just drop by.

15:59.206 --> 16:01.962
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

16:03.531 --> 16:07.608
Anyway, you did what you had to do.
I'm okay.

16:07.815 --> 16:10.047
Can I ask you something?

16:11.098 --> 16:12.498
What's it like there?

16:13.741 --> 16:15.141
It's all right.

16:16.263 --> 16:18.176
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.420
Good luck with the career.
You're gonna be huge!

16:21.589 --> 16:25.107
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.069
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!

16:33.961 --> 16:37.434
Well, I just talked to Sid.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.167
We are definitely putting in
an offer on the house.

16:40.327 --> 16:42.206
And I'll bet we get it!

16:42.369 --> 16:45.091
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

16:46.133 --> 16:50.369
All right, I gotta run.
Tell Monica I say goodbye.

16:50.538 --> 16:53.134
I'll see you later, neighbor.

16:53.581 --> 16:55.095
Wait!

16:55.863 --> 17:00.065
I just want you to know that
I'm so happy you're going to be here.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.265
Oh, me too!

17:02.429 --> 17:04.103
Because...

17:04.271 --> 17:06.070
...that way...

17:06.273 --> 17:09.393
...we can pick up where we left off.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.873
I never stopped loving you.

17:16.043 --> 17:18.799
- Oh... my...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:21.168 --> 17:23.320
I want you.

17:23.490 --> 17:25.130
I need you.

17:25.292 --> 17:30.087
I must have you,
Janice Litman-Goralnik nee Hosenstein.

17:32.780 --> 17:36.173
Chandler, what are you talking about?

17:37.064 --> 17:40.025
Now that you live next door,
we can be together every day.

17:40.187 --> 17:42.579
Sid and Monica never have
to know a thing.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.107
I don't know what to say.

17:45.472 --> 17:51.668
I mean, you know, obviously
we have this heat between us.

17:56.524 --> 17:58.356
Obviously.

17:59.086 --> 18:01.557
But I love my husband.

18:01.729 --> 18:04.006
And I know you love your wife.

18:04.171 --> 18:06.847
I don't think we should get
this house now.

18:07.014 --> 18:10.054
Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream
and take it away.

18:11.338 --> 18:14.618
Chandler, one of us
has got to be strong.

18:15.022 --> 18:16.901
I understand.

18:18.425 --> 18:20.019
Although...

18:20.628 --> 18:23.782
Maybe just one last moment
of weakness.

18:36.163 --> 18:38.919
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.812
They're never coming down now!

18:49.176 --> 18:50.212
- Hi.
- Hi!

18:50.377 --> 18:53.896
You are never going to believe
what happened to me today.

18:54.061 --> 18:55.051
What?

18:55.222 --> 18:58.821
Ralph Lauren called, again,
and they offered me more money.

18:58.986 --> 19:03.302
- They did?
- Yes! It was the weirdest thing.

19:03.470 --> 19:07.023
Zelner called me and said, "We will
do anything we can to get you back."

19:07.194 --> 19:09.631
And that I should thank some "Ron."

19:09.797 --> 19:12.837
I don't even know
what department that guy's in!

19:13.561 --> 19:16.601
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Well, I took it!

19:16.764 --> 19:20.123
That's great!
So you're staying in New York!

19:24.091 --> 19:28.726
- You're excited, right?
- You know... Look, the money's great.

19:28.896 --> 19:32.016
- It's certainly the easier choice.
- Right.

19:32.179 --> 19:36.461
But, you know, I mean, was I looking
forward to going to Paris? Sure.

19:36.624 --> 19:40.381
Was I excited about working
in the fashion capital of the world?

19:40.548 --> 19:42.062
Oh, absolutely.

19:46.473 --> 19:48.785
Yeah, but you know, this is...

19:48.956 --> 19:53.557
It's fine. I'm fine going back
to a job where I've pretty much...

19:53.721 --> 19:57.080
...gotten everything out of it
that I possibly can.

20:00.648 --> 20:02.446
I had really... I had no idea...

20:04.171 --> 20:09.091
I had no idea you were
so excited about Paris.

20:10.097 --> 20:12.135
I mean, you said you were scared.

20:12.299 --> 20:14.975
I mean, it was "good" scared, though,
you know?

20:15.142 --> 20:17.818
I mean, like "when I moved
to New York" scared.

20:17.985 --> 20:22.666
Or "when I found out I was
gonna have Emma" scared.

20:25.152 --> 20:28.705
But this is fine.
This is gonna be good.

20:34.722 --> 20:36.521
You should go.

20:37.525 --> 20:39.005
What?

20:40.808 --> 20:43.483
It's what you want. You should go.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.045
You really think so?

20:47.094 --> 20:48.814
I really do.

20:50.297 --> 20:53.292
But I already told Zelner
that I would come back.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.579
I'm sure he'll understand.

21:01.068 --> 21:06.101
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna go to Paris!

21:08.916 --> 21:11.193
I'm going to Paris!

21:11.358 --> 21:13.875
- Thank you, Ross.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:17.044 --> 21:19.321
Oh, I'm so happy.

21:20.568 --> 21:22.526
Then I'm happy too.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.018
Thank you all for coming.

21:35.182 --> 21:38.861
We're here today to pay our respects
to a wonderful agent...

21:39.026 --> 21:40.984
...and a beautiful woman.

21:42.189 --> 21:43.863
Inside.

21:46.233 --> 21:51.073
As Estelle's only two clients,
we would like to say a few words.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.311
Dude, where's my speech?

21:59.647 --> 22:03.245
That is entertaining.
Al Zebooker, everybody!

22:07.334 --> 22:09.327
