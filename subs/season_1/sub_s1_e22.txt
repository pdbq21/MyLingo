00:01.034 --> 00:02.763
-Tell him.
-Tell him.

00:02.969 --> 00:05.130
-Shut up.
-Tell me what?

00:05.372 --> 00:06.771
You won't look at him.

00:06.973 --> 00:10.875
I could use another
reason why women won't look at me.

00:11.144 --> 00:15.604
All right. All right.
Last night, I had a dream...

00:15.882 --> 00:18.248
...that you and I were

00:18.451 --> 00:21.249
Doing it on this table.

00:22.555 --> 00:25.285
Excellent dream score.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.930
Why would you dream that?

00:32.465 --> 00:33.830
More importantly...

00:34.067 --> 00:35.329
...was I any good?

00:36.770 --> 00:39.432
Well, you were pretty damn good.

00:39.773 --> 00:44.233
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

00:45.278 --> 00:49.374
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.650
I love it when we share.

00:58.658 --> 00:59.818
You okay?

01:00.026 --> 01:03.484
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.731
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.

01:05.932 --> 01:10.369
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.168
The One With The lck Factor

01:59.385 --> 02:00.613
Hello, Rachel.

02:01.254 --> 02:02.653
Get off.

02:05.325 --> 02:09.659
Ooh, give me. Can you see me
operating a drill press?

02:10.029 --> 02:12.657
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

02:15.835 --> 02:18.497
Why would you want to?

02:18.705 --> 02:22.664
For short-term work. Till I get
back my massage clients.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.468
Pirates again?

02:25.111 --> 02:27.545
No. Nothing like that.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.941
I'm just such a dummy.

02:30.183 --> 02:35.314
I taught a "Massage Yourself at Home"
workshop. And they are.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.920
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.627
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.828
I could. I could do it. What is it?

02:45.064 --> 02:50.229
My secretary's gonna be out.
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

02:50.537 --> 02:53.165
It's a whole big boob story.

02:53.373 --> 02:57.833
-I could be a secretary.
-I don't know if it'd be your thing...

02:58.044 --> 03:02.947
... because it involves being
normal for a large portion of the day.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.078
I could do that.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.780
-What's that?
-My new beeper.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.456
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

03:11.691 --> 03:16.788
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?
Help. They're still extinct.

03:17.297 --> 03:20.755
It's for when Carol goes into labor.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.629
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.

03:25.471 --> 03:28.929
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.804
-See you later.
-Off to see young Ethan?

03:32.278 --> 03:33.677
Thank you.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.175
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

03:38.151 --> 03:40.346
He's our age.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.178
When we were....

03:45.959 --> 03:49.019
-He's a senior in college.
-College?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.663
Rob that cradle.

03:52.632 --> 03:56.261
He's smart and mature and grown-up.

03:56.469 --> 04:00.872
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.471
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

04:04.911 --> 04:08.039
No, of course not.
It's not even an issue...

04:08.314 --> 04:09.975
... because I said I was 22.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.480
-You what?
-What?

04:11.684 --> 04:15.176
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-Well, maybe 25, 26.

04:15.488 --> 04:18.150
-I am 26.
-There you go.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.767
Can you hear that?

04:36.609 --> 04:40.067
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.948
-Oh, I'm on.
-Okay.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.781
Mr. Bing's office.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.849
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-I'm not in a meeting.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.823
Will he know what
this is in reference to?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.622
And he has your number?

04:58.865 --> 05:02.528
I'll see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.072
Ross says hi.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.302
This is so fun.
What do we do now?

05:10.510 --> 05:13.343
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.240
"Most likely."

05:19.252 --> 05:21.413
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.588
All right. Bye-bye.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.256
Bye-bye.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.797
-Yes?
-What you doing?

05:37.003 --> 05:40.404
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.938
BeIt's too tight.
Gotta change.

05:43.142 --> 05:47.306
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.146
-Am I out of control?
-Just a touch.

05:51.718 --> 05:55.484
I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since...

05:55.688 --> 05:57.781
... his midterms.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.953
Why, all of a sudden,
are you so...?

06:04.864 --> 06:09.494
-What?
-Could tonight be the night?

06:11.070 --> 06:14.005
I don't know. He's a great guy...

06:14.240 --> 06:17.505
...and I love being with him.
But, you know...

06:17.910 --> 06:22.347
...things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

06:23.182 --> 06:25.912
-So, did you shave your legs?
-Yeah.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.981
Would you let it go?
It was just a dream.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.682
It doesn't mean

06:36.763 --> 06:39.027
This is it. It's baby time!

06:39.298 --> 06:41.823
All right, relax. Just relax.
Be cool.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.867
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

06:47.640 --> 06:52.134
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.204
Yes, I am sure.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.782
I do not perform
those kind of services.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.475
Services?

07:00.720 --> 07:01.880
Oh, services.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.716
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.162
That's right.

07:11.364 --> 07:14.390
That's right.
JUMBO with a "U," sir.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.124
You don't want me.

07:16.402 --> 07:20.304
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.933
Alrighty, bye-bye.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.577
How was the first day?

07:28.815 --> 07:32.148
Excellent.
Everyone was so, so nice.

07:32.351 --> 07:36.185
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.754
Me.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.816
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.825
Well, because, you know.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.322
They don't like you.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.162
-What?
-I thought you knew.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.234
-Who doesn't like me?
-Everyone.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.103
Except for....

08:00.413 --> 08:01.937
No. Everyone.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.776
-What are you talking about?
-Don't feel bad.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.250
They used to like you a lot.

08:10.456 --> 08:15.223
But you got promoted, and now you're
Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.055
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

08:19.699 --> 08:23.135
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah. They even do you.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.672
They "do" me?

08:26.906 --> 08:28.533
You know, like, okay:

08:29.375 --> 08:31.707
"Could that report be any later?"

08:37.416 --> 08:40.214
-I don't sound like that.
-Yeah, you do.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.888
"The hills are alive
with the sound...

08:45.358 --> 08:47.189
...of music."

08:52.698 --> 08:55.690
"My scone. My scone."

08:57.837 --> 09:01.238
I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.344
That is so not
That is so not

09:05.611 --> 09:07.670
That
Oh, shut up.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.978
-Did not.
-Up until I was 9...

09:14.287 --> 09:17.745
... I thought "gunpoint" was
a place where crimes happened.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.983
-How's that possible?
-It's always on the news.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.787
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

09:23.996 --> 09:26.294
"Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint."

09:26.799 --> 09:31.236
And I kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

09:35.641 --> 09:37.871
I should go.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.643
-Unless
-What?

09:49.855 --> 09:51.982
Unless you wanna stay over.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.852
I mean, I'm going to. So....

09:56.696 --> 09:58.823
Yeah, I'd really like that.

10:06.105 --> 10:10.371
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff...

10:10.610 --> 10:13.078
...there's something you should know.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.544
Is this, like,
"I have an early class tomorrow"...

10:16.782 --> 10:19.410
...or "I'm secretly married
to a goat"?

10:19.952 --> 10:23.547
Well, it's somewhere in between.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.954
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not....

10:28.194 --> 10:31.061
Well, I mean, I haven't ever....

10:31.263 --> 10:32.594
Ethan?

10:33.232 --> 10:34.563
Are you a virgin?

10:34.934 --> 10:39.030
If that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then...

10:39.305 --> 10:41.500
...yes, I am.

10:43.476 --> 10:48.175
I mean, you're just such a good kisser
I would never have known.

10:48.381 --> 10:53.114
Well, I've excelled at every level
I've been to, I just....

10:55.254 --> 10:59.190
I just haven't been to
that particular one yet.

10:59.392 --> 11:03.954
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.688
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.327
You do know I was talking
about you, right?

11:19.245 --> 11:20.644
Wow.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.304
You keep saying that.

11:23.916 --> 11:27.352
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

11:27.586 --> 11:31.181
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

11:31.590 --> 11:34.150
...it is nothing like that.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.591
Listen, listen.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.932
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

11:45.137 --> 11:49.267
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.807
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.106
Nothing wrong about that.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.051
Here goes.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.456
I'm not 22.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.357
I'm 25...

12:09.662 --> 12:10.993
...and 1 3 months.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.594
But I figure that shouldn't
change anything.

12:17.803 --> 12:22.740
What does it matter how old we are?
Basically, I'm nuts about you.

12:22.942 --> 12:27.879
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.140
I just thought
you were naturally minty.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.949
Listen...

12:36.655 --> 12:39.818
...as long as we're
telling stuff...

12:40.826 --> 12:42.953
... I have another one for you.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.927
I'm a little younger than I said.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.762
-You're not a senior?
-Oh, I'm a senior...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.800
...in high school.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.419
What we did was wrong.

13:10.623 --> 13:15.822
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.355
I just had sex.

13:22.735 --> 13:26.068
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

13:26.272 --> 13:28.900
-You never said your age.
-It's different.

13:29.108 --> 13:33.340
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.074
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling

13:37.283 --> 13:40.650
-Don't say it.
-ln love with you.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.454
-Really?
-Sorry.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.614
Well, fall out of it.

13:46.859 --> 13:50.351
You shouldn't be here.
It's a school night.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.129
Oh, God.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.630
I'm like those women
that you see...

13:56.869 --> 13:59.303
...with shiny guys named Chad.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.738
I'm Joan Collins.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.136
Who?

14:17.223 --> 14:20.556
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

14:23.562 --> 14:27.464
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.192
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.404
It's just easier that way.

14:36.308 --> 14:40.472
-You told me about the last dream.
-No. Forget it.

14:40.679 --> 14:44.638
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.286
All right. Fine.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.014
You were not the only one there.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.683
Joey was there too.

14:57.329 --> 14:58.762
All right.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.590
Was there...

15:05.304 --> 15:07.602
...anybody else there?

15:09.275 --> 15:11.266
You sure? Nobody...

15:11.477 --> 15:14.139
... handing out mints or anything?

15:16.115 --> 15:18.913
No, it was just the three of us.

15:20.786 --> 15:22.515
So was it you and Chandler...

15:22.788 --> 15:26.224
...then you and me,
or you, me and Chandler?

15:27.559 --> 15:29.686
-You know what?
-What?

15:30.529 --> 15:32.360
There were times...

15:32.631 --> 15:34.861
...when it wasn't even me.

15:44.476 --> 15:47.843
That is so sweet, you guys.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.179
Mon, Ethan called again.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.027
-What?
-Ethan called again.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.524
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.099
Sometimes, things don't work out.

16:12.438 --> 16:17.705
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

16:20.679 --> 16:23.705
I did not say anything. I swear.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.816
-He stopped by.
-Next time you talk to him...

16:27.019 --> 16:31.183
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

16:33.192 --> 16:36.958
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

16:37.196 --> 16:38.390
Sorry.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.497
"It's morphin'time."

16:40.699 --> 16:43.566
-Stegosaurus.
-Tyrannosaurus.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.305
I gotta go.

16:49.641 --> 16:50.972
Head rush.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.841
One more, and then I have to go.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.378
Cool.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.614
Where you going?

17:02.821 --> 17:05.449
A birthday party
with some work people.

17:05.657 --> 17:09.320
Work people? Nobody told me.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.825
I know.
That's part of the whole...

17:12.097 --> 17:15.294
...them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.694
A month ago,
these people were my friends.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.964
I'm in charge,
but I'm not a different person.

17:23.308 --> 17:28.143
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.508
-You think I should?
-I really do.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.212
But could we not go together?

17:35.954 --> 17:39.515
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

17:43.462 --> 17:46.090
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

17:46.298 --> 17:50.928
-This can't be easy for him either.
-I know.

17:51.136 --> 17:55.266
This may take some time
for him to get over it...

17:55.474 --> 17:59.171
... but, then at four,
Muppet Babies is on.

18:06.051 --> 18:09.543
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.723
Sorry, Shelly.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.827
See, with the fun?

18:18.363 --> 18:19.853
Last night was great.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.796
The karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory."

18:24.036 --> 18:27.335
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

18:27.539 --> 18:30.235
-What?
-Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.033
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

18:32.244 --> 18:35.008
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy
Boss Man Bing.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.906
Then I don't get it.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.617
You know what?
I think you just gotta face it.

18:42.821 --> 18:45.255
You're the guy in the big office.

18:45.491 --> 18:48.358
You're the one that hires
and fires them.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.256
-They say you're a great boss.
-They do?

18:52.498 --> 18:54.966
But they're not
your friends anymore.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.930
-I just want
-But you can't.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.331
But I just want

19:10.115 --> 19:11.173
Are you gonna?

19:11.383 --> 19:15.149
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1...

19:15.354 --> 19:18.755
...she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.219
What about Andre?

19:20.425 --> 19:23.485
He got a call
from our cousin, Nathan.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.631
Frankly, it was a little more
than I needed to know.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.675
That was gonna be my opener.

19:38.076 --> 19:41.944
Have you guys seen those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

19:42.147 --> 19:45.446
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.317
Look, I gotta tell you something.

19:51.557 --> 19:55.357
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was vulnerable.

19:55.594 --> 20:00.031
I'm actually 30. I have a wife
and a job. I'm your congressman.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.028
This is ridiculous.
We're great together.

20:04.269 --> 20:08.171
We can talk, make each other
laugh, and the sex....

20:08.407 --> 20:12.309
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.480
-lt was.
-Then what's the problem?

20:17.015 --> 20:19.006
Ethan, it's....

20:21.119 --> 20:22.950
It's icky.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.719
"lcky"?

20:24.923 --> 20:29.485
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's "icky"?

20:29.695 --> 20:33.756
This isn't easy for me either.
I wish things were different.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.592
If you were older
or I was younger...

20:36.835 --> 20:40.293
...or we lived in biblical times...

20:40.505 --> 20:43.065
-... I could really
-No, don't say it.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.140
Love you.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.314
-Are your hands still wet?
-Moist.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.450
Let's dry them again.

20:59.291 --> 21:03.057
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

21:04.930 --> 21:06.090
Hey, Chandler.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.696
Hello, Mr. Bing.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.232
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

21:12.137 --> 21:17.268
Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm
gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.376
-Sure.
-No problem.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.507
You have to give them something.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.981
That was Gerston, Santos, and
who's the other guy?

21:28.186 --> 21:30.086
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.950
Well, some people
are gonna be working...

21:33.158 --> 21:35.524
...this weekend.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.282
Oh, that's nice.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.031
Ross.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.540
I'm here.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.712
You are?

22:34.086 --> 22:35.883
We were just....

22:37.723 --> 22:39.315
What?

22:41.960 --> 22:45.225
-Great. Now I'm having a baby.
-What?

22:46.631 --> 22:49.828
I'm having a baby. I'm having a

22:50.068 --> 22:53.162
-The phone, the phone.
-I don't have the phone.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.403
I'm hurt.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.781
Let's go.
Come on, people. Woman in labor.

23:06.284 --> 23:09.685
-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.787
We're going to a hospital.

23:12.991 --> 23:16.188
I can't look nice?
There are doctors there.

23:16.428 --> 23:19.556
-Joey, get out of the fridge.
-All right.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.300
-What is that?
-For the ride.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.196
-Like in a cab
-Save it.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.497
-Hating this.
-Monica, come on. Let's go.

23:27.706 --> 23:28.695
Baby coming.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.398
I can't believe I'm gonna be
an aunt.

23:31.676 --> 23:35.077
-I'll have a nephew.
-That's nice. Get out.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.881
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.118
Here we go. Come on.
