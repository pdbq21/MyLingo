WEBVTT

00:04.208 --> 00:06.679
Hey, hon? Would you help me
get the plates down?

00:06.847 --> 00:09.978
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't
we use our wedding china today?

00:10.722 --> 00:14.092
Or we could save them
for a fancy special occasion.

00:14.328 --> 00:17.597
How about this:
You could treat me like I'm an equal..

00:17.769 --> 00:21.469
or talk down to me
like I'm a child.

00:22.211 --> 00:25.946
No, I just think we should save our china
for something really special.

00:26.119 --> 00:28.453
Like if the queen of England
comes over.

00:29.025 --> 00:32.020
Honey, she keeps canceling on us.
Take the hint.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.194
What if something breaks?
They're expensive.

00:35.404 --> 00:38.433
What is the point of having them
if we never use them?

00:38.611 --> 00:41.583
Okay. But if something breaks
and then the queen comes over..

00:41.784 --> 00:45.416
- I will explain it to her.
- Like I'd let you talk to the queen.

00:47.328 --> 00:50.357
Wow, the parade is really good this year.

00:50.535 --> 00:53.335
Man, those horses can crap.

00:54.008 --> 00:56.502
Next up is a marching band
from Muskogee, Oklahoma.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.811
Muskogee?
That's like four hours from Tulsa!

01:01.991 --> 01:03.254
Y'all look great!

01:03.728 --> 01:05.219
That's right, I said "y'all!"

01:06.667 --> 01:09.571
Here's the float with the stars
of the popular daytime soap..

01:09.806 --> 01:11.935
Days of Our Lives.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.313
Oh, my God!

01:17.488 --> 01:21.360
Aren't you one of the stars of the
popular daytime soap Days of our Lives?

01:21.563 --> 01:24.535
I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!

01:25.838 --> 01:29.573
I can't believe I forgot! I usually write
stuff like this down on my arm!

01:32.519 --> 01:35.115
Stupid long sleeves!

01:36.527 --> 01:39.396
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll come up with a good reason..

01:39.566 --> 01:41.125
why I wasn't there.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.103
The producers are gonna be mad.
They sat us down and said:

01:44.275 --> 01:49.308
"Everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. sharp.
That means you, Tribbiani."

01:49.519 --> 01:52.319
Like I was some kind of idiot.

01:54.228 --> 01:56.391
Well, you proved them wrong.

02:44.629 --> 02:46.861
Oh, Emma.

02:47.034 --> 02:50.063
This is your first Thanksgiving.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.609
What are you thankful for?

02:52.779 --> 02:54.840
Mommy's boobies?

02:55.618 --> 02:58.316
A lot of people are thankful for those.

03:00.728 --> 03:02.664
Hello? Rachel?

03:02.866 --> 03:03.993
Who is it?

03:04.168 --> 03:07.231
It's your favorite sister.

03:07.407 --> 03:09.776
- Jill?
- Amy!

03:10.013 --> 03:11.880
Hide my rings.

03:16.793 --> 03:20.027
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.

03:24.876 --> 03:26.903
Do you have a hair straightener?

03:28.116 --> 03:30.177
Hi.

03:30.487 --> 03:31.786
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:31.957 --> 03:34.325
Hair straightener.

03:34.495 --> 03:38.903
- I haven't seen you in, like, a year.
- I know. I know. I've just been crazed.

03:39.104 --> 03:42.304
Well, me too. I had a baby.

03:42.946 --> 03:45.918
I decorated Dad's office.

03:46.085 --> 03:51.529
Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk
out of your vagina, not the same thing.

03:52.598 --> 03:55.194
About that hair straightener,
honey, I really need one.

03:55.370 --> 03:58.171
I'm gonna have dinner
at my boyfriend's house.

03:59.178 --> 04:01.273
Oh, my God.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.818
Is this Emmett?

04:07.494 --> 04:09.692
It's Emma.

04:09.899 --> 04:11.333
It's a girl?

04:13.272 --> 04:15.869
- Hey, Amy.
- Amy, you remember Ross?

04:17.047 --> 04:18.914
Not really.

04:19.084 --> 04:22.819
But you are much cuter
than that geeky guy she used to date.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.668
That was me.

04:28.169 --> 04:32.200
No, he was this creepy guy from high
school who had this huge crush on her..

04:32.411 --> 04:34.244
since, like, the ninth grade.

04:34.415 --> 04:35.850
Still me.

04:36.686 --> 04:38.348
No, I'm not talking about you.

04:38.524 --> 04:41.359
It was your fat friend's brother
with that bad Afro.

04:41.563 --> 04:45.560
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you
some time, okay? All me!

04:50.581 --> 04:53.781
Careful. Careful.

04:54.088 --> 04:55.955
Careful!

04:56.358 --> 04:58.659
I'll tell you what.
For the rest of our lives..

04:58.864 --> 05:01.266
I'll be careful until told otherwise.

05:03.439 --> 05:05.910
- This isn't the china we picked out.
- I know.

05:06.112 --> 05:09.482
After you left the store,
I chose different ones.

05:10.120 --> 05:14.117
- Why?
- Your taste is a little feminine for me.

05:14.328 --> 05:16.891
Suddenly flowers are feminine?

05:18.002 --> 05:20.940
Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

05:21.142 --> 05:23.476
- Happy Thanksgiving. Phoebe!
- What's going on, Joe?

05:23.647 --> 05:25.879
Listen, I need a good lie.

05:26.051 --> 05:27.451
Okay.

05:27.722 --> 05:31.719
How about the whole "man walking
on the moon" thing, you know?

05:32.497 --> 05:35.800
You can see the strings, people!

05:36.005 --> 05:39.843
No, no, no. I need a good lie to explain
why I wasn't at a work thing today.

05:40.313 --> 05:42.807
- Honey, you stink at lying.
- I do not.

05:43.019 --> 05:46.355
Really? Let me ask you something.
Yesterday at the coffeehouse..

05:46.526 --> 05:50.192
I went to the bathroom. When I came
back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?

05:51.670 --> 05:53.867
Somebody opened the door
to the coffeehouse..

05:54.041 --> 05:58.004
and a raccoon ran in and went
straight for your muffin. I said:

05:58.182 --> 06:01.484
"Hey, don't eat that!
That's Phoebe's!" And he said..

06:03.727 --> 06:07.531
He said, "Joey, you stink at lying."
What am I gonna do?

06:07.702 --> 06:10.400
Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
I'll help you.

06:10.608 --> 06:14.571
- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
- Sure. What was the work thing?

06:16.085 --> 06:19.148
- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."
- Oh, man!

06:22.430 --> 06:24.731
She's precious.

06:25.236 --> 06:28.971
Do you ever worry
that she's gonna get your real nose?

06:29.144 --> 06:31.080
Amy..

06:32.183 --> 06:34.586
Yes, I do. I really do.

06:38.997 --> 06:40.591
Hello?

06:40.768 --> 06:44.298
Yeah, hang on, one sec.
Can I take this upstairs?

06:44.474 --> 06:46.707
Sure. We don't live there, but..

06:47.715 --> 06:51.678
Seriously? It's just these rooms?

06:52.390 --> 06:56.228
- I thought you were a doctor.
- Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.

07:02.010 --> 07:05.346
God, she is unbelievable.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.648
I know. I mean, a Ph.D.
is just as good as an MD.

07:08.857 --> 07:10.588
Sure, Ross, yeah!

07:10.761 --> 07:15.202
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
I want you there with your fossil brush.

07:17.173 --> 07:19.234
- Stupid Thanksgiving.
- What?

07:19.411 --> 07:22.578
- What? What happened?
- My boyfriend canceled on me.

07:22.752 --> 07:25.245
I mean, I finally find a real relationship.

07:25.423 --> 07:30.388
Someone that I can spend this day with,
and then his wife comes back into town!

07:30.567 --> 07:33.801
I swear, it's almost not even
worth dating married guys.

07:34.274 --> 07:36.039
Don't say that.

07:37.447 --> 07:39.918
God, I was so looking forward to this.

07:40.086 --> 07:43.115
It was gonna be such
a beautiful Thanksgiving.

07:43.292 --> 07:45.729
We were gonna have sushi.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.598
Amy, don't cry.

07:50.774 --> 07:54.474
- Ross, can I talk to you in private?
- Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or..?

07:59.357 --> 08:02.352
Look, I was thinking,
if it's okay with Monica..

08:02.531 --> 08:05.127
I would like to invite Amy
to Thanksgiving.

08:05.470 --> 08:11.381
I think that's a great idea. It'll be like
the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.

08:12.751 --> 08:15.655
Look, I know she's a little tough to take.

08:15.824 --> 08:20.162
But she has nowhere else to go,
and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.

08:20.333 --> 08:25.332
- And I would like them to bond.
- I don't want them bonding too much.

08:25.511 --> 08:28.038
I don't want her telling Emma
she needs a nose job.

08:28.282 --> 08:32.222
Ross, she may need one. We're just
gonna have to make our peace with that!

08:39.137 --> 08:40.868
Amy..

08:41.543 --> 08:43.444
Amy?

08:44.982 --> 08:46.450
Amy!

08:46.619 --> 08:48.053
I'm out in the hall.

08:48.222 --> 08:52.994
Your baby had some sort of
explosion of stink.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.468
The bonding's going great.

09:02.518 --> 09:04.316
- Hi!
- Hey.

09:04.487 --> 09:07.688
Hey, you guys. This is my sister, Amy.

09:07.861 --> 09:11.961
This is Chandler, Joey,
Phoebe, and you know Mon.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.662
Oh, my God.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.037
You're on Days of Our Lives!

09:16.244 --> 09:17.611
Yeah.

09:17.781 --> 09:21.185
Wow! They must put
a lot of makeup on you.

09:23.359 --> 09:25.694
Happy Thanksgiving.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.565
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:30.907 --> 09:33.970
So welcome. Is this the first time
you're seeing Emma?

09:34.180 --> 09:37.311
Yeah, I think so.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.

09:39.525 --> 09:42.861
- Phoebe.
- That's a funny noise.

09:46.572 --> 09:50.409
- Phoebe? I still need some help here.
- Right. Okay.

09:50.580 --> 09:55.021
So it's not just the lie you tell,
but it's the way you tell it. For example..

09:55.189 --> 09:58.526
if you look at the ground when
you talk, people know you're lying.

09:59.364 --> 10:03.395
I don't know why this is so hard for me.
Lying is basically just acting..

10:03.573 --> 10:06.977
- and I am a terrific actor.
- You are a terrific actor.

10:08.048 --> 10:10.884
I could talk to the producers for you.
I'm a great liar.

10:11.054 --> 10:12.956
Take Monica's dress. I said I loved it.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.651
- I hate it.
- Hey!

10:14.829 --> 10:17.265
I'm also a great moron.

10:20.473 --> 10:23.605
- Hey. Where's the baby?
- We just put her down for a nap.

10:23.780 --> 10:27.480
Listen, I was just thinking.
You know what would be incredible?

10:27.654 --> 10:30.352
If you guys died!

10:31.662 --> 10:33.859
Thank you, Amy.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.903
No, no, then I would get the baby.

10:37.073 --> 10:41.411
It would be just like a movie. At first
I wouldn't know what to do with her.

10:41.582 --> 10:45.716
And then I would rise to the occasion.
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.

10:45.924 --> 10:48.258
That's a great movie!

10:49.799 --> 10:52.896
Now, listen, not that you guys
could stop me or anything..

10:53.105 --> 10:55.473
because you know, you'd be dead.

10:55.644 --> 10:57.944
But I was thinking about
changing her name.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.518
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.

11:02.156 --> 11:03.785
Emma.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.453
Emma? Ross wants you.

11:08.803 --> 11:10.864
Phoebe!

11:12.176 --> 11:15.171
Why does she keep making that noise?

11:17.754 --> 11:20.054
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this..

11:20.259 --> 11:24.564
but if something were to happen
to Ross or myself..

11:24.802 --> 11:28.036
- you wouldn't get the baby.
- Well, who would?

11:28.710 --> 11:32.342
Well, we haven't officially
asked them yet..

11:32.517 --> 11:34.510
but we would want
Monica and Chandler.

11:34.688 --> 11:36.885
- Who?
- You're in their apartment.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.430
I can't believe you'd want us
to raise Emma.

11:41.602 --> 11:43.538
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.

11:43.740 --> 11:46.404
I don't believe this. Hold on a second.
You guys die..

11:46.579 --> 11:49.072
and I don't get your baby?

11:49.284 --> 11:52.621
Amy, see, we're a lot closer
to Monica and Chandler.

11:52.791 --> 11:57.061
We see them every day. And truthfully,
you don't seem connected to the baby.

11:57.266 --> 12:00.831
Connected? To what? She's a lump.

12:03.478 --> 12:06.314
You know, guys, I've gotta say
this means so much to me.

12:06.519 --> 12:09.821
I mean, that you would
trust me with your child.

12:09.992 --> 12:12.623
I mean, we all know
that Monica and I have been..

12:12.798 --> 12:15.132
trying to have a baby of our own.

12:15.302 --> 12:20.507
You know, I've had my doubts
about my skills as a father, but..

12:22.016 --> 12:24.111
That you two..

12:24.655 --> 12:27.752
- That you two..
- This guy?

12:29.030 --> 12:30.556
Seriously?

12:36.011 --> 12:38.208
Okay, it's time for dinner.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.081
Everyone, we're using our fancy china..

12:41.254 --> 12:45.194
and it's very expensive,
so please be careful.

12:52.043 --> 12:55.744
Okay, just to be clear, comedy with
the plates will not be well-received.

13:03.398 --> 13:05.163
Hey!

13:05.335 --> 13:09.275
How come my plate's less fancy
than everyone else's?

13:10.412 --> 13:12.975
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

13:13.151 --> 13:16.282
No, honey. That's a special plate.

13:16.458 --> 13:20.159
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.502
I can't believe I won!

13:25.476 --> 13:28.779
You know, this is such a slap
in the face. I mean, I'm your sister..

13:28.950 --> 13:32.890
and you would give your baby
to these strangers over me.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.619
Monica is Ross' sister.

13:36.164 --> 13:39.968
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

13:41.509 --> 13:42.909
That was me.

13:43.646 --> 13:48.087
No, she was this dorky girl in school
who followed Rachel around like a puppy..

13:48.355 --> 13:50.656
Amy, you've got to stop doing that!

13:56.739 --> 13:59.609
Okay, listen, I know you're having
a bit of a family crisis..

13:59.811 --> 14:02.373
but you don't have to take it out
on the plates.

14:02.551 --> 14:05.386
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone..

14:05.557 --> 14:09.462
should cut their food like this:

14:11.769 --> 14:14.707
Now, see? This way,
you protect the plates..

14:15.042 --> 14:16.944
and let's face it, you have fun.

14:18.716 --> 14:21.482
Okay, how about this?
If you guys die..

14:21.655 --> 14:25.492
and the crazy plate lady dies..

14:26.431 --> 14:29.734
- then do I get the baby?
- No, if crazy plate lady..

14:32.476 --> 14:36.314
If Monica dies,
then I would get Emma. Right?

14:39.791 --> 14:42.592
- Well, actually..
- Actually what?

14:42.797 --> 14:46.167
It's just..
It's just that in that case..

14:46.337 --> 14:48.273
then Emma would go to my parents.

14:48.776 --> 14:50.905
- What?
- Hurts, doesn't it?

14:54.453 --> 14:56.389
Who has to die for me to get her?

15:01.267 --> 15:04.570
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?

15:04.775 --> 15:07.177
No, that is not what we're saying.

15:07.379 --> 15:09.110
Yeah, he's lying. He looked down.

15:11.655 --> 15:13.784
Well, what's wrong with me?
Am I incompetent?

15:13.993 --> 15:17.592
Because I managed to survive whatever
it is that killed the three of you!

15:20.339 --> 15:25.372
You're taking this the wrong way. We think
you are going to be a wonderful parent.

15:25.550 --> 15:29.216
It's just.. You're more the,
you know, fun parent.

15:29.390 --> 15:33.593
Yeah, and we wanna make sure
Emma also has someone like Monica..

15:33.766 --> 15:35.668
who's more of a disciplinarian.

15:35.837 --> 15:38.707
Someone who can be firm and strict.

15:38.876 --> 15:41.438
That's not how you see me, is it?

15:42.550 --> 15:45.077
No, you're all about the fun.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.934
I may not know a lot about babies,
but do you really think I'm not capable?

15:55.175 --> 15:57.874
No. You both are equally capable.

15:58.047 --> 16:00.610
It's just you're strongest
when you're together.

16:00.820 --> 16:04.692
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died..

16:05.328 --> 16:07.059
she'd have to give her up.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.330
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.844
I lie better than that, right?

16:15.248 --> 16:19.188
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die, I get Emma.

16:19.356 --> 16:23.456
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
the one tiny ray of hope left in my life..

16:23.632 --> 16:27.127
- gets taken away from me?
- There's your movie.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.150
Hey, there you are.

16:36.324 --> 16:39.525
- You disappeared after dinner.
- Did somebody miss me?

16:39.764 --> 16:42.668
Was there a child to raise poorly?

16:43.204 --> 16:45.436
Ross and Rachel don't know
what they're saying.

16:45.643 --> 16:47.510
It's not like they're so responsible.

16:47.680 --> 16:52.144
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
and a five-year-old condom.

16:53.993 --> 16:57.990
No, but they're right. I'm not a strong
father figure, and I never will be.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.865
No, you learn these things.
You grow into it.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.872
Yeah, but it's not who I am.

17:03.077 --> 17:08.213
Everything they said is exactly why I was
worried about having a kid. And it's true.

17:08.388 --> 17:11.360
- And look, everybody knows it.
- I don't know it.

17:11.528 --> 17:15.092
I wanna have a kid with you because
I think you'll be an amazing dad.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.899
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.

17:18.107 --> 17:21.603
Well, can you picture me saying,
"Go to your room, you're grounded"?

17:22.449 --> 17:24.818
Can you hear me say,
"You're grounded"?

17:25.021 --> 17:27.457
You said that to me last week.

17:29.296 --> 17:32.792
How hard is it?
"No shoes on the furniture!"

17:39.350 --> 17:43.484
The producer from Days left a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.

17:43.692 --> 17:47.860
They said everybody's really pissed off
at me. And they all got to meet Santa!

17:49.571 --> 17:51.973
It's okay.
I thought of the perfect lie for you.

17:52.175 --> 17:55.637
It's easy to remember,
and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.815
Does it have something to do
with a spaceship?

17:58.989 --> 18:01.391
The Statue of Liberty came to life..

18:03.732 --> 18:07.797
You weren't at the parade
because you had a family emergency.

18:07.974 --> 18:10.342
I like that! Yeah!

18:10.513 --> 18:13.382
I wasn't at the parade
because I had a family emergency.

18:13.786 --> 18:15.756
What happened?

18:15.923 --> 18:18.986
- My sister's raccoon came..
- No, nothing with a raccoon!

18:22.135 --> 18:24.971
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Setting the table.

18:25.141 --> 18:28.979
We thought it might be nice
to use the fancy china for dessert too.

18:29.216 --> 18:32.781
How nice. Maybe later we can all go
blow our noses on my wedding dress.

18:40.038 --> 18:42.372
Hey, dude, you okay?
Sorry about before.

18:42.543 --> 18:46.779
That's okay. You're totally right. I don't
know anything about disciplining a child.

18:46.952 --> 18:51.484
But it did hurt my feelings,
and I want you to know that if I die..

18:51.661 --> 18:53.893
you don't get Joey.

19:07.693 --> 19:10.722
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not talking to you.

19:12.870 --> 19:15.603
You know, this is just..
This is classic Rachel.

19:15.843 --> 19:20.307
Oh, yeah, right. Remember in high school
when I died and didn't give you my baby?

19:22.890 --> 19:25.828
This might be my one chance
to have a child, Rachel.

19:26.030 --> 19:29.366
I mean, you know that I have been
so busy focusing on my career..

19:29.537 --> 19:33.340
- What career?
- I'm a decorator.

19:33.545 --> 19:36.915
You decorate Dad's office
and now you're a decorator?

19:37.085 --> 19:41.754
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,
now I'm a koala bear.

19:44.601 --> 19:48.404
- Why can't you ever be supportive?
- You wanna talk supportive?

19:48.575 --> 19:52.344
You didn't come and visit me when
I was in the hospital having the baby!

19:52.583 --> 19:56.580
You didn't come see me in the hospital
when I was getting my lips done!

19:58.060 --> 20:00.223
I did the first time.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.875
You know what? You wanna know
why I am not giving Emily to you?

20:06.043 --> 20:08.479
- Emma.
- Whose side are you on?!

20:09.851 --> 20:14.383
I'm not giving you Emma because you
can't handle the responsibility of a child.

20:14.894 --> 20:18.264
Well, how hard could it be?
You do it.

20:22.677 --> 20:25.945
You wanna know why
you don't want me to have the baby?

20:26.116 --> 20:28.382
Because you don't want me to be happy.

20:28.555 --> 20:32.187
- You have always been jealous of me.
- Jealous of what?

20:32.362 --> 20:36.063
Of your lack of responsibility?
Your immaturity?

20:36.236 --> 20:39.231
Your total disregard
for other people's feelings?

20:39.443 --> 20:41.778
To name a few.

20:43.652 --> 20:45.280
You've always been like this.

20:45.455 --> 20:48.895
You had to have everything,
and I couldn't have anything.

20:49.062 --> 20:52.262
Like in junior high,
when you stole Timmy from me.

20:52.435 --> 20:55.305
I mean, do you even realize
how much that hurt me?

20:55.542 --> 20:57.978
Timmy was my boyfriend,
and you made out with him!

20:58.180 --> 21:01.277
Come on, that was 20 years ago.
Get over it.

21:01.588 --> 21:04.526
I cannot believe
that I invited you here today!

21:04.694 --> 21:08.634
Yeah, well, you know what I cannot
believe? That my so-called sister..

21:08.802 --> 21:13.642
gets a 30 percent discount from Ralph
Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?

21:16.050 --> 21:17.576
It's 45.

21:18.955 --> 21:20.788
You bitch.

21:23.330 --> 21:25.300
You just think you're so perfect..

21:25.468 --> 21:29.169
with your new baby
and your small apartment.

21:30.646 --> 21:35.816
Well, let me tell you something.
Your baby isn't even that cute.

21:37.192 --> 21:40.893
Too far, Amy. Too far.

21:43.137 --> 21:45.164
- You take that back.
- No.

21:45.374 --> 21:47.811
- Take it back!
- No. What are you gonna do? Make me?

21:48.013 --> 21:50.917
Hey, man, I work out!

21:52.523 --> 21:54.424
- So do I.
- I do Pilates.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.356
- I do yoga.
- Bring it on!

21:56.898 --> 21:59.768
Put the plates in the boxes!
Put the plates in the boxes!

22:02.242 --> 22:04.679
- Did you just push me?
- Yeah, I think I did.

22:04.881 --> 22:06.179
All right, that's it.

22:06.383 --> 22:09.184
Forget the bubble wrap!
There isn't time!

22:11.426 --> 22:13.225
Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!

22:18.040 --> 22:20.705
- Shouldn't we stop this?
- Are you out of your mind?

22:20.879 --> 22:23.247
Let's throw some Jell-O on them!

22:25.789 --> 22:27.223
Hey, someone could get hurt.

22:27.392 --> 22:29.955
Kick her, Rach! Kick her!

22:30.131 --> 22:33.035
Pull her top off, Rach! Pull her top off!

22:37.947 --> 22:39.610
Gross!

22:51.273 --> 22:56.238
All right, that is it! This is our apartment,
and you cannot behave this way!

22:56.416 --> 22:59.183
If you can't act your age,
you shouldn't be here at all.

22:59.389 --> 23:04.297
Those plates may not be as nice as
the pretty pink ones that I picked out..

23:05.167 --> 23:10.235
but they're important to Monica.
And I want you to apologize to her, now.

23:10.512 --> 23:13.039
- I'm sorry.
- Mon, I'm so sorry.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.119
Okay. That's better.

23:15.321 --> 23:18.658
Now, I want you to apologize
to each other and mean it.

23:19.262 --> 23:20.697
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

23:20.899 --> 23:24.235
By the way, that fight
was totally arousing.

23:28.447 --> 23:30.383
Dude, well done.

23:30.585 --> 23:35.618
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
you can totally take care of Emma.

23:36.363 --> 23:38.128
Yeah? Well, thanks.

23:38.635 --> 23:41.766
So..
So now do I get Joey?

23:43.645 --> 23:48.484
Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
and shoves pennies up his nose.

23:53.631 --> 23:55.794
Are you okay, Mon?

23:55.969 --> 23:59.670
I mean, these things happen.
I mean, it's just a plate.

23:59.844 --> 24:03.614
- It's not like somebody died.
- It's all right. You can mourn.

24:03.985 --> 24:07.925
Thank you. It was so beautiful!

24:10.064 --> 24:12.330
I'm gonna go to Joey's
and get the pies.

24:12.536 --> 24:16.305
Actually, not pies. It's just pie.

24:17.679 --> 24:19.876
I don't care.

24:20.050 --> 24:23.649
Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.828
Look, Amy..

24:30.271 --> 24:31.865
we got a little..

24:32.041 --> 24:34.877
a little out-of-control over there.

24:35.582 --> 24:37.050
And I'm sorry.

24:37.218 --> 24:39.781
You're my sister..

24:39.990 --> 24:42.392
and if it really means
that much to you..

24:42.729 --> 24:45.701
- So you're gonna give me the baby?
- No, I was..

24:45.869 --> 24:48.932
I was gonna let you use
my Ralph Lauren discount.

24:50.311 --> 24:53.249
You are not gonna regret this.

24:56.122 --> 24:59.322
- She needs changing.
- No, no, no. I'll get her.

24:59.563 --> 25:04.061
I am super confident, totally responsible
and fourth in line to raise Emma.

25:04.239 --> 25:08.613
I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me
get my trusty diaper bag here.

25:14.158 --> 25:17.255
Well, what do you know?
I guess I'll be the one who dies first.

25:27.218 --> 25:30.885
- Does Monica know about her plates?
- Nope.

25:31.126 --> 25:32.618
- Broke them all, huh?
- Yep.

25:32.829 --> 25:34.662
- You gonna tell her?
- Nope.

25:36.737 --> 25:40.335
Hey. So I'm gonna
put the plates back.

25:40.512 --> 25:43.882
I think you're right. We shouldn't
use these plates for a long time.

25:44.052 --> 25:47.548
- Like only if the queen comes?
- Maybe not even then.

25:48.661 --> 25:50.186
Hey. I did it.

25:50.397 --> 25:53.893
I told my producer I had a family
emergency. He totally bought it.

25:54.072 --> 25:58.741
- Thanks for teaching me how to lie.
- No problem. Next week, stealing.

26:00.117 --> 26:03.089
- Bye, plates.
- You told her you broke all the plates?

26:05.427 --> 26:08.263
What?!
Something happened with the plates?

26:09.903 --> 26:12.898
Yeah, this raccoon came in..
