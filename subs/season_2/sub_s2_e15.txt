WEBVTT

00:01.619 --> 00:03.246
All right, no peeking.

00:03.496 --> 00:04.330
No peeking.

00:04.580 --> 00:06.416
No peeking. No peeking!

00:06.666 --> 00:12.088
All right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

00:13.131 --> 00:16.551
All right. Open your eyes!

00:20.012 --> 00:24.058
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure!

00:24.308 --> 00:26.018
<i>Days of our Lives</i>
picked up my option!

00:26.269 --> 00:29.147
- Congratulations!
- I know!

00:29.397 --> 00:34.610
Now we can watch <i>Green Acres</i>
the way it was meant to be seen.

00:35.778 --> 00:37.029
So which one is mine?

00:37.280 --> 00:42.076
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

00:42.326 --> 00:45.455
Not that one.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.293
Oh, yes!

00:50.543 --> 00:54.839
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.009
Do we dare?

00:58.259 --> 01:00.720
We dare.

01:05.474 --> 01:08.686
The One Where Ross and Rachel...
You Know

01:52.590 --> 01:55.385
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

01:55.635 --> 01:57.971
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

01:58.221 --> 02:00.974
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

02:01.224 --> 02:04.185
They never would have survived
in the wild.

02:04.435 --> 02:10.233
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

02:11.276 --> 02:15.071
Rose Marie belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

02:15.321 --> 02:17.866
Hi, you guys.

02:18.116 --> 02:21.077
Hey, you.

02:26.457 --> 02:27.542
How was your day?

02:27.792 --> 02:30.211
You know, pretty much the usual.

02:30.461 --> 02:32.213
Sun shining, birds chirping.

02:32.463 --> 02:33.590
Really? Mine too.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.427
Hey, cool! Mine too!

02:39.095 --> 02:41.848
I gotta get to the museum.

02:42.098 --> 02:45.351
So I'll see you tonight?

02:50.732 --> 02:53.443
Bye, guys!

02:54.444 --> 02:57.238
Tonight?

02:58.506 --> 03:01.050
- What's tonight?
- Our first official date.

03:01.300 --> 03:04.679
Our first date.

03:04.804 --> 03:06.681
Hello?

03:06.931 --> 03:09.600
Hi.

03:09.767 --> 03:12.687
You're supposed to waitress for me?
My catering thing?

03:12.937 --> 03:16.482
- Any of that trigger anything?
- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

03:16.733 --> 03:18.234
This is our first date.

03:18.484 --> 03:21.487
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.
- I can be a waitress!

03:21.738 --> 03:24.866
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

03:25.116 --> 03:28.161
Really, Pheebs?
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

03:28.411 --> 03:31.414
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

03:31.664 --> 03:34.167
I can be a waitress.
Okay, watch this.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.669
Give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

03:36.919 --> 03:41.132
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

03:53.853 --> 03:56.481
It's James Bond!

03:57.273 --> 04:00.443
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay. Come on in.

04:00.693 --> 04:03.488
Is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

04:03.738 --> 04:05.573
Dr. Burke, it's me.

04:05.823 --> 04:07.158
Monica?

04:07.408 --> 04:09.410
My God! You used to be so...

04:09.660 --> 04:14.582
I mean, you've...
You must have lost like...

04:15.875 --> 04:17.126
You look great.

04:17.376 --> 04:18.169
Thank you.

04:18.419 --> 04:20.588
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

04:20.838 --> 04:23.841
Nice to meet you.

04:27.345 --> 04:30.473
- So how you been?
- Great. How have you been?

04:30.723 --> 04:32.808
Obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

04:33.059 --> 04:34.977
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

04:35.228 --> 04:36.520
The head tilt?

04:36.771 --> 04:39.065
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

04:39.315 --> 04:43.527
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

04:43.778 --> 04:45.321
I'm sorry.

04:45.571 --> 04:47.782
It's fine.
Believe me, I do it too.

04:48.032 --> 04:52.286
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

04:52.536 --> 04:53.329
"You're sure?"

04:53.579 --> 04:55.456
"Yeah, I'm fine."

04:55.706 --> 04:58.251
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

04:58.501 --> 05:02.421
Of course, the divorce only left
me with four CDs to change.

05:02.672 --> 05:04.382
That's too bad.

05:04.632 --> 05:07.885
I'll survive.

05:10.054 --> 05:13.557
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

05:13.808 --> 05:15.226
But listen...

05:15.476 --> 05:18.062
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

05:18.312 --> 05:20.982
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

05:21.232 --> 05:25.403
They'll let you in, okay?

05:26.320 --> 05:30.157
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

05:30.408 --> 05:33.327
Okay, thanks.

05:33.869 --> 05:38.374
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

05:38.624 --> 05:42.086
What if we have to pee?

05:43.754 --> 05:47.508
I'll cancel the sodas.

05:50.394 --> 05:52.313
Get back out there.
It's your party!

05:52.563 --> 05:55.899
But they're so dull!
They're all ophthalmologists.

05:56.150 --> 05:57.443
You're an ophthalmologist.

05:57.693 --> 06:02.531
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

06:03.323 --> 06:06.285
That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

06:06.535 --> 06:09.455
But you stay out there!

06:09.705 --> 06:11.415
- You see?
- I tell you what.

06:11.665 --> 06:17.796
I'll come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebob emergency.

06:18.047 --> 06:19.006
Better.

06:19.256 --> 06:21.258
Oh, God, here we go.

06:21.508 --> 06:23.552
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

06:23.802 --> 06:25.929
Watch this.

06:26.180 --> 06:29.349
Who needs glasses?

06:35.272 --> 06:36.982
You are so smitten.

06:37.232 --> 06:38.609
I am not!

06:38.859 --> 06:42.738
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

06:43.238 --> 06:45.324
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

06:45.574 --> 06:50.120
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grownup.

06:50.370 --> 06:53.791
So? You two are
totally into each other.

06:54.041 --> 06:57.503
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

06:57.753 --> 07:00.464
So you're never gonna see him again?

07:00.714 --> 07:02.633
Not never.

07:02.883 --> 07:06.678
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

07:06.929 --> 07:10.557
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
- Yeah, but you know...

07:10.808 --> 07:12.768
...27 is...

07:13.018 --> 07:16.605
...a dangerous eye age.

07:16.702 --> 07:20.868
They're picking teams to play
"guess my prescription." Help me!

07:25.883 --> 07:30.179
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

07:30.430 --> 07:32.014
...hard to follow.

07:32.265 --> 07:34.183
I told you there'd be subtitles.

07:34.434 --> 07:36.978
I know.

07:37.103 --> 07:42.150
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

07:48.823 --> 07:51.409
Monica?

07:53.536 --> 07:58.166
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.877
Honey, I'm just checking.

08:01.127 --> 08:04.088
- Monica?
- Mon?

08:34.243 --> 08:36.120
What?

08:36.370 --> 08:37.538
I'm sorry.

08:37.788 --> 08:40.833
It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

08:41.083 --> 08:45.546
...it was, like, "Whoa!
Ross' hands are on my butt!"

08:46.297 --> 08:49.675
And that's funny. Why?

08:49.926 --> 08:51.552
Well, it's not.

08:51.802 --> 08:54.013
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

08:54.263 --> 08:56.224
I mean, it's you.

08:56.474 --> 08:58.017
You know, it's us.

08:58.267 --> 09:01.938
We're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

09:02.188 --> 09:08.069
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

09:18.162 --> 09:20.915
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

09:21.165 --> 09:22.583
I know, I know, I know!

09:22.833 --> 09:25.962
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

09:26.212 --> 09:28.714
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! I promise.

09:28.965 --> 09:31.968
I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

09:32.218 --> 09:35.638
No, see, now I can't.

09:35.888 --> 09:38.761
- I feel self-conscious.
- Come on! Touch my butt!

09:40.526 --> 09:41.606
Just one cheek.

09:42.984 --> 09:43.943
The moment's gone.

09:44.193 --> 09:47.363
- I'll back up into your hands.
- That's romantic.

09:47.613 --> 09:48.447
<i>- Touch it.
- No.</i>

09:48.698 --> 09:50.533
<i>- Oh, come on, squeeze it.
- No!</i>

09:50.783 --> 09:51.701
<i>Rub it?</i>

09:51.951 --> 09:56.205
<i>Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?</i>

10:01.737 --> 10:05.073
Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

10:05.324 --> 10:08.368
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

10:08.619 --> 10:13.457
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

10:13.957 --> 10:17.836
You've got a Cheeto
on your face, man.

10:27.554 --> 10:30.265
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

10:31.015 --> 10:34.269
That was 14 hours ago.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.565
We gotta set the clock
on this thing.

10:39.019 --> 10:40.896
So how'd it go?

10:41.946 --> 10:46.534
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

10:46.784 --> 10:50.121
...and she started laughing?

10:50.955 --> 10:52.331
But it was 1982...

10:52.582 --> 10:57.837
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

10:59.464 --> 11:01.174
She laughed at you?

11:01.297 --> 11:04.831
It could've been worse.
I could've been naked.

11:10.624 --> 11:13.585
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

11:13.835 --> 11:17.005
And I just want it to be perfect...

11:17.255 --> 11:20.133
...and right and...

11:20.384 --> 11:23.595
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

11:23.845 --> 11:27.099
- It's the Miracle Wax!
- It certainly is a miracle.

11:27.349 --> 11:29.643
Hi, you guys.

11:31.019 --> 11:33.438
Listen, I was thinking about...

11:33.689 --> 11:35.065
Can you guys speak up?

11:35.315 --> 11:39.986
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

11:39.987 --> 11:41.043
- Hallway?
- Yeah.

11:46.763 --> 11:51.351
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

11:51.601 --> 11:53.853
There's no need to make it up...

11:54.104 --> 11:56.648
How?

11:56.815 --> 12:00.777
Well, I was thinking
maybe a romantic dinner...

12:01.027 --> 12:04.823
...with candles and wine.

12:05.073 --> 12:09.494
And then maybe going
back to my place...

12:09.744 --> 12:12.622
...for dessert.

12:12.872 --> 12:14.290
That sounds...

12:14.541 --> 12:17.293
...perfect?

12:24.050 --> 12:24.926
What's this?

12:25.176 --> 12:28.972
Would you get us a couple of beers?

12:32.892 --> 12:35.353
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

12:35.603 --> 12:37.480
Really?

12:37.730 --> 12:40.233
That's my job.

12:40.525 --> 12:41.317
All right.

12:41.568 --> 12:43.945
Look up.

12:44.195 --> 12:45.154
Look down.

12:45.405 --> 12:48.241
Now, open your eyes and look down.

12:48.491 --> 12:49.659
That's right.

12:49.909 --> 12:52.620
Look into the light.

12:52.871 --> 12:56.082
Now look at me.

13:06.009 --> 13:08.928
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

13:09.178 --> 13:11.598
Good. They feel good.

13:11.848 --> 13:14.434
In my head.

13:18.396 --> 13:21.858
- It was great to see you.
- You too.

13:22.108 --> 13:24.485
You too.

13:27.864 --> 13:30.533
Goodbye.

13:31.117 --> 13:33.453
Drops!

13:33.703 --> 13:36.789
Here, they're free.

13:38.207 --> 13:40.793
Thanks.

13:41.294 --> 13:42.503
I better be going.

13:42.754 --> 13:44.422
Yeah, I'll see you later.

13:44.672 --> 13:47.592
Thanks again.

14:00.313 --> 14:04.525
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

14:06.694 --> 14:10.990
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.786
No. Inside good.

14:15.036 --> 14:17.872
Outside bad.

14:18.122 --> 14:20.249
You guys are so pathetic.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.503
Oh, <i>Xanadu</i>!

14:25.922 --> 14:29.717
She's one of us now.

14:32.637 --> 14:35.306
We just wanted to stop by
and say good night.

14:35.556 --> 14:37.683
Good night.

14:37.934 --> 14:39.811
They won't even turn their heads.

14:40.061 --> 14:44.524
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

14:48.903 --> 14:52.198
She's lying.

14:52.407 --> 14:57.870
Stop sending food to our apartment!

14:57.870 --> 14:59.163
Why are you dressed up?

14:59.414 --> 15:01.249
You're not the only one
with a date.

15:01.499 --> 15:03.876
- What? You have a date? Who with?
- No one.

15:04.127 --> 15:05.795
Come on, what's his name?

15:06.045 --> 15:07.422
Nothing.

15:07.672 --> 15:09.424
Come on, tell me.

15:09.674 --> 15:12.510
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

15:12.760 --> 15:15.763
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

15:16.013 --> 15:17.348
I promise. What?

15:17.598 --> 15:20.017
- It's Richard Burke.
- Who's Richard Burke?

15:20.268 --> 15:22.562
Dr. Burke?

15:22.812 --> 15:25.982
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

15:26.232 --> 15:28.651
...should that bother me?

15:28.901 --> 15:30.695
I love that man.
He's like a...

15:30.945 --> 15:33.781
...a brother to Dad.

15:36.422 --> 15:37.651
- Here we go.
- What? No.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.598
I think it's great he's, like, 50.

15:39.599 --> 15:43.050
I mean,
he'll be an inspiration to men...

15:43.085 --> 15:45.147
...who are almost retired
all over the world.

15:46.231 --> 15:51.153
He is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

15:51.403 --> 15:52.571
Dr. Burke is sexy?

15:52.821 --> 15:57.034
Oh, God! Absolutely!

15:57.493 --> 15:58.619
Damn!

15:58.869 --> 16:02.498
It's the museum again.
Can I...?

16:02.498 --> 16:04.833
- Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

16:05.084 --> 16:09.213
When I was 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

16:09.463 --> 16:13.175
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

16:13.425 --> 16:16.428
- Oh, you are so lucky!
- I know.

16:16.678 --> 16:22.017
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

16:22.351 --> 16:26.730
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

16:26.980 --> 16:30.567
Well, maybe he was nervous.

16:36.198 --> 16:38.659
Oh, look!
I can't believe this!

16:38.909 --> 16:43.038
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

16:43.288 --> 16:46.875
Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

16:46.876 --> 16:49.411
Clearly, honey, he'd have
no place to plug it in.

16:55.626 --> 16:57.753
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

16:58.003 --> 17:01.006
It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

17:01.256 --> 17:02.174
That's okay.

17:02.424 --> 17:05.427
Karl!

17:06.136 --> 17:09.306
Oh, God.

17:20.442 --> 17:23.195
- Wow! Is that Michelle?
- Yep.

17:23.445 --> 17:26.031
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

17:26.281 --> 17:30.786
Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru...

17:31.703 --> 17:32.996
Emotional.

17:33.246 --> 17:35.665
You know, she's having another baby.

17:35.916 --> 17:39.878
- I thought she just had one.
- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

17:40.128 --> 17:44.091
And he's talking
and everything. Here.

17:44.341 --> 17:48.178
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

17:48.428 --> 17:53.308
In all fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but still...

17:54.643 --> 17:57.896
You're a grandpa.

18:05.821 --> 18:07.864
Are we nuts here?

18:08.115 --> 18:10.909
I don't know. Maybe.

18:11.159 --> 18:15.163
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

18:15.413 --> 18:18.375
I didn't need to know that.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.211
I guess 21 years is a lot.

18:21.461 --> 18:27.717
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

18:36.143 --> 18:40.647
So maybe we should just...

18:42.023 --> 18:44.526
Maybe...

18:47.479 --> 18:50.023
Wow.

18:51.232 --> 18:52.567
This really sucks.

18:52.817 --> 18:56.696
Yeah, it sure does.

19:12.796 --> 19:16.007
We don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

19:16.257 --> 19:19.761
No, there's no rush or anything.

19:20.011 --> 19:25.058
- Pizza delivery!
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

19:28.186 --> 19:30.105
I'm done.

19:30.355 --> 19:33.483
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is Sorentino's.

19:33.733 --> 19:36.986
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find someplace else?

19:37.237 --> 19:40.657
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

19:40.907 --> 19:42.283
No, no, we won't.

19:42.534 --> 19:44.327
We won't?

19:44.577 --> 19:46.204
Come on.

19:46.454 --> 19:49.916
Okay, that's dead, right?

19:50.708 --> 19:52.293
What are we doing?

19:52.544 --> 19:57.590
- Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?
- Grape.

19:58.341 --> 19:59.843
Okay, now...

20:00.093 --> 20:02.804
...sit.

20:06.015 --> 20:09.018
Oh, my God!

20:09.269 --> 20:14.274
<i>Billions of years ago,
Earth was only...</i>

20:14.691 --> 20:17.277
Sorry.

20:21.072 --> 20:23.116
So what are we looking at?

20:23.366 --> 20:27.662
Well, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

20:27.912 --> 20:30.707
That is Ursa Major.

20:30.957 --> 20:35.545
- Really?
- No idea. It could be.

20:37.213 --> 20:39.841
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

20:40.091 --> 20:41.968
Oh, that's okay.

20:42.218 --> 20:44.888
You were worth the wait.

20:45.138 --> 20:48.891
And I don't just mean tonight.

20:57.025 --> 20:59.068
You're not laughing.

20:59.319 --> 21:03.072
This time it's not so funny.

21:34.604 --> 21:37.065
Oh, God!

21:37.231 --> 21:38.399
Honey?

21:38.649 --> 21:40.943
That's okay.

21:41.194 --> 21:42.945
What?

21:43.196 --> 21:47.742
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.794
Thank God!

22:26.280 --> 22:28.991
Hey, you.

22:33.788 --> 22:36.833
I can't believe I'm waking up
next to you.

22:37.083 --> 22:40.795
I know. It is pretty unbel...

22:41.838 --> 22:45.258
We're not alone.

23:12.016 --> 23:15.645
Is that the fire alarm?

23:19.107 --> 23:22.902
It's not warm yet.
We still have time.

23:23.152 --> 23:27.156
- Cool.
- <i>Yeah, yeah. Cool!</i>
