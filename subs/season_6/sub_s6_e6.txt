WEBVTT

00:07.641 --> 00:11.441
I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.836
-When's it due?
-On the first.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.512
And that's every month?

00:16.283 --> 00:18.478
No, just the months
you want to live here.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.021
Okay, here's the phone bill.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.781
Oh, my God!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.857
That's our phone number.

00:29.329 --> 00:32.526
I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.325
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!

00:36.570 --> 00:39.733
Joey Tribbiani does not
take charity...

00:40.474 --> 00:41.668
anymore.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.473
-It's not charity, Joe.
-Forget it.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.909
Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

00:48.148 --> 00:51.208
I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.

00:51.518 --> 00:52.917
Here's the electric bill.

00:53.186 --> 00:56.747
-This is how much we pay for electric?
-Well, yeah.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.394
So we'll do
the rest of the bills later, then?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.329
The One On The Last Night

01:41.835 --> 01:44.167
Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.668
I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.339
How much does he need?

01:48.575 --> 01:51.066
$1500 would cover him
for a few months...

01:51.278 --> 01:55.078
but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.307
Why don't you hire him as an actor?

01:58.518 --> 02:02.614
You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.

02:04.524 --> 02:07.118
Well, that would help the pride thing.

02:09.696 --> 02:13.598
Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?

02:16.937 --> 02:18.427
Any plans for tonight?

02:18.672 --> 02:21.163
Instead of being sad on my
last night with Rachel...

02:21.375 --> 02:25.334
we're going out to celebrate
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.775
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.

02:29.383 --> 02:34.286
What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.

02:37.224 --> 02:40.125
You guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

02:40.394 --> 02:44.125
Instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

02:45.899 --> 02:50.336
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.

02:50.537 --> 02:51.868
I don't know, Ross.

02:52.139 --> 02:56.007
Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.

02:56.243 --> 03:00.805
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist!

03:01.648 --> 03:03.809
-Phoebe..
-You're not dressed yet?

03:04.051 --> 03:06.747
We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

03:07.754 --> 03:10.746
And clearly, not a minute sooner.

03:11.491 --> 03:15.154
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?

03:15.395 --> 03:18.592
Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.198
I wanted to ask Phoebe
what I should wear.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.995
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.605
Oh, my God!

03:31.611 --> 03:33.909
Monica's just gonna kill you.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.341
I know.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.608
What you're wearing is fine
for that.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.613
You're not packed!

03:44.124 --> 03:46.592
You're not packed even a little bit!

03:47.761 --> 03:49.023
Surprise!

03:51.098 --> 03:53.293
Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.036
I started packing,
then I realized, "What am I doing?"

03:57.237 --> 03:59.967
I am lousy at packing, right?

04:00.474 --> 04:01.941
But you love packing!

04:02.209 --> 04:06.111
So as a gift to you
on our last night....

04:10.984 --> 04:12.713
I'll be coordinator!

04:12.953 --> 04:16.320
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.315
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.890
I have plans.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.794
-You have plans with us.
-That's right.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.230
Chandler can make boxes, Ross can
wrap and Joey can lift.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.595
Tell the guys
they have to help out.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.634
My God, thank you!

04:33.974 --> 04:36.465
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!

04:36.743 --> 04:40.076
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves!

04:42.415 --> 04:45.612
The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.820
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler..

04:48.088 --> 04:49.953
I have plans with Joey.

04:50.757 --> 04:54.818
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.961
Fine. Now, Ross..

04:58.198 --> 05:00.598
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

05:00.834 --> 05:04.292
-Don't you have Ben?
-Because I have Ben!

05:05.338 --> 05:07.932
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.540
He's at a dinner party.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.674
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.143
Of course he is. What?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.944
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.519
What kind of father do you think I am?

05:23.190 --> 05:24.282
All right. Sorry.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.483
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.121
Here it is.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.858
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.503
I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.399
Well, that's okay.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.006
In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

05:43.243 --> 05:47.202
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

05:47.480 --> 05:49.641
you, the food of yours!

05:54.387 --> 05:57.049
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.

05:57.257 --> 06:00.192
What do you say we play a little
foosball for money?

06:00.427 --> 06:04.420
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.395
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.493
What do you say to $50?

06:12.105 --> 06:16.906
I say to it:
"50 dollars, you are more than I have."

06:17.577 --> 06:20.239
If you know that you'll win,
what difference does it make?

06:20.413 --> 06:22.506
-You're on.
-Okay, let's play.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.616
The big game. Italy versus...

06:24.885 --> 06:26.409
China, apparently.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.687
Look, it's the Rollerblades.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.393
Oh, God!

06:34.928 --> 06:37.761
You remember when we got these?

06:40.867 --> 06:42.425
I guess you weren't there.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.037
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.071
Come on. Hey, remember the time....

06:55.382 --> 06:56.872
You don't remember?

06:57.951 --> 07:01.318
Sorry, Phoebe. I'm just really sad
that I'm leaving.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.419
I'm gonna miss you so much.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.922
This doesn't have to be so sad,
though, you know?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.254
Instead of thinking about
how you'll miss each other...

07:10.463 --> 07:14.229
you should think of the things
you're not gonna miss.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.931
I don't think there's anything.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.401
Come on, there's gotta be something.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.571
She's perfect.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.006
I have one.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.607
Okay, you can go first.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.148
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...

07:33.420 --> 07:37.447
that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.619
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

07:43.863 --> 07:46.127
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

07:47.367 --> 07:48.925
Sometimes.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.535
Always, actually.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.771
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

07:57.377 --> 07:59.311
Not just the phone pen.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.608
I never get my messages.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.374
You get your messages.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.778
It doesn't count if you have to
read them off your hand...

08:08.021 --> 08:10.888
after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.684
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.359
Or your mom?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.527
Or Chandler?

08:17.731 --> 08:18.891
Or your mom?

08:22.969 --> 08:24.732
It worked! No one's sad!

08:28.908 --> 08:29.897
I win again!

08:30.176 --> 08:33.077
That's, like, 500 bucks
you owe me!

08:33.346 --> 08:35.678
Man! Five hundred dollars.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.145
That is a lot of electricity, huh?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.882
I gotta buy some food.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.589
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death...

08:45.892 --> 08:48.554
one goal, $1000.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.652
-You serious?
-Yes!

08:52.432 --> 08:54.195
Get ready to owe me.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.731
Here we go. Ready?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.551
No...

09:23.730 --> 09:24.958
one can beat me!

09:29.569 --> 09:33.403
That's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.479
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!

09:42.749 --> 09:45.411
Oh, your brother. Score!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.251
What's up?

09:48.488 --> 09:49.716
I'm here with Ben.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.547
Thought we'd say hi.

09:51.791 --> 09:55.318
-Put him on.
-Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

09:57.230 --> 10:00.825
I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.558
He's smiling, though.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.661
Okay, talk to you later.

10:13.580 --> 10:17.539
You know, Daddy was gonna be
a basketball player.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.148
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.860
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?

10:31.698 --> 10:34.166
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.801
I wash the toilets 17 times a day,
even if people are on it!"

10:39.038 --> 10:41.734
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight?

10:42.008 --> 10:44.408
I'd better wash it and shrink it!"

10:45.311 --> 10:48.838
"I'm Monica. I never get messages
from interesting people."

10:49.048 --> 10:50.845
I call her.

10:51.751 --> 10:56.882
"Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate
Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross!"

10:58.224 --> 10:59.987
"My God!
I can't find a boyfriend.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.390
I'll stumble across the hall and sleep
with the first guy I find there!"

11:06.633 --> 11:08.999
You guys, come on,
this is the last night!

11:09.169 --> 11:12.935
Yeah, you're right, and so for the last time
I would like to ask you:

11:13.106 --> 11:15.506
Boo-hoo. Get out of my room!

11:21.147 --> 11:25.311
We should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.884
Still broken?

11:35.595 --> 11:37.153
It sucks, man.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.194
Your last night, and I lose the two
most important things:

11:40.400 --> 11:42.561
The foosball table...

11:42.869 --> 11:44.598
and $500.

11:45.838 --> 11:49.569
There are other ways to win back
your money. How about blackjack?

11:49.842 --> 11:51.104
Not my game.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.902
You know what?
We can play a new game.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.444
-It's fun!
-What's it called?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.350
Cups.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.345
-I don't know how.
-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.422
-All right.
-Here you go.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.895
I have two queens.
What do you have?

12:10.396 --> 12:12.626
-A 2 and a 5.
-You win! Fifty dollars!

12:15.568 --> 12:17.365
-Really?
-Let's play again.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.438
-What have you got?
-4 and a 9.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.567
You're kidding, right?

12:26.813 --> 12:29.213
-No. Why?
-That's a full cup!

12:31.251 --> 12:33.378
Damn, I am good at Cups!

12:35.788 --> 12:37.278
I'm not talking to her.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.115
You have to take the first step...

12:40.393 --> 12:43.794
because she's the one who's
leaving. It's harder for her.

12:45.164 --> 12:46.324
Maybe you're right.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.999
But she made fun of my phone pen!

12:49.836 --> 12:51.963
I know. I took it hard too.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.665
She's in there right now, crying.
I can hear her.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.538
She's not crying.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.514
She's holding it in.
She's so brave. Go.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.620
I feel bad about what happened..

13:10.857 --> 13:13.348
-What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.388
I'm not moving.
Is that picture straight?

13:17.664 --> 13:20.462
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

13:20.733 --> 13:24.669
You're the one who wants this
big change and to move in with Chandler!

13:24.904 --> 13:26.895
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?

13:27.173 --> 13:30.870
-It's my apartment!
-It's mine too! What else you got?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.737
How about: You're moving!

13:44.557 --> 13:45.922
This is ridiculous.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.657
We should be packing you!

13:51.497 --> 13:54.523
-Hey, how you guys doing?
-Great. Monica's moving.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.093
I am not!

13:57.403 --> 14:00.372
Really? How come all your
stuff is in this box?

14:00.606 --> 14:04.201
Okay, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here!

14:04.777 --> 14:06.677
You guys? Stop!

14:07.447 --> 14:12.043
I know you're acting mad because
it'll make it easier to leave.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.345
But deep down, you're really sad.
Deep, deep down.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.749
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!

14:18.024 --> 14:19.218
I'm just mad.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.351
Then keep running.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.853
You win!

14:26.099 --> 14:28.124
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats...

14:28.768 --> 14:30.633
a three and a six.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.531
That, my friend, is "D Cup."

14:35.708 --> 14:38.108
How much have you won so far?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.740
-700.
-Not 700 exactly?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.244
Double it.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.882
In Cups, once you get $700,
you have to double it.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.625
I didn't make up the rules.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.630
Now, after you receive the doubling
bonus, you get one card.

14:59.899 --> 15:04.495
That one card could be worth $100,
which brings your total to $1500.

15:06.005 --> 15:10.465
Don't get excited, that won't happen
unless you get the.. No way!

15:13.579 --> 15:15.638
This is the last box of your clothes.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.840
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

15:20.286 --> 15:23.847
I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.290
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...

15:29.529 --> 15:31.861
I don't wanna live with
Rachel anymore.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.630
You're so mean to each other.

15:34.834 --> 15:38.099
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.602
That's fine because I'm not moving.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.637
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.039
I said some bad stuff...

15:47.280 --> 15:50.340
but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.015
Like what, Monica?

15:55.188 --> 15:57.554
She has 147,000 pair of boots.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.451
Good start, Mon.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.184
She lets you borrow them.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.563
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.896
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold!

16:11.804 --> 16:16.673
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.132
What else?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.575
When I take a shower...

16:22.048 --> 16:24.073
she leaves me notes on the mirror.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.544
I do. I do do that.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.753
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.527
When I fall asleep on the couch...

16:36.896 --> 16:38.693
she covers me with a blanket.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.760
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.901
And when I told her I was gonna
move in with Chandler...

16:50.176 --> 16:51.939
she was really supportive.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.408
You were so great.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.080
You made it so easy.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.252
And now you have to leave.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.225
And I have to live with a boy!

17:10.263 --> 17:12.288
It's gonna be fine.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.859
Now I can't wait to live with you!

17:16.736 --> 17:17.862
You know what we should do?

17:18.104 --> 17:22.063
Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
We'll have so much fun!

17:23.809 --> 17:25.902
I think she's moving in with Chandler.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.308
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.441
Kind of.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.752
Oh, my God!

17:45.264 --> 17:47.164
How's the packing going?

17:47.767 --> 17:51.259
Ben? He's fine. He's right..
Oh, my God!

17:52.772 --> 17:56.003
Get your head out of your shirt
there, son!

17:57.977 --> 18:00.969
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.919
-What's wrong?
-Ross and I were helping pack...

18:08.120 --> 18:12.022
took a little break.
I lost $1500 to him in Cups!

18:14.293 --> 18:16.318
How did you lose at Cups?

18:16.862 --> 18:18.193
The same way you lost!

18:18.464 --> 18:22.924
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.

18:23.502 --> 18:26.869
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.271
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup...

18:30.543 --> 18:35.674
the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
even get half a cup! Nothing!

18:36.482 --> 18:37.608
Oh, man!

18:38.384 --> 18:40.375
He never played before either.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.952
I think beginner's luck
is very important in Cups!

18:45.291 --> 18:47.452
Let's play one more hand.
One more hand.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.152
No more! I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.864
In fact, look.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.895
I wanna give you something.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.965
Let me give it to you before
I pawn it for Cups money.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.835
I want you to have
the big, white dog...

19:05.144 --> 19:08.841
as a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.414
I can't take the big white dog.
You love it.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.086
It's "him." Not "it."

19:16.022 --> 19:18.616
What if I bought it from you?

19:18.824 --> 19:22.055
Then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.023
Say $1500?

19:25.898 --> 19:29.356
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.930
You're trying to give me money again!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.071
When did I try to give you money?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.103
Over there with the bills!

19:36.342 --> 19:39.334
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.409
We had a nice last night together.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.208
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.186
Now you start with the
charity thing again!

19:50.423 --> 19:54.223
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.452
I will be okay.

19:56.729 --> 20:00.631
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.028
I'm not gonna miss you helping me
out with money.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.569
The only thing I'm gonna miss...

20:08.107 --> 20:09.574
is you.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.801
And now the dog.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.149
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.051
I'm really gonna miss you.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.131
I have your key.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.230
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.070
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.081
Bye, house.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.977
-She really left.
-I know.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.949
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.467
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.398
What the hell is that dog doing here?

21:50.075 --> 21:53.374
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

21:53.612 --> 21:57.070
-And now you want that money back?
-Exactly.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.614
What kind of idiot do you
take me for?

22:00.886 --> 22:02.945
It's not a real game.
I made it up.

22:03.222 --> 22:06.316
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.924
At a fake game!

22:08.928 --> 22:11.624
If you wanna try to
make some of it back...

22:11.831 --> 22:14.994
I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.431
I am very good at Cups.

22:20.139 --> 22:23.267
I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.977
Let's see if it comes up this time.
