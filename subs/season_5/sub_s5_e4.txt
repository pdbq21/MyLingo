WEBVTT

00:08.858 --> 00:10.189
Come in.

00:10.694 --> 00:13.219
I've been waiting for you.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.491
Hi, I just

00:18.735 --> 00:20.532
Oh, my God!
Monica!

00:20.770 --> 00:22.237
Oh, my God!

00:22.439 --> 00:24.031
I'm sorry! I was

00:24.574 --> 00:26.007
I was taking a nap.

00:26.242 --> 00:29.336
Since when do you
take naps in that position?

00:31.548 --> 00:34.881
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.

00:35.085 --> 00:37.110
Yes, I was.
A guy.

00:37.921 --> 00:39.855
From work.

00:40.090 --> 00:42.217
I'm seeing a guy from work!

00:44.728 --> 00:48.858
That cute waiter guy that looks like
a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?

00:50.366 --> 00:51.856
That one!

00:52.102 --> 00:55.731
Give me a second.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.

00:55.939 --> 00:59.875
When I get back,
I want every little detail.

01:02.912 --> 01:04.777
Maybe that's him.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.743
It's just Joey and Ross.

01:11.221 --> 01:12.620
Why aren't you at the movie?

01:12.889 --> 01:16.256
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.

01:16.459 --> 01:19.826
I had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!

01:22.065 --> 01:25.762
-He's talking to London.
-Did he get in touch with Emily?

01:25.969 --> 01:30.906
No, not yet. He's hoping that someone
will help him get in touch with her.

01:31.107 --> 01:35.806
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!

01:37.781 --> 01:40.011
Way to suck up to the family!

01:47.357 --> 01:52.454
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

01:55.331 --> 01:57.128
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS

02:42.779 --> 02:47.910
Hi, is this Nanny Hopkins?
I'm looking for Emily.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.210
Waltham.

02:49.819 --> 02:55.485
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this 0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2...

02:55.658 --> 03:00.721
...9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7?

03:02.065 --> 03:04.499
Oh, it's "4-3," not 4-2.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.329
Well, which 4-2?

03:10.039 --> 03:12.030
No, no! Vomit tux!

03:13.042 --> 03:15.067
Don't worry,
I had it dry-cleaned.

03:15.245 --> 03:16.234
Vomit tux?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.745
Who vomited on?

03:19.048 --> 03:21.744
You know what?
What you up to, Joe?

03:22.252 --> 03:24.880
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.

03:25.154 --> 03:27.645
And my agent
got me a job as cohost!

03:27.857 --> 03:29.347
That's great!

03:29.592 --> 03:33.494
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.

03:33.763 --> 03:36.561
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.534
Oh, PBS!

03:40.436 --> 03:43.234
-What's wrong with PBS?
-What's right with them?

03:44.774 --> 03:46.503
Why don't you like PBS?

03:46.709 --> 03:51.840
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in a bad place, personally.

03:54.384 --> 03:57.012
I thought I'd write
to Sesame Street.

03:57.220 --> 04:00.189
Because they were nice
when I was a little kid.

04:00.423 --> 04:02.084
No one ever wrote back.

04:02.292 --> 04:05.125
A lot of those muppets
don't have thumbs.

04:07.230 --> 04:11.360
All I got was a lousy key chain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.262
I didn't have keys!

04:14.437 --> 04:15.631
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

04:15.905 --> 04:19.204
I wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.

04:19.542 --> 04:23.740
This isn't a good deed. You just
want to get on TV. This is selfish.

04:23.947 --> 04:27.940
What about you having
those babies for your brother?

04:28.151 --> 04:29.743
That's selfish!

04:31.654 --> 04:33.451
What are you talking about?

04:33.656 --> 04:36.887
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?

04:37.126 --> 04:38.320
Yeah, so?

04:38.561 --> 04:41.223
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.

04:41.464 --> 04:44.900
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

04:45.101 --> 04:48.832
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!

04:49.072 --> 04:50.903
May I ask for one example?

04:51.107 --> 04:53.974
Yeah, it's
You know, there's

04:54.177 --> 04:55.940
No, you may not!

04:57.680 --> 04:59.807
Because all people are selfish.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.983
Are you calling me selfish?

05:02.251 --> 05:04.583
Are you calling you people?

05:06.990 --> 05:11.859
Sorry to burst that bubble, Phoebe,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.

05:12.328 --> 05:14.125
You know the deal
on Santa Claus?

05:15.031 --> 05:20.162
I'll find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

05:26.876 --> 05:29.106
Oh, my God! It's Emily!

05:29.345 --> 05:31.336
It's Emily, everyone!

05:34.851 --> 05:38.514
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

05:38.721 --> 05:42.555
You can hang up, but I'll keep calling
everyone in England...

05:42.825 --> 05:46.556
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.

05:47.230 --> 05:48.458
Really? About what?

05:48.664 --> 05:51.531
Look, you're my wife.
We're married.

05:51.734 --> 05:53.292
You know, I love you.

05:53.503 --> 05:55.630
I really miss you.

05:57.306 --> 05:58.671
I miss you too.

05:59.409 --> 06:01.036
At least, I think I do.

06:01.577 --> 06:03.374
She's talking.

06:08.684 --> 06:11.551
When you said "the deal with Santa,"
you meant...?

06:11.754 --> 06:13.244
That he doesn't exist.

06:13.489 --> 06:14.717
Right.

06:19.595 --> 06:22.996
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?

06:24.600 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

06:27.904 --> 06:32.102
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?

06:32.675 --> 06:35.508
I don't think he's
up to meeting everyone yet.

06:35.745 --> 06:38.213
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.

06:38.714 --> 06:42.673
I want to meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.182
Really?

06:47.223 --> 06:49.589
That's what you heard?
You said that?

06:50.059 --> 06:51.253
I might have.

06:54.530 --> 06:55.929
Why is that funny?

06:56.866 --> 06:59.198
Because I'm very happy for him.

06:59.769 --> 07:02.067
And you!
You lucky dog!

07:06.442 --> 07:08.876
She's willing to work
on the relationship.

07:09.312 --> 07:10.301
That's great!

07:10.580 --> 07:11.569
In London.

07:12.281 --> 07:14.647
She wants me to move to London.

07:14.884 --> 07:15.908
But you live here.

07:19.322 --> 07:20.584
You know that.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.593
-What will you do?
-I don't know.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.355
-I mean, I can't leave Ben.
-You can just video-conference with him.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.731
I'm not ready to have a child.

07:34.270 --> 07:36.795
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...

07:37.106 --> 07:40.872
...I could convince them
to move to London with Ben.

07:41.110 --> 07:43.874
I'm sure your ex-wife
would be more than happy to move...

07:44.080 --> 07:46.878
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.

07:49.252 --> 07:50.947
It could happen.

07:53.422 --> 07:57.859
Ross, we are not moving to London.
We already have lives here.

07:58.027 --> 08:01.258
But it'd be great.
They have great theater...

08:01.430 --> 08:04.126
...great accents.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.029
Tea.

08:07.970 --> 08:09.904
They have a queen.

08:11.107 --> 08:13.302
-So?
-She's a woman.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.078
-Daddy!
-Hey!

08:19.248 --> 08:22.684
Guess what? We're moving to London!

08:23.653 --> 08:26.349
-Who's going to London?
-Nobody's going to London.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.217
Welcome to London, governor.

08:29.825 --> 08:33.420
Right, right. It'll be great
because we'll have Big Ben and little Ben...

08:33.596 --> 08:35.791
...in the same city.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.531
Go pack!

08:39.068 --> 08:41.696
See? See, he wants to go.

08:41.871 --> 08:45.466
Yeah, we leave all our big decisions
to the 3-year-old.

08:46.342 --> 08:49.573
Come on, come on.
It'll be just like Three's Company...

08:49.745 --> 08:52.839
...only there's a kid and my wife...

08:53.015 --> 08:56.143
...and you're the gay ones.

09:01.224 --> 09:03.624
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.

09:05.061 --> 09:06.460
This'll be your phone.

09:10.533 --> 09:11.761
That's great.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.935
But I'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.

09:15.605 --> 09:17.630
No, you answer it
and take pledges.

09:18.207 --> 09:19.265
But I'm the host.

09:19.542 --> 09:23.034
Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.439
You don't seem to understand.
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

09:28.784 --> 09:31.150
Well, here's your phone, doctor.

09:33.956 --> 09:36.789
I can't believe I can't find
a selfless good deed.

09:37.059 --> 09:39.391
You know that old guy
that lives next to me?

09:39.629 --> 09:42.962
I snuck over there and raked up
the leaves on his front stoop.

09:43.232 --> 09:47.259
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.436
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!

09:53.175 --> 09:56.611
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.304
I will find a selfless good deed.
I gave birth to three children...

10:00.583 --> 10:04.314
...and I won't let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!

10:07.023 --> 10:09.514
Can I ask you a cooking question?

10:09.759 --> 10:11.659
If you're cooking on the stove...

10:11.927 --> 10:15.795
...that means your new boyfriend
is better in bed than Richard?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.298
Is he?

10:23.272 --> 10:27.504
I think I'll respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.

10:27.843 --> 10:29.105
Why?

10:31.547 --> 10:32.878
If this guy was me...

10:33.149 --> 10:37.381
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...

10:37.653 --> 10:38.950
...I'd be like this:

10:49.231 --> 10:50.220
All right, Emily.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.361
As much as I love you...

10:52.635 --> 10:55.968
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.

10:56.539 --> 10:59.030
I understand that would be difficult.

10:59.241 --> 11:03.007
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.

11:03.212 --> 11:05.146
Why can't you just do that?

11:05.715 --> 11:07.649
I don't know. It's just

11:09.819 --> 11:14.722
But I know that even though I've been
a complete idiot up till now...

11:14.990 --> 11:16.685
...you have to come here.

11:17.159 --> 11:20.026
You have to, so we can
work this out together.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.325
All right.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.059
Did you just say "all right"?

11:25.267 --> 11:27.827
I did.
Now I'm the idiot.

11:28.037 --> 11:30.164
Emily, that is so great!

11:30.373 --> 11:31.533
It'll be great!

11:31.741 --> 11:35.700
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!

11:39.415 --> 11:42.282
There's one thing that
really scares me still.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.849
-Yes, tell me.
-You must understand...

11:45.087 --> 11:47.954
...how humiliating it was
for me at the altar...

11:48.190 --> 11:50.351
...in front of my family and friends.

11:50.693 --> 11:53.526
I know. I am so sorry.

11:53.729 --> 11:57.563
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...

11:57.800 --> 12:01.133
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.

12:01.737 --> 12:04.262
Again, very sorry.

12:06.208 --> 12:09.143
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.

12:09.412 --> 12:12.973
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.

12:13.949 --> 12:17.441
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.

12:19.255 --> 12:20.950
I love you.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.824
All right.

12:24.393 --> 12:27.988
I'll come to New York,
and we'll try to make this work.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.589
That's so great!

12:29.799 --> 12:33.428
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.

12:41.243 --> 12:44.576
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.405
And she said yes.

12:46.782 --> 12:47.771
Great!

12:50.152 --> 12:53.315
Only if I promise
never to see Rachel again.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.989
What? You can't

12:55.191 --> 12:56.249
What did you say?

12:56.492 --> 13:01.020
I'd think about it. How am l
supposed to make this decision?

13:03.098 --> 13:05.328
I'm actually asking you!

13:07.002 --> 13:10.096
Rachel is one of your best friends.

13:12.007 --> 13:13.668
But Emily's his wife!

13:13.876 --> 13:15.138
That's true!

13:17.213 --> 13:20.148
You can't just cut Rachel
out of your life!

13:20.382 --> 13:22.179
That's true!

13:23.686 --> 13:25.984
Thanks for the help.
Problem solved!

13:34.330 --> 13:36.195
When will you be on TV?

13:36.999 --> 13:39.968
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...

13:40.202 --> 13:42.636
...but I'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.138
You're not on TV.

13:49.044 --> 13:50.671
How about now?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.739
There he is!

13:54.984 --> 13:56.815
Hello, New York!

13:58.754 --> 14:02.155
Maybe just put the whole duck in there.
Who cares?

14:02.358 --> 14:03.882
Now I got the legs.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.697
How many times have I told you
to never watch the cooking channel?

14:15.437 --> 14:18.406
I need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed.

14:18.741 --> 14:20.231
That was yours?

14:20.576 --> 14:24.512
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.

14:25.414 --> 14:28.110
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.

14:28.350 --> 14:29.908
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

14:33.255 --> 14:36.224
Joey's at the telethon
for the rest of the day.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.358
We have the place to ourselves.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.028
Yeah, so?

14:40.229 --> 14:44.962
Maybe you'd want to book some time
with "the best you've ever had."

14:46.368 --> 14:48.233
You know what, champ?

14:48.470 --> 14:49.732
I think I'll pass.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.028
Why?

15:05.821 --> 15:07.288
What's your point?

15:09.058 --> 15:11.686
With all the stupid gloating,
would you want to sleep with you?

15:11.860 --> 15:15.261
Well, I think I'd be a little out of my league,
but I'd give it a shot.

15:19.702 --> 15:21.294
PBS Telethon.

15:22.738 --> 15:27.072
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.

15:27.309 --> 15:30.142
I went down to the park
and I let a bee sting me.

15:31.246 --> 15:33.441
What good is that going to do?

15:33.649 --> 15:37.278
It helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.

15:37.987 --> 15:40.717
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.

15:41.056 --> 15:44.617
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.

15:49.632 --> 15:50.826
Damn it!

15:52.901 --> 15:55.096
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

16:02.311 --> 16:05.246
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?

16:05.481 --> 16:07.506
No way.
I'm in the shot, man.

16:08.484 --> 16:11.476
-You've been here all day!
-I'm taking pledges.

16:11.787 --> 16:14.187
And we're on three, two....

16:15.024 --> 16:16.992
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

16:17.192 --> 16:20.025
If you've been enjoying
Cirque du Soleil...

16:20.262 --> 16:24.198
...and you'd like to see more,
it's very simple.

16:24.466 --> 16:27.458
All you have to do
is call in a pledge...

16:27.703 --> 16:32.766
...and tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you

16:36.111 --> 16:39.308
-Quick broiling pan question
-Yes, it really does cost that much.

16:39.481 --> 16:42.644
Maybe next time your duck can puke
in something from Pottery Barn.

16:46.155 --> 16:50.091
That's it. I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.

16:50.392 --> 16:53.486
I leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.

16:56.331 --> 16:57.662
A Magic 8 Ball?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.595
You can't make this decision
with a toy!

17:00.803 --> 17:02.771
It's not a toy.

17:04.339 --> 17:06.739
I don't know what else to do!

17:06.975 --> 17:11.241
I either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...

17:11.480 --> 17:15.280
...or I get divorced
for the second time before I'm 30.

17:15.484 --> 17:18.851
If anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.453
Because I got nothing!
Don't be shy.

17:21.690 --> 17:23.954
Any suggestion will do.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.023
Okay, then.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.827
Here we go.

17:37.206 --> 17:38.764
Magic 8 Ball...

17:39.007 --> 17:41.771
...should I never see Rachel again?

17:45.547 --> 17:46.673
"Ask Again Later."

17:49.051 --> 17:51.542
Later is not good enough!

17:57.826 --> 17:58.815
"Ask Again Later."

17:59.061 --> 18:00.187
What the hell?

18:00.395 --> 18:02.727
This is broken! It is broken!

18:04.066 --> 18:05.658
Let me see.

18:06.702 --> 18:09.193
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

18:10.038 --> 18:11.232
"Don't Count On lt."

18:15.811 --> 18:17.802
Seems like it works to me.

18:18.781 --> 18:21.249
Okay, one more time.

18:22.317 --> 18:25.411
Should I never see Rachel again?

18:27.589 --> 18:30.387
Magic 8 Ball! What did you ask?

18:34.263 --> 18:35.753
Does...

18:35.931 --> 18:40.300
...Rachel get to pick the movie
that we're all going to see tonight?

18:40.469 --> 18:42.630
Excellent. What's the answer?

18:45.140 --> 18:47.938
Looks like Stella's gonna get
her groove back tonight!

18:51.013 --> 18:52.913
What? I heard it was good.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.913
PBS Telethon.

18:58.086 --> 18:59.075
Hi, Joey.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.377
Hey, Phoebe.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.079
I'd like
to make a pledge.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.359
I would like to donate $200.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.754
Two hundred dollars?

19:06.061 --> 19:08.825
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?

19:09.031 --> 19:11.499
I'm still mad at them,
but they bring happiness...

19:11.733 --> 19:15.191
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.

19:17.039 --> 19:21.999
By supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.

19:22.277 --> 19:24.802
So there!
A selfless good deed.

19:25.013 --> 19:27.675
You don't feel good
about donating the money?

19:27.883 --> 19:31.375
No, it sucks!
I was saving up to buy a hamster.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.681
A hamster?
Those things are, like, $10.

19:34.890 --> 19:37.120
Not the one I had my eye on.

19:37.693 --> 19:41.629
It looks like we have surpassed
last year's pledge total.

19:41.897 --> 19:42.886
Thank you!

19:43.765 --> 19:48.702
And the pledge that did it
was taken by one of our volunteers.

19:48.937 --> 19:54.102
Oh, boy! And may I say,
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.

19:54.977 --> 19:57.104
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!

19:57.312 --> 19:58.404
Oh, look!

19:58.614 --> 20:00.241
Joey's on TV!

20:00.449 --> 20:01.711
Isn't that great?

20:01.917 --> 20:05.546
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so

20:05.754 --> 20:06.982
Oh, no!

20:14.263 --> 20:15.252
Look...

20:15.464 --> 20:19.730
...I got carried away before,
but there's something you got to know.

20:19.935 --> 20:24.429
If I'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.

20:26.441 --> 20:27.908
Keep talking.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.638
I was nothing before you.

20:30.913 --> 20:33.108
Call the other girls and ask.

20:34.016 --> 20:36.007
Which wouldn't take long.

20:37.019 --> 20:40.318
But when I'm with you,
and we're together...

20:40.589 --> 20:43.183
...oh, my God!

20:48.297 --> 20:51.027
-Really?
-Oh, my God!

20:54.269 --> 20:58.171
I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.203
But that would be wrong.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.935
We're too good.

21:03.312 --> 21:05.780
We owe it to sex!

21:08.116 --> 21:09.140
If we owe it!

21:12.788 --> 21:13.982
Oh, my!

21:15.791 --> 21:17.019
When will Joey be home?

21:17.392 --> 21:20.020
I was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.

21:21.997 --> 21:24.795
No, no, no!
Leave the gloves on.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.967
I cleaned the bathroom.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.397
Why don't we lose the gloves.

21:33.075 --> 21:36.067
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.171
-You know that wasn't part of it?
-I know.

21:56.531 --> 21:58.897
You ready?
We're going to be late.

21:59.167 --> 22:02.068
-For what?
-For Stella, remember?

22:02.337 --> 22:05.067
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.

22:06.608 --> 22:09.202
I totally forgot about that.

22:10.112 --> 22:13.673
Can I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.545
Sure, I guess.

22:16.952 --> 22:19.443
I hear you don't have to
go to London.

22:21.790 --> 22:26.523
It's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.

22:27.062 --> 22:28.086
Like what?

22:28.363 --> 22:29.887
Just stuff.

22:30.098 --> 22:33.864
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

22:34.569 --> 22:36.594
Talk to me.
Maybe I can help.

22:39.374 --> 22:40.932
You can't help.

22:44.079 --> 22:46.479
I have to do this
without your help.

22:49.384 --> 22:53.650
I know you can do that too.
I'm just saying if you need to talk....

22:57.659 --> 22:58.921
Thanks.

23:03.432 --> 23:06.230
Whatever it is that Emily wants...

23:06.435 --> 23:08.403
...just give it to her.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.071
The bottom line is that you love her.

23:11.273 --> 23:13.434
Fix whatever she wants fixed.

23:14.109 --> 23:15.508
Just do it.

23:17.345 --> 23:21.475
You're going to have to try.
You'll hate yourself if you don't.

23:25.187 --> 23:26.620
Come on, answer it!

23:30.525 --> 23:32.015
Hi, sweetie.

23:32.861 --> 23:33.850
Good.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.165
Yes, I've been thinking...

23:40.435 --> 23:44.371
...about that thing
you wanted me to do.

23:45.874 --> 23:46.932
I can do it.

23:49.444 --> 23:51.844
Will you come to New York?

24:33.688 --> 24:35.679
-Never done that before.
-Nope.
