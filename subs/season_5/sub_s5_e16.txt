WEBVTT

00:10.643 --> 00:14.010
-What are you guys doing up?
-Finishing the crossword.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.745
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

00:18.918 --> 00:20.010
Dark red.

00:21.821 --> 00:25.655
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
in here for you later.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.024
Hey, how about maroon?

00:30.296 --> 00:32.526
Yes! You are so smart!

00:34.534 --> 00:35.865
You guys are so cute.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.125
I know.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.030
See you in the morning.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.951
I love doing crossword
puzzles with you.

00:57.123 --> 00:58.112
Me too.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.691
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.458
Only one left.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.165
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but....

01:07.367 --> 01:08.629
Cat.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.466
You are so smart!

01:16.042 --> 01:17.031
I love you.

01:17.343 --> 01:18.708
I love you too.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.789
The One with the Cop

02:23.343 --> 02:24.708
We still need a tip.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.345
All right. Hold on.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.945
I got it.

02:29.849 --> 02:30.907
Nickel.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.419
-How much do we need?
-Couple of bucks.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.180
Okay, dime.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.415
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.

02:40.693 --> 02:41.853
Wait, look it!

02:43.630 --> 02:45.564
This is a police badge!

02:45.765 --> 02:49.792
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.

02:52.038 --> 02:55.872
Could you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.

02:57.143 --> 02:59.202
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

02:59.479 --> 03:02.710
I should take it back.
But at the police station...

03:02.949 --> 03:04.883
...I'll check their 10 Most Wanted List.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.884
My friend's been number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

03:11.124 --> 03:13.786
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey, Joey.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.663
Is that my sweatshirt?

03:18.898 --> 03:22.231
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

03:22.468 --> 03:25.995
It's just that if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

03:26.272 --> 03:28.467
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

03:28.741 --> 03:30.106
And I'm not him.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.812
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.175
It's gonna be all
smelling like Monica.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.279
Do I smell bad?

03:40.353 --> 03:42.913
You smell like a meadow.

03:45.191 --> 03:46.180
I'm sorry.

03:49.495 --> 03:50.519
What's with him?

03:50.797 --> 03:55.131
The last time Joey went to a meadow
his mother was shot by a hunter.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.402
Look what I found.
It's a police badge.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.839
What's that doing here?
I don't see any doughnuts.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.675
Cops and doughnuts.
Come on.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.644
If Chandler had said it
you'd all be on the floor.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.285
Cops, doughnuts? Me?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.233
I still don't know.

04:35.408 --> 04:39.344
I want to make sure I bought
the right couch, one that says...

04:39.579 --> 04:43.879
..."Kids welcome here,"
but that also says...

04:44.150 --> 04:45.583
..."Come here to me."

04:48.588 --> 04:51.489
What? You say that to kids?

04:53.660 --> 04:58.188
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

04:59.065 --> 05:02.159
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
it's not a magic couch.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.569
Well, you picked a great couch.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.397
-Sign here, please.
-Sure.

05:09.542 --> 05:13.535
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

05:13.780 --> 05:16.749
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.849
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.214
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.726
Are you kidding?

05:31.564 --> 05:35.694
Come on. It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy. Try it.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.940
Oh, I can do it.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.936
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.874
We're not together.

05:50.216 --> 05:52.912
Something didn't quite add up there.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.056
What's that supposed to mean?

06:02.562 --> 06:04.928
Well, you. Her.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.928
I mean, she's very...

06:07.166 --> 06:08.394
...you know.

06:08.668 --> 06:09.999
And you're, like...

06:10.636 --> 06:11.625
...you know?

06:14.841 --> 06:18.641
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.243
Really? You two?

06:21.514 --> 06:24.972
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.515
Then tell him quickly.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.951
Fine. We went out.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.453
Not only did we go out...

06:32.759 --> 06:35.592
...we did it 298 times!

06:39.799 --> 06:43.530
You kept count?
You are such a loser!

06:44.670 --> 06:48.538
A loser you did it with 298 times!

06:55.047 --> 06:59.279
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.211
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.181
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.326
I won't. Till I have
my next cigarette.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.789
Hold it!

07:10.062 --> 07:11.962
N.Y.P.D. Freeze, punk!

07:13.966 --> 07:17.060
That's right. You are so busted.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.728
Book them.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.565
-Who are you talking to?
-Save it, red!

07:23.910 --> 07:27.812
Apologize to the tree or
spend the night in the slammer.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.882
I am not apologizing to a tree.

07:31.484 --> 07:35.079
You apologize to the tree right now
or I am calling for backup.

07:37.523 --> 07:38.717
Backup! Backup!

07:39.025 --> 07:40.652
I'm sorry! Sorry!

07:40.860 --> 07:43.920
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

07:46.866 --> 07:50.029
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?

07:50.236 --> 07:53.000
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

07:54.106 --> 07:57.473
Don't you think we should rethink
the whole hiring movers thing?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.338
No way. They're a rip-off.

07:59.512 --> 08:03.209
They check out your stuff
and come back later and steal it.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.647
It's true. I saw it on Dateline.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.617
Jane Pauley is the one woman
I would kiss.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.717
-There's just something about her.
-Rach, can we concentrate?

08:15.628 --> 08:19.257
Yeah, fine.
I listened to your dumb story.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.195
Okay, go left.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.026
Left. Left.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.033
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.939
Lift it straight up over your head.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.371
Straight up. You can do it!

08:32.645 --> 08:33.942
You can do it!

08:34.146 --> 08:35.704
Okay. You got it?

08:35.982 --> 08:37.472
-Go, go.
-Good, good.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.777
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got

08:45.625 --> 08:48.458
Any chance you think
it looks good there?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.491
This guy was all:

08:52.698 --> 08:54.859
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

08:56.669 --> 08:58.330
It was just so cool!

08:58.871 --> 09:03.638
-You were supposed to take it back.
-I'm having fun doing good deeds.

09:04.176 --> 09:07.475
You can get arrested
for impersonating a police officer.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.174
You could get arrested
right now!

09:13.152 --> 09:16.713
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.225
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys would be here.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.064
-Do me a favor. Taste this.
-What? Why?

09:34.040 --> 09:36.634
It's okay, Joe, she's a trained chef.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.002
Actually, I was looking for Phoebe.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.908
Well, you just missed her.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.409
Was that her?

09:46.953 --> 09:49.183
-I gotta go.
-Joey, wait a minute. Wait.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.788
-What is with you?
-Nothing.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.619
You're acting strange.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.186
All right. There is something.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.363
I kind of had a dream.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.463
But I don't want to talk about it.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.567
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

10:08.307 --> 10:10.832
I kind of have a dream.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.970
I don't want to talk about it.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.046
Look, it involved Monica.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.048
You had a dream about the girl I'm seeing?
Cool.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.515
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.021
Let's talk about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

10:27.860 --> 10:30.988
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that...

10:31.230 --> 10:33.892
...since I found out
about you two. More or less.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.763
What was the dream about?

10:43.075 --> 10:46.670
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.709
Like you did last night.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.111
That's it. I'm in love
with Monica. I'll move out.

10:52.418 --> 10:56.081
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.

10:56.856 --> 10:57.880
It doesn't?

10:58.090 --> 10:59.785
It could mean anything.
Like...

11:00.059 --> 11:03.460
...you're jealous that I've become
the apartment stud.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.092
Sounds like your dream.

11:08.801 --> 11:13.761
Or it could mean you saw Chandler
and me being close and stuff...

11:14.040 --> 11:15.803
...and you want that too.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.938
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.775
If that's what it was, that'd be great.
I wouldn't have to move.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.308
Are you attracted to Monica?

11:26.585 --> 11:30.248
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

11:32.491 --> 11:34.516
-Not really.
-There you have it!

11:34.794 --> 11:38.195
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

11:39.665 --> 11:40.791
But that's good!

11:41.000 --> 11:44.128
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.930
It's not just about
getting a girlfriend.

11:47.173 --> 11:51.769
I could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.844
But could we have
the closeness like you have?

11:55.347 --> 11:59.306
Monica and I were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.520
Friends first?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.279
That's interesting.

12:04.490 --> 12:08.187
-You become friends after?
-No, never done that either.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.692
Do you guys have a tape measure?

12:11.897 --> 12:14.229
Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.134
That's right.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.640
What's up, Joey?

12:34.353 --> 12:35.980
How you doing?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.998
Excuse me. Is this your car?

12:47.266 --> 12:50.394
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

12:50.669 --> 12:52.569
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

12:52.772 --> 12:57.675
It's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you, because I'm a cop.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.410
So am l.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.714
Okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.914
I know, because I'm a cop too.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.557
Keep up the good work. 10-4.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.559
Wait. So, what precinct are you with?

13:19.098 --> 13:21.293
I'm with the 57th.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.866
-I know a guy in Homicide up there.
-I'm in Vice.

13:25.104 --> 13:28.562
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.638
Who else is in Vice there?

13:33.379 --> 13:34.641
Do you know...

13:34.914 --> 13:36.108
...Sipowicz?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.973
Sipowicz? I don't think so.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.311
Yeah. Sipowicz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.620
I don't know him.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.124
Don't try to call him.
He's not there. He's out.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.920
His partner just died.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.896
Tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry
for his loss.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.592
I sure will. Take care.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.432
By the way, I'm sure
Sipowicz will be all right.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.575
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.409
Where'd you find my badge?

14:19.992 --> 14:23.484
Could you give me and Ross
a hand moving his couch?

14:23.662 --> 14:27.154
I'd love to, but I got acting class.
But you know what?

14:27.333 --> 14:30.496
I guess I could blow that off.
For you.

14:35.774 --> 14:40.108
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.212
Boy, they are really tight.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.437
I know.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.549
That's not a bad situation
they got there.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.053
Think I'll get me one of those.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.690
What's up, Joe?

14:55.461 --> 14:58.624
I think Monica and Chandler
are so great...

14:58.831 --> 15:01.391
...because they were friends first.

15:01.667 --> 15:05.967
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.503
I saw you first, so....

15:11.644 --> 15:16.138
-What are you saying?
-Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.577
You know, honey...

15:21.854 --> 15:24.152
...as flattered as I am...

15:24.390 --> 15:27.018
...that you saw me first...

15:27.826 --> 15:31.592
...I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.363
I'll treat you real nice.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.538
Yeah. Well, you know....

15:45.411 --> 15:50.371
I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

15:50.683 --> 15:54.744
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

15:54.954 --> 15:58.412
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.125
Don't hit on your existing friends.

16:02.928 --> 16:05.396
Won't that take longer?

16:08.067 --> 16:09.967
Oh, but once you find it...

16:10.235 --> 16:12.294
...it's so worth the wait.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.734
I understand.

16:15.941 --> 16:16.965
Good.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.537
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.275
Come here to me.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.584
No, no. You come here to me.

16:32.458 --> 16:36.155
-I brought reinforcements.
-Great! You brought Joey?

16:36.428 --> 16:37.793
The next best thing.

16:40.232 --> 16:44.100
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

16:45.237 --> 16:49.139
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so....

16:49.808 --> 16:52.276
I drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.412
Rach, that's you.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.672
That's the couch.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.915
What's that?

16:59.151 --> 17:00.641
That's me.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.288
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.962
No. That's my arm.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.432
I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.203
Just follow my lead.

17:26.812 --> 17:28.609
Come on, Chandler.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.446
-All right.
-Okay.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.150
Here we go.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.383
All right. Ready?

17:36.822 --> 17:37.846
Turn!

17:38.090 --> 17:39.079
Turn!

17:39.291 --> 17:40.383
Turn!

17:41.560 --> 17:45.690
-I don't think we can turn any more!
-I don't think it'll fit!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.332
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

17:49.201 --> 17:51.135
Up! Yes!

17:51.670 --> 17:53.001
Here we go! Pivot!

17:54.339 --> 17:55.397
Pivot!

17:57.176 --> 17:58.234
Pivot!

17:59.211 --> 18:00.200
Pivot!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.207
Pivot!

18:04.483 --> 18:05.472
Pivot!

18:05.684 --> 18:08.414
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

18:12.758 --> 18:15.192
I don't think it'll pivot any more.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.825
You think?

18:19.164 --> 18:22.930
All right, let's bring it
back down and try again.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.500
I think it's really stuck now.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.606
-I can't believe that didn't work.
-I know. Me neither.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.544
I mean, you had a sketch.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.089
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

18:51.663 --> 18:53.688
Man, I cannot figure this out.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.867
Yeah, because it's not 1985.

18:59.037 --> 19:02.495
You guys, guess what?
I ditched a cop.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.068
-What?
-What do you mean?

19:04.276 --> 19:07.006
He caught me using his badge
and he tried to bust me.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.647
Damn real cops!

19:10.015 --> 19:11.346
How far did he chase you?

19:11.517 --> 19:15.317
Well, he didn't really. He just picked up
his badge and stood there.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.684
Maybe we'll see you on
World's Most Boring Police Chases.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.490
-Why did you run?
-I had to.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.154
You know, impersonating a cop
is like a Class E felony.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.597
Two to four years minimum.
I am not going back to that hellhole.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.607
If I can just get it to pivot...

19:37.776 --> 19:39.869
...we'll be back on track.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.979
-Rach, can I get some help please?
-Yeah.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.580
Turn it off! Turn it off!

19:52.457 --> 19:56.325
Maybe the firemen can help us
move the couch when they get here.

19:57.129 --> 20:01.259
-Wait, wait, wait.
-It's a new couch! It's a new couch!

20:08.840 --> 20:11.434
How's it going?
Make any new friends?

20:11.677 --> 20:13.702
Yeah.
I met this woman.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.942
What's she like?

20:18.150 --> 20:19.640
Well, she's...

20:19.885 --> 20:21.284
...really good in bed.

20:23.055 --> 20:27.355
-You were going to be friends first.
-Hey, it's all your fault.

20:27.526 --> 20:28.515
Why?

20:28.694 --> 20:31.663
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

20:31.863 --> 20:35.697
I told her I wanted to build a foundation
and be friends first.

20:35.901 --> 20:40.702
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

20:41.807 --> 20:43.035
And her roommate.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.905
What about the closeness?

20:47.412 --> 20:51.712
Closeness, schmosness. There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

20:56.421 --> 20:57.979
Who wants pizza?

20:58.223 --> 20:59.656
I do! I do! I do!

21:00.392 --> 21:04.226
This is great! Can you believe
I found it on the second floor?

21:07.199 --> 21:09.167
-Who is it?
-N.Y.P.D.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.390
Oh, my God!

21:11.837 --> 21:13.429
Just a minute, officer!

21:23.248 --> 21:27.582
-I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
-My God, it's him! It's that cop!

21:27.853 --> 21:31.755
-I can't believe he found me!
-Are you gonna go to jail?

21:32.257 --> 21:35.124
If I go down,
you guys go down with me.

21:37.262 --> 21:40.720
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one to three years minimum.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.033
Good luck, Chandler.

21:46.471 --> 21:50.373
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.941
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

21:54.146 --> 21:56.979
And you understand that
I'm calling my lawyer.

21:57.215 --> 22:01.049
And once he puts you on the stand,
he'll make you look like a fool!

22:02.921 --> 22:04.786
I don't like looking foolish.

22:05.390 --> 22:09.417
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.822
I'd love it if I weren't here!

22:12.631 --> 22:16.624
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
I was wondering if you'd...

22:16.902 --> 22:19.063
...Iike to go to dinner with me?

22:19.805 --> 22:20.794
Me?

22:21.239 --> 22:25.073
Ever since you flashed my badge
I can't stop thinking about you.

22:25.344 --> 22:29.144
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

22:30.749 --> 22:31.943
Nice.

22:34.753 --> 22:38.189
I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

22:38.423 --> 22:41.859
I could've done it better,
but these people keep staring at me.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.186
I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.828
-Gary.
-Gary.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.001
Okay, so it's a date.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.829
I gotta ask you, though.
How'd you find me?

22:54.106 --> 22:57.007
I ran your fingerprints
through the computer.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.971
This was listed
as your last known address.

23:00.178 --> 23:01.202
Impressive.

23:01.446 --> 23:05.780
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.

23:06.518 --> 23:07.610
We'll talk at dinner.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.882
-So I'll come by and pick you up?
-I can't wait.

23:13.191 --> 23:16.024
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.729
He has a gun!

23:26.638 --> 23:30.301
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.672
You wanna return this couch?

23:39.151 --> 23:40.982
It's cut in half.

23:42.721 --> 23:46.987
-That's what I'm telling you.
-Did you cut this couch in half?

23:48.560 --> 23:51.427
It's crazy, it is cut in half.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.621
I don't understand.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.364
This couch is cut in half.

23:58.136 --> 24:02.266
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

24:04.075 --> 24:07.010
We can't accept it in this condition.

24:07.179 --> 24:11.115
Well, I can't accept it in this condition.

24:11.616 --> 24:15.177
You're saying this couch was
delivered to you like this?

24:15.387 --> 24:17.446
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.247
I will accept store credit.

24:21.593 --> 24:25.586
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of four dollars.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.726
I will take it.
