00:02.447 --> 00:05.974
-Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
-No, no, no.

00:06.218 --> 00:09.016
What are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

00:09.721 --> 00:11.348
We're pIaying a game
I Iearned.

00:11.590 --> 00:14.115
You have to name aII the states
in si<i>x</i> minutes.

00:14.359 --> 00:16.953
What? That's Iike insaneIy easy.

00:17.162 --> 00:19.756
It's harder than it sounds.
You aIways forget one.

00:19.998 --> 00:23.126
Or, in some cases, 1 4.

00:24.369 --> 00:28.863
It's stupid and I wasn't pIaying against
peopIe, so technicaIIy, I didn't Iose.

00:29.174 --> 00:31.108
You forgot 1 4 states?

00:31.343 --> 00:33.675
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

00:35.013 --> 00:36.503
Okay, time's up.

00:36.748 --> 00:38.113
AII right, I got 48.

00:38.317 --> 00:39.807
That's not bad. Pheebs?

00:40.018 --> 00:44.114
I got tired of naming states,
so I decided to Iist the types of ceIery.

00:46.158 --> 00:48.285
And I have one, reguIar ceIery.

00:49.361 --> 00:53.491
So RacheI's got 48,
and Phoebe has the Iead in...

00:54.633 --> 00:56.396
...vegetabIes. Joey?

00:56.802 --> 00:59.896
Say heIIo to the new champ
of ChandIer's dumb states game.

01:00.806 --> 01:04.139
-Wow, how many you got?
-Fifty-si<i>x</i>.

01:06.545 --> 01:08.740
The One Where ChandIer Doesn't Like Dogs

01:44.082 --> 01:46.346
Hey, how is New EngIand not a state?

01:46.852 --> 01:48.717
They have a sports team.

01:49.621 --> 01:51.851
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

01:54.192 --> 01:55.659
There you go.

01:57.663 --> 01:59.654
How come we have
one e<i>x</i>tra pIace setting?

01:59.965 --> 02:01.364
You invited your assistant.

02:01.633 --> 02:04.295
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

02:04.536 --> 02:07.369
His girIfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

02:07.606 --> 02:08.595
Why didn't you teII me?

02:08.840 --> 02:12.105
I made him his own individuaI
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

02:13.211 --> 02:15.406
I was going to,
but then I figured...

02:15.647 --> 02:18.878
...your food is so deIicious
and perfect...

02:19.151 --> 02:22.416
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

02:23.155 --> 02:27.717
You'd think I wouIdn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, but I stiII do.

02:29.561 --> 02:30.687
ReguIar ceIery!

02:30.929 --> 02:32.726
I aIready have that.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.389
Done...

02:36.668 --> 02:38.693
...with time to spare.

02:38.904 --> 02:43.568
-This may be a new worId's record.
-I hate to Iecture you guys...

02:43.842 --> 02:47.437
...but it's disgracefuI that
a group of weII-educated aduIts...

02:47.713 --> 02:52.343
...and Joey, can't name aII the states.

02:52.584 --> 02:57.954
You ever see a map, or one of those
round, coIorfuI things caIIed a ''gIobe''?

02:58.356 --> 03:02.224
MageIIan? You got 46 states.

03:02.427 --> 03:06.090
-What? That's impossibIe.
-Forty-si<i>x</i>.

03:06.364 --> 03:09.731
WeII, who's weII-educated now,
Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?

03:11.803 --> 03:13.794
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

03:14.039 --> 03:17.031
PIease, watch him.
Do not Iet Joey eat any of the food.

03:17.242 --> 03:18.903
I am onIy one man.

03:21.179 --> 03:23.704
-Okay, time is up.
-Now, just give me another minute.

03:23.915 --> 03:27.078
If you don't know them by now,
you wiII never know them, okay?

03:27.285 --> 03:31.312
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kiII yourseIf.

03:31.757 --> 03:33.816
This is crazy. I can do this.

03:34.092 --> 03:37.493
AII right, I bet I can get
aII 50 before dinner.

03:37.729 --> 03:39.959
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

03:40.198 --> 03:41.563
You're on.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.429
Don't Iook at my Iist, because there's
a Iot on there that you don't have.

03:48.273 --> 03:50.264
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

03:50.475 --> 03:53.342
The drawer fuII of takeout
menus is okay, right?

03:54.513 --> 03:55.844
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.512
ChandIer, give me a hand.

03:59.751 --> 04:04.950
Joey, do not Iet Ross Iook at maps
or the gIobe in your apartment.

04:05.157 --> 04:08.126
Don't worry.
It's not a gIobe of the United States.

04:15.834 --> 04:18.462
I'm gonna go out and take a waIk.

04:18.737 --> 04:20.967
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

04:21.173 --> 04:23.733
-Oh, it's not.
-SeriousIy, it's moving.

04:23.975 --> 04:27.433
-What the heII's in there?
-It's just my knitting. That's aII.

04:33.251 --> 04:35.344
Yes, I knit this.

04:36.888 --> 04:38.480
I'm very good.

04:43.295 --> 04:46.321
Ross' apartment is nice.
How come we don't hang out here?

04:46.565 --> 04:48.328
Maybe because it smeIIs a weird.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.797
It's Iike oId pumpkins or something.

04:51.303 --> 04:54.329
-That's my pie.
-Which smeIIs deIicious.

04:54.906 --> 04:56.840
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-What?

04:57.042 --> 04:59.010
We Ieft Joey aIone with the food.

05:00.045 --> 05:01.478
Yep, yep, I knew it.

05:01.713 --> 05:03.305
There he is...

05:03.515 --> 05:06.643
...feeding stuffing to a dog!

05:12.357 --> 05:15.190
Hi, GeIIer-Bing residence.
How can I heIp?

05:15.927 --> 05:17.986
Why is a dog in our apartment?

05:18.196 --> 05:19.993
I'm sorry, who's this?

05:21.199 --> 05:23.190
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

05:23.401 --> 05:26.495
TeII her I'm aIIergic, and I wiII sue!

05:29.040 --> 05:31.065
-There's no dog here.
-Yes, there is!

05:31.343 --> 05:33.436
He's bIack and white and shaggy.

05:33.678 --> 05:36.044
<i>He's sitting next to Rachel</i>
<i>and licking her hand.</i>

05:36.248 --> 05:38.739
Oh, my God! Where are you?

05:40.685 --> 05:42.516
I'II be right there.

05:43.622 --> 05:46.216
They're here aIready?
How are they doing this?!

05:52.230 --> 05:54.460
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

05:54.699 --> 05:57.896
I wanted to see if your offer
was stiII good.

05:58.103 --> 06:00.094
WeII, sure. Come in.

06:00.906 --> 06:02.965
WeII, what happened
to your girIfriend?

06:03.241 --> 06:05.436
We kind of broke up this morning.

06:05.644 --> 06:09.080
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.909
Ohio, thank you.

06:16.655 --> 06:18.088
Where's the dog?

06:18.290 --> 06:20.451
What dog? There's no dog here.

06:20.725 --> 06:22.750
Yeah, that dog Ieft.

06:27.699 --> 06:32.068
Wait a minute. I thought we agreed to say--
Your thing. Yeah.

06:32.604 --> 06:35.937
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

06:36.107 --> 06:38.701
There's no dog in here.

06:40.045 --> 06:43.811
WeII, the hiding-the-dog pIan
is off to a great start.

06:43.982 --> 06:46.678
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

06:46.851 --> 06:49.285
No, that's just me coughing.

06:54.459 --> 06:55.983
Oh, good. There you are.

06:56.227 --> 06:59.287
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

06:59.965 --> 07:01.364
What is it doing here?

07:01.599 --> 07:03.863
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

07:04.169 --> 07:05.329
Wait.

07:06.738 --> 07:09.502
HeIIo, my name is KIunkers.

07:10.308 --> 07:12.833
May I pIease stay
with you nice peopIe?

07:14.312 --> 07:17.213
I wish he couId stay here,
but ChandIer's aIIergic.

07:17.415 --> 07:19.212
E<i>x</i>tremeIy aIIergic, okay?

07:19.484 --> 07:22.647
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

07:22.887 --> 07:25.481
...my throat wiII just cIose up.

07:25.690 --> 07:29.217
That's odd. This dog's been
Iiving here for the past three days.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.630
ReaIIy?

07:38.169 --> 07:39.659
If he's been here
that Iong...

07:39.904 --> 07:43.237
...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe
you're not aIIergic to it.

07:43.441 --> 07:45.033
It stiII has to go, right?

07:45.243 --> 07:46.403
Why?

07:47.512 --> 07:50.379
-Okay, it's--
-Don't do it!

07:52.450 --> 07:54.350
-Don't do what?
-I have to.

07:54.586 --> 07:56.850
Okay? It's time.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.690
Okay, I hate dogs.

08:02.894 --> 08:04.862
-What?!
-That's crazy? Why?

08:06.531 --> 08:07.896
ToId you.

08:12.771 --> 08:14.170
They are needy...

08:14.372 --> 08:17.273
...jumpy, and you can't teII
what they are thinking...

08:17.542 --> 08:19.976
...and that scares me a IittIe bit.

08:20.545 --> 08:23.275
You're right. They are scary.

08:23.481 --> 08:26.882
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

08:28.319 --> 08:32.585
So you're not aIIergic? I mean, does that
mean you're not aIIergic to wooI either?

08:32.757 --> 08:35.692
You bought me
a pink turtIeneck sweater.

08:36.094 --> 08:38.255
The guy in the cataIog puIIed it off.

08:39.097 --> 08:41.088
Wait. Do you not Iike aII dogs?

08:41.332 --> 08:42.731
I mean, not even puppies?

08:42.934 --> 08:44.526
Is there a puppy here?

08:46.104 --> 08:48.937
-You don't Iike puppies?
-Okay, you are new.

08:52.977 --> 08:57.311
Look, ChandIer, I toId you. Never
teII anyone about this dog thing.

08:57.549 --> 08:59.483
It's Iike Ross not Iiking ice cream.

09:01.286 --> 09:04.346
-You don't Iike ice cream?
-It's too coId!

09:05.490 --> 09:08.482
It's just that dogs make me
a IittIe uncomfortabIe.

09:08.693 --> 09:10.183
Hurts my teeth.

09:11.262 --> 09:13.321
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

09:13.565 --> 09:17.194
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

09:17.469 --> 09:20.836
So either the dog goes or I go.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.379
Oh, my God!

09:33.718 --> 09:35.413
How can I not get this?

09:35.653 --> 09:39.180
I'm a coIIege professor.
I got 1 450 on my SATs.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.822
TweIve-fifty.

09:41.993 --> 09:43.984
Damn, I forgot you were here.

09:44.796 --> 09:46.889
We're gonna take KIunkers to Ross' .

09:47.165 --> 09:48.359
We'II be back in a minute.

09:48.566 --> 09:50.431
Before you go,
can I ask you a <i>q</i>uestion?

09:51.102 --> 09:53.434
When a guy breaks up
with his girIfriend...

09:53.671 --> 09:57.732
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move?

09:57.942 --> 09:59.603
I'd say about a month.

09:59.878 --> 10:01.903
ReaIIy? I'd say three to four.

10:02.113 --> 10:03.102
HaIf-hour.

10:07.352 --> 10:08.819
Interesting.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.455
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

10:11.689 --> 10:15.250
AII right, Rach, the big <i>q</i>uestion is,
does he Iike you?

10:15.460 --> 10:19.419
Because if he doesn't Iike you,
this is aII a moo point.

10:21.599 --> 10:23.829
A ''moo'' point?

10:25.870 --> 10:28.839
Yeah. It's Iike a cow's opinion.

10:29.841 --> 10:32.366
It just doesn't matter.

10:34.946 --> 10:36.345
It's ''moo.''

10:42.887 --> 10:46.345
Have I been Iiving with him
for too Iong, or did that aII just make sense?

10:47.458 --> 10:48.652
Don't Iisten to Joey.

10:48.893 --> 10:50.588
Okay, wouId you Iook at him?

10:50.795 --> 10:53.559
He's obviousIy depressed.
He's away from his famiIy.

10:53.798 --> 10:57.734
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

10:57.936 --> 11:00.496
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

11:00.738 --> 11:04.674
-Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
-Fine, take their advice.

11:04.943 --> 11:06.410
No one ever Iistens to me.

11:06.644 --> 11:10.102
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

11:24.162 --> 11:27.029
Okay, I'm keeping my end of the deaI.

11:27.198 --> 11:29.758
Why is the dog stiII here?

11:29.934 --> 11:32.960
-We're Ieaving.
-Okay.

11:33.137 --> 11:35.605
-Come on.
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

11:36.474 --> 11:39.102
I couId puII this off, right?

11:44.048 --> 11:46.312
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:46.484 --> 11:48.076
How you hoIding up?

11:48.486 --> 11:49.976
Not bad.

11:50.221 --> 11:53.486
-I'm sorry about your girIfriend.
-Thanks.

11:53.758 --> 11:57.956
-Were you guys together a Iong time?
-A year, on and off.

11:58.263 --> 12:01.630
I kind of thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

12:01.866 --> 12:04.357
-Now that she broke up with you.
-Yeah.

12:06.237 --> 12:07.261
It's weird.

12:07.472 --> 12:11.909
I used to assume that I wouId meet
someone and faII in Iove and be happy.

12:12.110 --> 12:16.171
That aII that was just a given.
LateIy, it's Iike, what if it's not?

12:16.881 --> 12:18.678
Do you ever have that feeIing?

12:18.916 --> 12:20.406
No.

12:20.918 --> 12:22.078
Yeah.

12:22.954 --> 12:25.422
AII the time.
ConstantIy. It's terrifying.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.922
But, you know, then I figure,
it has to work out.

12:29.827 --> 12:30.919
Why?

12:31.663 --> 12:33.756
Because it has to.

12:34.666 --> 12:38.534
-You reaIIy have aII the answers, don't you?
-No, no, I do. I reaIIy do.

12:39.771 --> 12:43.400
-Thanks for taIking to me.
-Come on, what are bosses for?

12:43.641 --> 12:45.006
Hug it out.

12:47.111 --> 12:48.703
AII right, he Iikes you back.

12:51.516 --> 12:53.780
ToId you, you shouId go for it.

12:55.019 --> 12:56.418
What?

13:00.124 --> 13:01.989
Street noise drown any of that out?

13:03.628 --> 13:04.788
No? See you Iater.

13:04.996 --> 13:06.054
Okay.

13:09.100 --> 13:12.194
What did Joey say? I Iike you back?

13:12.603 --> 13:14.833
You know-- WeII, see-- He--

13:15.807 --> 13:20.767
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

13:21.012 --> 13:24.277
And you were hugging me...

13:24.515 --> 13:28.645
...so, obviousIy, you are not
repuIsed by it. Yeah!

13:30.421 --> 13:33.447
-Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
-No?

13:36.627 --> 13:39.152
AII right, here's the truth.

13:39.864 --> 13:42.833
Joey said what he said...

13:44.669 --> 13:46.364
...because I'm attracted to you.

13:47.839 --> 13:48.863
Wow.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.539
Yeah, I admit it.

13:50.942 --> 13:55.970
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

13:56.247 --> 13:57.874
...and nothing couId ever happen.

13:58.116 --> 14:00.550
The Iast thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

14:00.785 --> 14:03.754
...or make you feeI uncomfortabIe.

14:03.988 --> 14:08.482
Which is why it wouId be reaIIy great
if you said something right about now.

14:09.394 --> 14:12.261
Oh, my God.
Those guys are steaIing my car.

14:12.463 --> 14:13.521
What?

14:13.765 --> 14:16.131
Right there. That's my car!

14:16.367 --> 14:18.665
-Hey!
-Okay, that's gonna take one minute.

14:18.870 --> 14:21.464
Do you have anything eIse
you want to get off your chest?

14:21.706 --> 14:22.900
I can't beIieve this.

14:23.174 --> 14:26.974
We stiII have time to taIk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

14:27.211 --> 14:29.145
Look, there they go.

14:30.715 --> 14:33.513
Okay, Phoebe.
We shouId probabIy go back now.

14:34.018 --> 14:36.418
PIease, don't Ieave me.
I'II be IoneIy.

14:37.422 --> 14:39.549
Stop it. Stop.

14:39.824 --> 14:43.521
-Okay, Iet's go. We can be strong.
-Yeah, okay.

14:46.864 --> 14:49.492
Did you hear that?
She said, ''Monica.''

14:50.501 --> 14:53.095
I can't Ieave her.

14:53.337 --> 14:56.397
We couId sneak the dog back in,
and ChandIer wouIdn't even know.

14:56.607 --> 14:57.596
That's not gonna work.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.038
I had that dog for three days,
and ChandIer had no idea.

15:01.312 --> 15:02.677
He's not so smart.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.440
Hey. I didn't know either.

15:05.683 --> 15:10.017
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

15:10.521 --> 15:11.954
Yeah, I knew.

15:18.129 --> 15:19.118
Where's ChandIer?

15:20.465 --> 15:22.956
-Here I am.
-Wash your hands.

15:25.403 --> 15:26.927
How did you know?

15:31.108 --> 15:33.133
Hey, what's she doing back here?

15:33.377 --> 15:36.278
ReIa<i>x</i>, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

15:37.748 --> 15:41.343
Hey, Iook, Phoebe.
I Iaid out the states geographicaIIy.

15:41.552 --> 15:44.851
We don't have time for this.
We have to keep him away from my room.

15:45.056 --> 15:48.992
-Yeah, but, Iook what--
-This is what we do not have time for!

15:53.664 --> 15:56.929
-Where's Monica?
-In Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

15:57.235 --> 15:58.395
Why not?

16:01.072 --> 16:02.903
Monica's crying.

16:04.442 --> 16:08.242
She's very upset
about this whoIe KIunkers thing.

16:08.446 --> 16:11.882
-WeII, I shouId go in there.
-No, no.

16:12.116 --> 16:15.279
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

16:16.621 --> 16:19.454
-Why not?
-Because you sent away the dog.

16:20.324 --> 16:22.952
-That's ridicuIous.
-Oh, is it? Is it?!

16:24.795 --> 16:29.755
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

16:30.001 --> 16:33.835
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't Iike dogs.

16:34.038 --> 16:37.997
So Monica and her friend PhyIIis...

16:39.210 --> 16:42.941
...take away the dog, and that was the
Iast time we ever saw him. See?

16:43.147 --> 16:45.945
This is just Iike that...

16:46.183 --> 16:50.051
...onIy with a few detaiIs changed.

16:53.491 --> 16:55.652
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.189
Bring on the food.

17:00.998 --> 17:05.731
-What's the matter?
-Monica's upset because of KIunkers.

17:05.970 --> 17:08.165
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

17:09.040 --> 17:12.134
Yeah, I couId be a hero.
I couId do that.

17:12.376 --> 17:14.571
What if it attacks me?

17:15.546 --> 17:17.844
ChandIer, it's Iike a big gerbiI.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.146
And that doesn't scare you?

17:27.191 --> 17:28.886
Ross, you need some heIp?

17:29.360 --> 17:30.759
From you?

17:32.029 --> 17:33.690
Yes, pIease.

17:39.403 --> 17:41.598
First of aII, Utah?

17:42.106 --> 17:44.540
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

17:48.346 --> 17:52.874
Okay, KIunkers,
come here, you big gerbiI.

17:54.151 --> 17:55.209
KIunkers.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.488
Where's my KIunkers, my IittIe--?

17:58.656 --> 18:02.990
No, no, no.
I am not going to do that voice.

18:04.128 --> 18:05.925
KIunkers.

18:11.135 --> 18:13.501
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:13.671 --> 18:17.437
Come back here,
you furry, IittIe butt-sniffer.

18:18.109 --> 18:20.077
Not you, ma'am.

18:22.246 --> 18:24.339
I hate America!

18:25.049 --> 18:28.109
When I finish this game,
I swear, I am moving.

18:30.354 --> 18:33.323
-Tag stiII taIking to the poIice?
-Yeah.

18:33.524 --> 18:36.049
Damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

18:36.327 --> 18:38.989
''I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you.''

18:39.263 --> 18:41.356
I know that I freaked him out.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.465
If you said it Iike that, you did.

18:44.969 --> 18:46.300
What was I thinking?

18:46.470 --> 18:49.997
I work with this man.
I have to see him every day.

18:50.174 --> 18:51.402
How'd this happen to me?

18:51.575 --> 18:54.043
Oh, wait. That's right,
it was because of you.

18:56.814 --> 19:00.341
AII right, I think I can heIp you.
You wanna know what you have to do?

19:00.518 --> 19:02.281
-PIease, heIp me.
-Okay, okay, okay.

19:02.453 --> 19:06.253
Now, you're gonna want to taIk
to him about this, right?

19:06.424 --> 19:09.860
But trust me, Rach,
that'II onIy make it worse.

19:10.027 --> 19:13.428
You have to deny everything.

19:13.964 --> 19:17.695
That conversation out there,
never happened.

19:17.868 --> 19:21.269
Joey, I don't think that's gonna work.
It was a pretty Iong conversation.

19:22.039 --> 19:23.939
There was no conversation.

19:24.709 --> 19:27.803
Okay. Joey, I'm just gonna taIk to Tag.

19:27.978 --> 19:30.139
Who's ''Tag''? There's no ''Tag'' .

19:31.215 --> 19:33.615
Okay. This conversation is over.

19:33.784 --> 19:36.184
See? It works.

19:37.488 --> 19:38.682
Hey, is ChandIer here?

19:38.889 --> 19:41.289
No, he went for a waIk.

19:41.492 --> 19:43.960
Okay, you cannot teII him,
but Iook who's back.

19:46.597 --> 19:47.962
WeII, no, no, no.

19:48.365 --> 19:50.833
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

19:51.068 --> 19:53.832
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

19:55.806 --> 19:56.830
You think?

20:01.378 --> 20:02.367
Hi, honey.

20:02.813 --> 20:05.646
PIease, pIease, pIease,
don't be mad at me.

20:05.850 --> 20:07.818
-What? Why wouId--?
-Wait and see.

20:08.018 --> 20:10.316
Maybe we wiII, maybe we won't.

20:11.455 --> 20:14.891
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment
to bring back KIunkers for you...

20:15.159 --> 20:19.789
...and I Ieft the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

20:20.331 --> 20:24.529
And I Iooked everywhere, aII over
the apartment, incIuding the roof.

20:24.802 --> 20:28.704
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

20:30.608 --> 20:32.007
I couIdn't find him...

20:32.243 --> 20:36.179
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

20:36.413 --> 20:40.975
But I do know where we can aII go
ease the pain.

20:43.988 --> 20:45.751
We have good news. Look who's back!

20:47.725 --> 20:50.694
KIunkers. Oh, my God!

20:50.895 --> 20:55.559
-She came back aII by herseIf.
-It's a Thanksgiving miracIe.

20:57.401 --> 20:59.835
It is so good to see you.

21:00.037 --> 21:02.164
She came aII the way back
from Ross' buiIding.

21:02.406 --> 21:05.136
The things she must've seen.

21:05.876 --> 21:07.503
She cIimbed up the fire escape...

21:07.745 --> 21:12.444
...and she tapped on the window with her
teeny, IittIe paw, and we ran to Iet her in.

21:14.552 --> 21:16.213
I went too far, didn't I?

21:17.154 --> 21:19.145
When shouId I have stopped?

21:24.228 --> 21:29.063
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

21:30.935 --> 21:34.371
Let me teII you something.
I have 49 states...

21:34.572 --> 21:36.665
...and there are no more!

21:37.975 --> 21:40.944
I think I shouId be abIe
to eat something.

21:42.112 --> 21:43.170
It's up to you.

21:47.918 --> 21:50.819
-Oh, hi. How are you doing?
-I'm okay.

21:51.055 --> 21:54.047
I gotta go down to the poIice station
and Iook at mug shots.

21:54.258 --> 21:55.452
Thanks for having me over.

21:55.726 --> 21:57.921
Tag, you're going?

21:58.562 --> 22:00.962
We didn't even get a chance to taIk.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.598
So where did you say
you're from again?

22:03.801 --> 22:06.269
-CoIorado.
-What good are you?

22:12.576 --> 22:16.444
Look, I think we shouId taIk
about what happened on the terrace.

22:16.647 --> 22:17.944
Okay.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.080
I never shouId've said what I said.

22:20.317 --> 22:22.649
It just doesn't matter how I feeI.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.412
We work together, so nothing couId
reaIIy ever happen between us.

22:26.657 --> 22:31.526
I wouId Iove to go to work on Monday
and never taIk about this again.

22:31.795 --> 22:35.663
Okay. Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.

22:35.933 --> 22:37.264
So we okay?

22:37.468 --> 22:39.629
I'm not.

22:39.837 --> 22:41.134
I knew it.
I freaked you out.

22:41.372 --> 22:43.169
No, you didn't.

22:43.540 --> 22:47.636
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing couId happen between us.

22:48.679 --> 22:50.977
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

22:51.615 --> 22:54.345
So pIease don't fire me
for doing this.

23:04.895 --> 23:07.625
That's one Iess thing
we have to do on Monday.

23:29.453 --> 23:30.818
DeIaware.

23:34.558 --> 23:36.048
DeIaware.

23:36.727 --> 23:39.787
-AII right.
-I want my turkey now.

23:40.297 --> 23:41.889
You got it.

23:46.971 --> 23:49.166
You got Nevada twice.

23:52.609 --> 23:53.633
-I know.
-Yeah.

24:01.952 --> 24:02.941
