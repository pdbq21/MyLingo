00:07.207 --> 00:12.338
Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very long but would it be possible...

00:12.545 --> 00:15.639
...if I got a $1 00 advance
on my salary?

00:16.216 --> 00:17.513
An advance?

00:17.717 --> 00:20.652
So I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.984
Every year we ski in Vail,
and my father pays for my ticket.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.217
But I've started
this independent thing...

00:28.428 --> 00:31.488
...which is actually why
I took this "job. "

00:33.099 --> 00:35.932
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

00:36.669 --> 00:39.229
You' re a terrible, terrible waitress.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.566
Really, really awful.

00:44.077 --> 00:47.274
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

00:49.249 --> 00:53.549
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.983
I really do.

00:56.189 --> 00:59.215
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.

01:02.695 --> 01:03.855
Look at that.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.259
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

01:52.579 --> 01:56.140
Excuse me, sir? Hi.
You come in here all the time.

01:56.349 --> 02:01.685
Do you think there's a possibility
that you could advance me my tips?

02:02.822 --> 02:08.158
Okay, okay. That's fine. Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

02:09.362 --> 02:11.387
Only 98.50 to go!

02:12.799 --> 02:17.532
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

02:17.737 --> 02:21.730
-What? No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.533
You' re wrong.

02:24.377 --> 02:27.608
-I am not wrong.
-You' re wrong.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.911
No, I just talked to them.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.609
I' m calling Mom.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.287
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!

02:41.794 --> 02:46.731
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

02:48.134 --> 02:54.130
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
Joey T ribbiani, actor/model.

02:54.374 --> 02:59.937
That's funny. I was thinking you look
more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.915
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.679
So you' re gonna be one
of those healthy guys?

03:08.888 --> 03:12.915
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-Know which one you'll be?

03:13.126 --> 03:17.222
No, but I hear Lyme disease
is open, so you know....

03:17.430 --> 03:20.888
-Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
-Thanks.

03:24.637 --> 03:28.664
You were right. How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!

03:28.875 --> 03:33.403
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.878
Will you make mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

03:37.450 --> 03:42.080
They're not actually supposed to
I'll work on the lumps.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.823
-Joey, you' re going home?
-Yeah.

03:45.024 --> 03:49.461
Chandler, you' re still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

03:56.302 --> 04:00.671
We're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.041
So you're free Thursday then?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.613
-Yeah. Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.

04:11.251 --> 04:16.518
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

04:16.723 --> 04:20.352
-Only $1 02 to go.
-I thought it was 98. 50?

04:20.560 --> 04:24.360
Yeah, well, it was, but l
I broke a cup, so....

04:24.964 --> 04:29.264
-Well, l' m off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

04:30.336 --> 04:34.796
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife
and will want to bring her...

04:35.008 --> 04:37.806
...ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.880
Hi. Is Carol here?

04:49.088 --> 04:54.583
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skull.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.957
Well, not mine, but....

04:58.531 --> 05:00.294
-Come in.
-Thanks.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.698
Carol borrowed it, and I have
to get it back to the museum.

05:04.904 --> 05:09.807
-What's it look like?
-Kind of like a big face without skin.

05:10.643 --> 05:15.046
Yes. I'm familiar with the concept.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.808
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.

05:23.022 --> 05:28.358
Wow, you guys sure have a lot
of books about being a lesbian.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.494
Well, you know,
you have to take a course.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.266
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

05:46.813 --> 05:50.579
Hey, Yertle the Turtle! A classic.

05:50.783 --> 05:54.583
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.849
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

05:59.058 --> 06:02.152
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?

06:03.996 --> 06:07.329
You don't think
they can hear sounds in there?

06:07.533 --> 06:11.469
You' re not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?

06:12.038 --> 06:16.634
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.948
Well, that's just
Do you talk about me?

06:24.784 --> 06:27.947
-Yeah. All the time.
-Really?

06:28.154 --> 06:33.649
But, we just refer to you
as " Bobo the Sperm Guy. "

06:44.003 --> 06:49.339
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly time too.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.510
Not that I believe this.

06:51.711 --> 06:55.374
I believe it. I think the baby
can hear everything.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.482
-Really?
-I'll show you. This'll seem weird.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.812
But you put your head
inside this turkey...

07:02.488 --> 07:06.390
...and we'll all talk
and you'll hear everything we say.

07:07.493 --> 07:11.987
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

07:12.198 --> 07:16.157
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.068
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?

07:22.275 --> 07:26.177
No, not even close. Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

07:26.379 --> 07:30.008
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

07:31.751 --> 07:37.155
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks. You can put it on the table.

07:37.356 --> 07:41.019
No. Here's your mail!

07:41.794 --> 07:45.787
Thanks. You can put it on the table!

07:45.998 --> 07:48.125
Would you just open it!

07:50.403 --> 07:55.739
Oh, my God! You guys are great!

07:55.942 --> 07:58.206
We all chipped in.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.073
-We did?
-You owe me $20.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.840
Thank you. Thank you so much!

08:04.050 --> 08:07.952
Chandler, got your traditional
holiday feast. T omato soup...

08:08.154 --> 08:12.181
...grilled-cheese fixings
and a family-size bag of Funyuns.

08:12.391 --> 08:17.920
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?

08:19.031 --> 08:22.262
-I'm 9 years old.
-I hate this story!

08:22.468 --> 08:26.734
We've finished this magnificent
Thanksgiving dinner. I have...

08:26.939 --> 08:29.100
...a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

08:29.308 --> 08:33.039
And then my parents tell me
they're getting divorced.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.577
Oh, my God!

08:34.780 --> 08:40.116
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

08:42.855 --> 08:46.586
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.522
-It's a yam.
-Hello....

08:50.463 --> 08:55.662
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.267
They don't They don't come in these.

08:59.805 --> 09:04.401
Ross, don't take this the wrong way
or anything, but back off.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.588
Hi.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.456
-We used to work together.
-We did?

09:23.663 --> 09:27.224
Yeah, at Macy's.
You' re the Obsession girl, right?

09:27.433 --> 09:30.425
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.

09:31.404 --> 09:36.341
-Aramis. Aramis. Aramis.
-Yeah, right!

09:37.276 --> 09:40.643
-You' re the best in the business.
-Get out.

09:40.846 --> 09:45.874
You' re amazing! You know when
to spritz. You know when to lay back.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.953
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

09:51.991 --> 09:56.690
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

09:56.896 --> 09:58.454
Nothing.

10:07.640 --> 10:13.135
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be

10:14.380 --> 10:17.975
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.583
What?

10:21.988 --> 10:25.788
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!

11:08.334 --> 11:10.564
So I guess you all saw it.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.101
-What?
-Saw what?

11:12.304 --> 11:17.037
No, we' re just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

11:35.895 --> 11:40.992
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.197
"T onight, on a very special Blossom. "

11:53.245 --> 11:54.974
Looking good! Okay!

11:55.181 --> 11:59.948
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying,
yams are yamming....

12:00.386 --> 12:01.819
What?

12:02.021 --> 12:06.788
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

12:06.992 --> 12:09.358
Get out and stop annoying me!

12:09.562 --> 12:11.393
Oh, that's closer.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.595
I got the tickets!

12:14.800 --> 12:18.896
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

12:19.105 --> 12:23.599
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, l' m gonna get my stuff.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.333
Will you come in?

12:25.544 --> 12:29.776
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

12:29.982 --> 12:33.509
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

12:39.859 --> 12:44.523
We laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

12:45.164 --> 12:49.498
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.

12:49.702 --> 12:54.298
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them. It's a tradition.

12:54.507 --> 12:59.809
You get a piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a T ot!

13:00.546 --> 13:06.610
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be
with my family because of my disease.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.318
All right. Fine.

13:09.522 --> 13:15.427
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed,
with lumps and in the form of Tots.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.829
All right, I'm off
to talk to my unborn child.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.700
Okay, Mom never hit.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.936
Okay, all done.

13:31.143 --> 13:36.137
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
Ross needs lumps!

13:36.348 --> 13:38.043
Oh, l' m sorry! I just

13:38.250 --> 13:43.483
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.054
Why do that?

13:45.257 --> 13:50.422
Because then they'd be just like my
mom used to make it, before she died.

13:52.131 --> 13:55.999
Okay. Three kinds
of potatoes coming up.

13:57.303 --> 14:01.069
Okay. Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!

14:01.273 --> 14:05.334
Oh, God, look at
Sorry! I'm so sorry.

14:06.545 --> 14:10.413
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!

14:10.616 --> 14:15.178
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.384
Of course the balloon!

14:18.591 --> 14:23.358
He broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park.

14:23.562 --> 14:27.191
-I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
-I can't!

14:27.399 --> 14:31.426
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?

14:31.637 --> 14:32.968
Almost never.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.664
-Got the keys?
-Okay.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.710
Anytime you' re ready.

14:43.916 --> 14:47.408
Okay. Okay, here we go.

14:52.258 --> 14:55.523
Okay. Where am I talking to here?

14:56.428 --> 15:01.263
There is one way that offers a
certain acoustical advantage, but....

15:02.134 --> 15:04.466
Just aim for the bump.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.335
Okay.

15:06.872 --> 15:10.569
Okay. Okay. Okay, here goes.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.716
You know, I can't do this. This is

15:21.921 --> 15:24.856
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

15:25.057 --> 15:29.653
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

15:29.862 --> 15:33.764
Hello, baby. Hello. Hello.

15:34.633 --> 15:38.694
the moment we first saw
the dog shadow fall over the park!

15:38.904 --> 15:42.897
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

15:43.575 --> 15:47.534
Right now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside...

15:47.746 --> 15:50.044
...and juicy on the inside.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.313
Why are we standing here?

15:52.518 --> 15:56.545
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You have the keys.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.313
No, I don't.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.955
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, "Got the keys. "

16:03.595 --> 16:07.861
No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys? "

16:08.701 --> 16:11.761
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys! "

16:11.971 --> 16:15.270
Do either of you have the keys?

16:16.141 --> 16:19.076
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!

16:19.278 --> 16:22.304
-Wait! We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!

16:22.514 --> 16:25.449
That tone won't make me go any faster.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.881
-Joey.
-That one will.

16:30.589 --> 16:35.492
And everyone's telling me,
"You gotta pick a major. "

16:35.694 --> 16:40.290
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

16:40.499 --> 16:45.937
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, face it, you' re a fetus.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.399
You're happy you don't
have gills anymore.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.670
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing

16:54.880 --> 16:58.543
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach, okay?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.952
How's it going?

17:01.153 --> 17:02.916
Here we come

17:03.122 --> 17:05.352
Walking down the street

17:05.557 --> 17:09.425
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

17:09.628 --> 17:11.289
Hey, hey

17:14.066 --> 17:16.933
-Hey, did you just feel that?
-I did.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.934
-Does it always?
-That was the first.

17:20.139 --> 17:22.198
IKeep singing! IKeep singing!

17:22.408 --> 17:26.742
Hey, hey, you 're my baby
And I can 't wait to meet you

17:26.945 --> 17:31.439
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
Then we 'll go to the zoo

17:31.650 --> 17:34.244
-lt did it again!
-I felt it that time!

17:34.453 --> 17:39.117
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
I'm the one without any breasts

17:42.828 --> 17:47.288
This is great. It's 5:00. My plane
is pulling away from the gate.

17:47.499 --> 17:50.935
-Maybe you can take a later flight.
-There is none.

17:51.136 --> 17:54.867
-You can go tomorrow.
-T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!

17:55.074 --> 17:59.101
If l' m gonna cheer you up,
you have to meet me halfway.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.942
Can you go any faster?

18:02.214 --> 18:06.275
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

18:06.485 --> 18:10.012
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

18:10.222 --> 18:12.622
For an emergency just like this.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.019
All right. Listen, smirky!

18:16.228 --> 18:19.959
If not for your stupid balloon,
I'd be on a plane...

18:20.165 --> 18:23.931
...watching a woman do this... right
now. But l' m not!

18:25.270 --> 18:27.101
You said you had the keys!

18:27.306 --> 18:31.902
No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had
the keys unless I had the keys!

18:32.111 --> 18:36.104
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!

18:38.217 --> 18:40.913
Why would I have the keys?!

18:41.120 --> 18:44.385
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-I didn't!

18:44.590 --> 18:45.921
-You should've.
-Why?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.114
-Because!
-Why?

18:47.326 --> 18:52.093
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that l' m making dinner?

18:52.297 --> 18:56.529
Everyone wants a different kind
of potato, so I'm making them.

18:56.735 --> 19:01.695
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want? No!

19:01.907 --> 19:03.738
No! No!

19:03.942 --> 19:08.936
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his T ots

19:09.148 --> 19:13.244
It's my first Thanksgiving, and l

19:13.452 --> 19:16.512
It's all burnt, and I can't....

19:18.123 --> 19:23.686
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.735
-All right, Chandler, don't lose this.
-No

19:35.741 --> 19:38.801
Well, the turkey's burnt!

19:39.011 --> 19:43.277
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

19:43.882 --> 19:45.713
Here we come

19:45.918 --> 19:47.886
Walking down the

19:49.955 --> 19:52.617
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

19:54.126 --> 19:59.894
It doesn't, does it? You wanted lumps?
Here you go, buddy. You got one!

20:00.332 --> 20:05.531
-Don't yell at me. You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!

20:06.205 --> 20:11.609
God, this is great! The plane is gone.
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

20:11.810 --> 20:15.906
We all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice!

20:16.114 --> 20:21.279
Oh, really? So why was I busting
my ass to make this delicious dinner?

20:21.486 --> 20:24.649
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!

20:26.158 --> 20:28.649
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

20:28.860 --> 20:31.693
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.498
Skiing.

20:40.272 --> 20:44.231
Shoop, shoop, shoop....

20:44.443 --> 20:45.967
Shoop.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.443
-Eww.
-What?

20:49.648 --> 20:53.584
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey
out of the oven.

20:54.219 --> 20:57.620
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.518
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

21:03.228 --> 21:08.495
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.433
I gotta see this!

21:14.006 --> 21:16.133
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

21:16.742 --> 21:19.210
Ugly naked dancing!

21:20.078 --> 21:22.410
It's nice that he has someone.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.183
Shall I carve?

21:35.594 --> 21:37.562
-By all means.
-All right.

21:42.734 --> 21:46.295
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

21:46.505 --> 21:50.168
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.935
-Does anybody wanna split this?
-I will.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.546
-You guys have to make a wish.
-Make a wish?

21:56.748 --> 21:59.478
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

22:03.622 --> 22:07.285
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.426
The bigger half.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.160
All right, I'd like
to propose a toast.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.766
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

22:16.968 --> 22:19.664
This isn't the Thanksgiving
you planned...

22:19.871 --> 22:23.830
...but for me,
this has been really great.

22:24.042 --> 22:29.981
I think because it didn't involve
divorce or projectile vomiting.

22:31.483 --> 22:35.647
If you'd gone to Vail
or if you had been with your family...

22:35.854 --> 22:39.381
...or if you didn't have syphilis
and stuff...

22:42.027 --> 22:43.995
...we wouldn't be together.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.960
I guess what l' m trying
to say is that...

22:47.165 --> 22:52.000
... I' m very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

22:52.838 --> 22:56.239
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.771
-Here's to a lousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!

23:01.980 --> 23:04.505
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!
