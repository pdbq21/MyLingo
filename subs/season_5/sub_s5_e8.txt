00:08.174 --> 00:10.802
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.571
It was so good.
I think you killed us.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.646
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.043
I need something sweet.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.079
Does anyone want to watch TV?

00:27.093 --> 00:29.152
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.921
You have to lift it and point.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.501
Oh, forget it.

00:38.405 --> 00:43.035
Let's play that game where everyone
says one thing they're thankful for.

00:44.210 --> 00:48.010
I am thankful for this
beautiful fall we've been having.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.772
Very nice.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.218
The other day,
I was at the bus stop...

00:52.419 --> 00:56.947
...and this lovely fall breeze came
and blew this chick's skirt up.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.794
Which reminds me,
I'm also thankful for thongs.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.627
The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks

01:52.512 --> 01:55.709
It's not so much an underpant
as a feat of engineering.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.374
It's amazing...

01:58.585 --> 02:01.816
...how much they can do
with so little material.

02:02.055 --> 02:06.219
And they play with your mind.
Is it there? Is it not there?

02:07.227 --> 02:09.889
Are you aware that
you're still talking?

02:10.897 --> 02:14.526
Is anyone thankful for anything else
besides a thong?

02:15.101 --> 02:19.265
I don't know. Am I more thankful
for my divorce or my eviction?

02:19.572 --> 02:22.769
And I didn't think you'd be able
to come up with anything.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.170
I'm sorry. This is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.575
I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

02:30.850 --> 02:34.911
You can't swoop in with your bad
marriage and take that away from me.

02:35.421 --> 02:39.118
You're not going to tell about your
parents' divorce again, are you?

02:41.094 --> 02:43.062
Come on! I want to hear it.

02:44.898 --> 02:48.459
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Chandler bumming us out.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.536
It's a tradition, like the parade.

02:51.771 --> 02:56.231
If the parade decided it was gay
and abandoned its family.

02:59.279 --> 03:00.576
Now, Chandler, dear...

03:00.813 --> 03:02.974
...just because
we're getting a divorce...

03:03.216 --> 03:04.945
...doesn't mean we don't love you.

03:05.618 --> 03:06.642
It just means...

03:06.886 --> 03:10.378
...he would rather sleep
with the houseboy than with me.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.386
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?

03:19.432 --> 03:23.334
Every time you tell that story,
that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.297
So are he and your dad still together?

03:27.473 --> 03:31.569
No. After they got their own place,
the houseboy got his own houseboy.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.109
Should have heard his accent.

03:34.614 --> 03:38.607
You're right, yours is worse.
You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.015
I've got one that's worse.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.554
Really? Worse than,
"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"

03:46.793 --> 03:49.193
Did the little rich boy
have a problem with the butler?

03:49.395 --> 03:51.226
Yes, mine's worse!

03:56.936 --> 03:58.233
More bandages!

03:58.471 --> 04:00.405
More bandages!

04:00.640 --> 04:03.302
Please, can I get
some more bandages in here?

04:03.576 --> 04:05.407
This man is

04:14.621 --> 04:16.714
In this life, Phoebe.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.155
Oh, this life. Oh, okay.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.654
No, Chandler's is worse.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.053
It must be cool
remembering stuff like that.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.733
I don't have any past-life memories.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.462
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.631
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.406
Let's not tell this story.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.002
I know!

04:40.246 --> 04:44.080
It's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

04:46.352 --> 04:49.185
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.786
It's not like it sounds.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.083
It's exactly like it sounds.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.140
What's going on?

05:15.348 --> 05:16.542
Oh, my God!

05:16.816 --> 05:18.010
I know!

05:18.484 --> 05:20.042
It's stuck!

05:21.621 --> 05:22.610
Step.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.379
How did it get on?

05:24.624 --> 05:27.115
I put it on to scare Chandler.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.996
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!

05:31.197 --> 05:32.630
Help me get it off!

05:32.865 --> 05:35.629
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

05:37.003 --> 05:41.167
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a dead animal's ass.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.182
Did you get the turkey?

05:53.386 --> 05:54.978
Oh, my God!

05:55.221 --> 05:56.210
Who is that?

05:56.889 --> 05:58.652
It's Joey.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.990
Is this supposed to be funny?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.289
It's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.791
Get that off now!

06:08.034 --> 06:10.002
I can't. It's stuck!

06:10.203 --> 06:14.833
It has to feed 20 people. They're
not going to eat it off your head!

06:15.375 --> 06:16.364
Hold on.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.669
Let's just all think.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.308
I got it!

06:26.486 --> 06:27.475
You pull.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.747
I'll spread the legs
as wide as I can.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.717
Now is not the time.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.660
Count to three. One...

06:38.831 --> 06:39.855
...two...

06:40.032 --> 06:41.158
...three!

06:44.737 --> 06:47.672
It worked!
I scared you! I knew it!

06:50.209 --> 06:51.267
I'm here, big guy.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.034
Yeah, you are!

06:53.913 --> 06:55.380
I scared you!

06:58.951 --> 07:01.249
You did look like an idiot.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.016
I wasn't the only one
who looked like an idiot.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.591
Remember when Ross tried to say
"butternut squash"...

07:08.795 --> 07:11.958
...and it came out,
"squatternut bosh"?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.197
Yeah, that's the same.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.200
That's it.
That's my worst Thanksgiving.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.466
That can't be the one Rachel meant.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.768
She didn't even know that happened.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.541
So, what's yours?

07:28.381 --> 07:30.815
I really don't want
to tell this story.

07:31.050 --> 07:35.783
Reliving pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's all about.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.584
For me, anyway.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.624
And, of course, the lndians.

07:41.894 --> 07:44.761
Of all people, you do not want me
to tell this story.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.727
What is that supposed to mean?

07:48.601 --> 07:51.434
-Monica, I think Rachel's here!
-I'll get it!

07:58.578 --> 07:59.636
Happy Thanksgiving!

07:59.846 --> 08:01.404
Not for me.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.945
Chip and I broke up.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.508
Why?

08:05.785 --> 08:07.013
What happened?

08:07.253 --> 08:10.450
My parents are out of town,
and Chip was going to come over.

08:11.023 --> 08:13.116
And you were going to give him...

08:13.359 --> 08:14.621
...your "flower."

08:15.828 --> 08:17.693
Monica, can you just call it sex?

08:17.997 --> 08:21.023
It really creeps me out
when you call it that.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.427
And by the way...

08:22.668 --> 08:26.536
...while we're at it, a guy's thing
is not called his "tenderness."

08:29.609 --> 08:31.270
Believe me.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.809
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.346
Everyone...

08:45.558 --> 08:47.617
...this is Chandler.

08:47.827 --> 08:48.851
My roommate...

08:49.061 --> 08:51.723
...and lead singer of our band.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.998
This is Monica.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.466
I'm Ross' little sister.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.910
I'm so glad you could come.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.476
We've got plenty of food,
so I hope you're hungry.

09:08.681 --> 09:13.482
Chandler hates Thanksgiving
and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.521
I'm so glad you brought him here.

09:19.325 --> 09:22.158
I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.260
As long as the Pilgrims
didn't eat it.

09:28.601 --> 09:29.863
Damn it!

09:41.047 --> 09:43.106
Does it feel weird around here now?

09:43.349 --> 09:46.546
You know, since
I've been away at college?

09:47.687 --> 09:48.847
Not really.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.548
That's cool.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.626
So that's Rachel, the girl you've been
writing all those songs about?

10:00.800 --> 10:05.794
Might want to rethink the lyrics to
"She Feels Weird Since I've Been Gone."

10:09.342 --> 10:14.211
I cannot believe Chip dumped me
for that slut Nancy Branson!

10:14.413 --> 10:18.679
I am never going out with him again.
I don't care how much he begs.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.910
His begging days are over, now
that he's with Nancy Branson.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.788
I've just had it
with high-school boys.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.426
They're just silly.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.892
They're just silly, stupid boys.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.497
I'll start dating men.

10:36.002 --> 10:36.991
I'm sorry, Judy.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.832
I couldn't find that bowl
you and Jack were looking for.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.708
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.284
Did you like
the macaroni and cheese?

11:01.527 --> 11:03.518
It was great.
You should be a chef.

11:09.802 --> 11:10.962
Guess what.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.400
All this stuff about Nancy
being a slut was all a rumor.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.940
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house!

11:18.144 --> 11:20.374
-That is so great!
-I know.

11:20.613 --> 11:24.140
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...

11:24.383 --> 11:26.442
...promise me
you'll tell me everything.

11:26.652 --> 11:30.486
Totally. It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.988
But now you'll definitely know
whether or not you did it.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.386
I know.

11:35.895 --> 11:40.628
And Chip promised that this time
it'd last at least for an entire song.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.428
I'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight...

11:45.671 --> 11:48.299
...maybe playing her that song
we wrote last week.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.838
"Emotional Knapsack"?
Right on!

11:53.145 --> 11:56.774
But don't take long.
We're testing our fake lD's tonight.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.847
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

12:00.653 --> 12:02.951
Listen, Roland Cheng...

12:04.356 --> 12:07.416
...if things go well,
I may be out with her all night.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.823
Dude, don't do that to me.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.497
It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

12:12.698 --> 12:16.657
It's not that. I just don't want
to be stuck here with your fat sister.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.698
Why don't you finish off these pies?

12:22.975 --> 12:25.205
I don't have any more room
in the fridge.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.137
No, thank you.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.778
Judy, you did it.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.952
She's finally full!

12:38.491 --> 12:39.958
I called you fat?

12:40.159 --> 12:42.389
-I don't even remember that.
-Maybe it'd jog your memory...

12:42.561 --> 12:45.894
...if you guys played
a little bit of "Emotional Knapsack."

12:47.399 --> 12:49.196
I'm so sorry. I really am.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.766
I was an idiot back then.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.834
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert,
for crying out loud!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.004
I can't believe you called her fat.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.179
I can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.173
I am really sorry.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.283
That is terrible. I'm so sorry.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.583
That's not the Thanksgiving
I was talking about.

13:10.756 --> 13:11.745
Yes, it was.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.448
No, it was actually

13:13.726 --> 13:16.889
Thanksgiving's over.
Let's get ready for Christmas.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.463
I have the cutest Christmas story.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.531
We want to hear Monica's story.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.865
Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half,
but, you know, whatever.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.777
You changed your major again?

13:33.279 --> 13:34.268
I had to.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.643
There was never any parking
by the psychology building.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.985
Love your new nose!

13:43.722 --> 13:45.815
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.423
He removed my mole cluster.

13:47.726 --> 13:48.954
Want to see?

13:50.462 --> 13:52.089
No! Please, let me.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.903
Happy Thanksgiving.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.940
Your hair sure is different.

14:06.145 --> 14:07.908
We were just talking about that.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.604
We can't believe
how stupid we used to look.

14:14.653 --> 14:15.642
Where's Monica?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.479
She's upstairs.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.419
Come down, everyone's here!

14:19.658 --> 14:20.647
Ross, Rachel...

14:20.926 --> 14:23.520
...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.491
Oh, my God!

14:31.203 --> 14:32.795
What's the matter?

14:33.005 --> 14:35.439
Is there something on my dress?

14:37.676 --> 14:39.109
You look so different.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.267
Terrific.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.073
That dress, that body....

14:42.281 --> 14:43.509
-Dude!
-Sorry.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.451
Yes, she's thin. It's wonderful.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.278
But we really want to hear...

14:49.488 --> 14:51.683
...about Ross' new girlfriend.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.788
Her name is Carol.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.996
She's really pretty and smart.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.290
She's on the lacrosse team
and the golf team.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.024
Can you believe it?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.362
She plays for both teams.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.675
So I guess I'll see you at dinner.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.634
-Dude!
-Sorry.

15:15.714 --> 15:16.738
Oh, my God!

15:17.016 --> 15:18.643
That was so awesome.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.876
You got him back
for calling you fat.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.849
He was drooling all over you.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.649
-That must have felt so great.
-lt didn't.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.719
Yeah, I mean, I look great.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.660
I feel great, and my heart's
not in trouble anymore.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.691
I just don't feel
like I got him back.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.905
I just want to humiliate him.

15:40.172 --> 15:44.336
I want him to be naked, and
I want to point at him and laugh.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.941
That, we may be able to do.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.071
How?

15:51.283 --> 15:55.083
Guys tend to get naked
before they're going to have sex.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.243
What?

15:56.422 --> 15:58.856
I didn't work this hard
and lose weight...

15:59.124 --> 16:02.423
...just so I could give my flower
to someone like him.

16:02.828 --> 16:06.559
First of all, if you keep calling it that,
no one will take it.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.294
And then second of all,
you're not going to have sex with him.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.900
You'll just make him
think that you are.

16:16.041 --> 16:19.101
I'll throw him out
in the yard, lock the door...

16:19.311 --> 16:22.109
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him!

16:22.648 --> 16:24.639
You'll definitely get him back.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.976
How do I make him think
I want to have sex?

16:27.486 --> 16:29.147
Here's what you do.

16:29.421 --> 16:33.414
Just act like everything around you
turns you on.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.623
What do you mean?

16:37.930 --> 16:39.295
Anything can be sexy.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.994
Like this dish towel.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.969
This feels so good against my cheek.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.939
And if I get a little hot,
I can just dab myself with it.

16:54.947 --> 16:58.474
Or I can bring it down to my side
and run it through my fingers...

16:58.684 --> 17:00.117
...while I talk to him.

17:00.486 --> 17:01.475
I can do that.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.114
Good, good, good.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.016
Get busy. He's coming.

17:06.091 --> 17:07.456
Hey, what's up?

17:10.429 --> 17:14.365
Could you make me some of that
righteous mac and cheese like last year?

17:15.167 --> 17:16.156
I'd love to.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.006
I love macaroni and cheese.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.513
I love the way this box feels
against my cheek.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.891
And I love carrots.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.699
Sometimes I like to put them
between my fingers.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.158
Like this.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.997
And hold them down here
while I talk to you.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.639
And, you know, if I get really hot...

18:02.548 --> 18:05.517
...I like to pick up this knife.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.884
And I put the cool steel...

18:11.156 --> 18:12.384
...against...

18:13.592 --> 18:15.219
...my body.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.388
Are you all right?

18:19.832 --> 18:20.821
I'm fine.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.738
Twenty-year-old male.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.418
He's got a severed toe
on his right foot.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.114
Could you please not
do that feet first?

18:45.390 --> 18:48.757
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

18:50.395 --> 18:52.761
It says the knife went
through your shoe.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.296
They're made of wicker!

18:56.268 --> 18:57.599
Did you bring the toe?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.031
I have it right here on ice.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.434
Toes on Ice, coming soon
to Madison Square Garden.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.837
Save your strength, man.

19:04.243 --> 19:07.041
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then....

19:07.846 --> 19:08.835
What is it?

19:09.214 --> 19:10.647
You brought a carrot.

19:13.752 --> 19:17.813
This isn't your toe. This is a small,
very cold piece of carrot.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.081
You brought a carrot?

19:20.359 --> 19:21.883
Oh, my God!

19:22.227 --> 19:24.320
There's a toe in my kitchen.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.059
I'm sorry! I'll go get it!

19:28.267 --> 19:30.235
All we can do now
is sew up the wound.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.733
Without my toe? I need my toe!

19:32.938 --> 19:36.271
I can go really fast!
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.737
I'm not falling for that one.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.280
That's why I lost my toe?
Because I called you fat?

19:45.551 --> 19:48.019
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.882
That's why for an entire year
people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?

19:53.058 --> 19:54.582
I'm sorry.

19:55.627 --> 19:57.060
It wasn't your whole toe.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.196
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.725
It's the best part.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.563
It has the nail.

20:09.074 --> 20:10.234
Sir Limps-a-lot.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.306
I came up with that.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.480
You're a dork.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.213
-I can't believe this.
-I said I was sorry.

20:21.453 --> 20:24.581
"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy
that cried all the way home.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.953
It figures that something like this
would happen today.

20:29.127 --> 20:32.187
I hate this stupid day
and everything about it!

20:32.397 --> 20:33.386
I'll see you later.

20:33.632 --> 20:34.621
Wait.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.199
Come here.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.234
Is there anything I can do?
Anything?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.874
Just leave me alone for a little while.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.943
I'm a duck.
I go quack-quack.

20:51.149 --> 20:53.208
I'm happy all the time.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.589
Nice try.

21:05.797 --> 21:07.424
Wait, wait, wait.

21:10.636 --> 21:11.796
Look, Monica

21:16.308 --> 21:17.775
This is not going to work.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.671
I bet this will work.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.109
You're so great.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.755
I love you.

21:42.034 --> 21:45.970
Nothing. I said you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.937
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this!

21:50.142 --> 21:51.200
No, I didn't!

21:53.011 --> 21:54.035
Yes, you did!

21:54.279 --> 21:55.439
No, I didn't!

21:56.348 --> 21:57.872
You love me!

21:58.116 --> 21:59.105
No, I don't!

21:59.384 --> 22:01.045
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

22:13.365 --> 22:14.559
Gauze!

22:14.900 --> 22:15.889
Gauze!

22:16.068 --> 22:18.229
I need to get some gauze in here!

22:18.503 --> 22:21.961
Can I please get some more gauze?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.312
This is getting ridiculous.
