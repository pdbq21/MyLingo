WEBVTT

00:11.544 --> 00:13.705
Are you kidding me?

00:15.615 --> 00:17.207
Joey?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.042
Did I wake you?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.305
The One with
All the Wedding Dresses

01:34.527 --> 01:37.428
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

01:39.866 --> 01:42.926
So what do you do when
you're not working here?

01:43.103 --> 01:46.664
-You don't need to fill these silences.
-Okay, thanks.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.975
That's your fourth cup of coffee.

01:51.144 --> 01:56.138
Okay, do me.
I've had a certain number of juices.

01:58.318 --> 02:02.049
I'm exhausted because
Joey started snoring.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.382
He's in a different room.
He's that loud?

02:04.591 --> 02:05.853
You should hear me.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.857
It's nothing to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.658
I'm not going to any clinic.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.495
I don't have a problem.
You have the problem.

02:16.669 --> 02:20.730
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.907
-They don't have those.
-Yeah, they do.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.202
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

02:25.445 --> 02:28.005
There, you just had your first class.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.180
I used to date a light sleeper.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.681
Whenever I snored,
he rolled me over

02:33.853 --> 02:35.548
Oh, yeah!

02:38.892 --> 02:41.417
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.356
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

02:44.898 --> 02:48.891
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

02:49.602 --> 02:50.864
Hey, guys.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.765
Oh, the Olympics!

02:59.279 --> 03:02.248
-Have you picked a date?
-No. Not yet.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.746
I still cannot believe
you're engaged.

03:06.252 --> 03:09.585
Because it's so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.682
Thanks. Has anyone seen Rach?

03:13.927 --> 03:15.895
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.

03:16.129 --> 03:20.566
I won't do them this time.
Even if they sit there until....

03:20.767 --> 03:23.327
I'll do them when I get home.

03:25.838 --> 03:28.636
Emily found this
wedding dress in London

03:28.841 --> 03:31.071
-Already?
-But it didn't fit.

03:31.244 --> 03:35.772
There's a store here with one left in her size.
But the groom can't see

03:35.982 --> 03:37.813
-I'll pick it up for you.
-Thanks.

03:38.084 --> 03:42.248
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses....

03:42.455 --> 03:43.922
Wah-pah!

03:46.593 --> 03:48.322
What's wah-pah?

03:48.795 --> 03:50.524
You know. Whipped.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.025
Wah-pah!

03:54.934 --> 03:56.765
That's not whipped.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.767
Whipped is....

04:01.040 --> 04:02.564
That's what I did.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.746
You can't do anything!

04:22.729 --> 04:25.892
Hey, Mon.
I was just doing these dishes.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.961
Do you have a minute?

04:30.203 --> 04:33.138
I was just about to
take a break anyway.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.331
So listen...

04:37.877 --> 04:40.175
...I know we haven't had
a chance to talk...

04:40.480 --> 04:43.313
...since Emily and l
decided to get married.

04:43.549 --> 04:46.211
And I was just wondering
how you were.

04:47.987 --> 04:52.481
If you were getting married,
I would feel kind of....

04:54.861 --> 04:56.021
You know?

04:56.963 --> 05:01.457
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know...

05:02.368 --> 05:03.392
...I'm okay.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.966
I just wanted to check.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.165
That's sweet. Thank you.

05:10.910 --> 05:11.899
You're great.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.637
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.546
You just hang in there.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.747
"Hang in there"?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.752
No, I didn't mean....

05:25.958 --> 05:30.361
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

05:32.632 --> 05:35.396
I thought you had
just been on four dates.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.468
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.770
Oh no, it has become.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.575
Oh no, those were four great dates.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.278
I mean, and the connection!

05:50.550 --> 05:53.815
Emotionally, mentally.
You know?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.816
Physically.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.724
-That's incredible.
-I know, isn't it?

05:59.959 --> 06:03.451
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.893
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.971
I gotta get back to my dishes.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.604
I gotta get to work.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.605
You know what would
make me happy?

06:22.815 --> 06:24.476
You know, what's that?

06:24.784 --> 06:28.652
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.153
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

06:31.357 --> 06:33.917
Why don't we all
have dinner Sunday night?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.986
That would be great!

06:37.530 --> 06:39.964
All right. It's a date!

06:40.333 --> 06:43.268
"Hang in there."
You hang in there.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.932
-Did you say something?
-No, just singing.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.315
Oh, my God!

06:59.118 --> 07:01.348
Look at this one!

07:01.854 --> 07:03.219
It's so beautiful.

07:05.491 --> 07:09.120
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.460
May I help you ladies?

07:11.664 --> 07:14.155
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.697
What's the name?

07:15.968 --> 07:18.903
-Emily Waltham.
-Yes, I have it right here.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.874
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

07:40.393 --> 07:43.521
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.325
I am, aren't l?

07:48.167 --> 07:49.498
Miss Waltham?

07:50.736 --> 07:51.725
We're closing.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.533
All right.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.176
And could I get my ring back?

08:09.922 --> 08:12.413
All right, buddy.
Time to roll over.

08:19.732 --> 08:22.929
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

08:24.604 --> 08:26.367
And a pajama store!

08:31.377 --> 08:32.935
Does she use the cups?

08:33.212 --> 08:35.373
Yes, I believe she does.

08:36.983 --> 08:40.749
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

08:49.996 --> 08:50.985
Thank you.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.298
Thank you very much.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.229
Thank you for coming.

09:03.075 --> 09:05.669
-Just a second.
-No, no! Let me in!

09:07.179 --> 09:08.407
Can you hold on a minute?

09:08.648 --> 09:11.412
No! You have to
let me in right now!

09:13.085 --> 09:14.074
Are you alone?

09:16.022 --> 09:17.182
All right.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.622
This sucks.

09:27.166 --> 09:31.159
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.801
I'm so tired.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.432
It's six o'clock.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.811
I hear you and Joshua are
going out with Ross and Emily.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.141
I think that's really cool.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.614
I think you're handling
that really well.

09:47.486 --> 09:48.783
"Handling it"?

09:49.221 --> 09:51.314
There's nothing to handle.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.961
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

09:56.195 --> 09:59.028
They're not going to
get married anyway.

09:59.832 --> 10:03.768
They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

10:03.970 --> 10:06.803
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

10:07.006 --> 10:09.736
One of them will realize
what they've done...

10:09.976 --> 10:11.238
...and call it off.

10:11.477 --> 10:14.913
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.172
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

10:17.717 --> 10:18.706
Why not?

10:18.918 --> 10:21.148
Weddings are a great place
to meet women.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.254
When I dance, I look like this.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.598
Hey, man.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.003
What are you doing
four weeks from today?

10:40.239 --> 10:41.467
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.005
I am...

10:45.077 --> 10:46.066
...free.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.105
Because we're getting
married in a month.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.281
-What?
-Yes.

10:53.452 --> 10:54.749
In a month?

10:54.954 --> 10:57.218
-You mean 30 days?
-Yeah.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.347
From now?

10:59.959 --> 11:01.051
That's great!

11:02.528 --> 11:06.362
She always wanted to get married
where her parents did...

11:06.565 --> 11:08.965
...but it's getting torn down.

11:09.235 --> 11:13.035
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

11:13.272 --> 11:14.967
...and it just feels right.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.977
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

11:29.789 --> 11:31.484
This isn't mine.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.467
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.627
What's up?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.441
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.873
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.772
See you and hug you.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.277
See you....

11:57.516 --> 11:58.778
Great!

12:00.453 --> 12:01.613
Sit.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.219
You okay?

12:07.026 --> 12:11.793
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.559
Want to know why?

12:16.602 --> 12:17.694
Do l?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.766
Because I am really happy about us.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.137
I think we are so
on the right track.

12:24.376 --> 12:28.574
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.873
-You know?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.744
We're clicking.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.453
If there was just
one little area where...

12:35.654 --> 12:38.589
...I think we need to work on,
I would think...

12:38.824 --> 12:42.282
...it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

12:43.462 --> 12:47.057
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.959
You know, yeah, you're right.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.897
We have our fun. Yeah?

12:54.974 --> 12:58.535
I mean, like crazy!
You know?

12:59.145 --> 13:02.706
Are you gonna put on
that cheerleader outfit again?

13:02.882 --> 13:05.146
No. You wish.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.449
All right.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.824
This is going to sound, you know,
a little hasty.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.824
But just go with me.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.830
What if we got married?

13:26.438 --> 13:29.999
-What?
-Oh, I know. It's so totally like...

13:30.242 --> 13:33.302
..."Whoa, can we do this?"
You know?

13:33.546 --> 13:36.879
But it just feels right.
Don't you think it does?

13:37.082 --> 13:39.812
I mean, it just feels right.
Don't you...?

13:44.089 --> 13:45.113
Rachel...

13:45.724 --> 13:46.884
...you're...

13:47.660 --> 13:49.184
...a real...

13:49.395 --> 13:51.260
...special lady.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.763
But my divorce isn't final yet...

13:57.002 --> 13:59.163
...and we've been on four dates.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.272
So I'm thinking: No...

14:04.410 --> 14:05.672
...but...

14:06.111 --> 14:07.135
...thanks.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.173
You idiot!

14:16.789 --> 14:18.814
-Your name, please?
-Joey Tribbiani.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.952
Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

14:23.996 --> 14:24.985
Sir?

14:28.133 --> 14:29.532
Yes, he did.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.828
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.871
Check out that girl.
She's really hot.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.345
Yeah, she is.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.184
How you doing?

14:50.422 --> 14:52.117
You looking good.

14:55.261 --> 14:58.822
-What?
-You're coming on to the entire room.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.430
-I'm Chandler.
-I'm Marjorie.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.403
-Do you mind if I sit?
-Please.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.109
So what are you in for?

15:11.310 --> 15:12.800
I talk in my sleep.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.214
What a coincidence!
I listen in my sleep.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.478
So why don't you give me your number?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.288
Are you ready?

15:27.626 --> 15:29.116
I got it! Mine!

15:32.698 --> 15:34.791
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

15:36.135 --> 15:37.227
My turn, my turn!

15:39.672 --> 15:41.264
Okay, ready?

15:50.316 --> 15:52.307
That was a terrible throw!

15:52.551 --> 15:55.179
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

15:56.922 --> 15:59.914
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

16:03.729 --> 16:05.094
Oh, my God!

16:05.898 --> 16:07.763
We're really sad, aren't we?

16:10.736 --> 16:11.998
Yeah, I think we are.

16:13.739 --> 16:15.400
This isn't even my dress.

16:15.674 --> 16:20.668
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late."

16:27.252 --> 16:29.516
-I'm changing out of this.
-Me, too.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.847
In half an hour?

16:32.224 --> 16:33.248
Me, too.

16:34.526 --> 16:37.154
All right, now throw it
straight this time.

16:38.197 --> 16:39.755
I'm getting married!

16:45.904 --> 16:48.202
I hate my regular clothes now.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.236
I look down and I know...

16:51.410 --> 16:54.902
...this won't be the most
special day of my life.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.449
I mean, it was kind of
fun for a while...

16:58.717 --> 17:00.708
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

17:00.919 --> 17:02.216
I guess.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.556
Oh, my God!

17:07.826 --> 17:09.817
You're such a cheater!

17:10.629 --> 17:12.153
Hello, little ones.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.395
-So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
-Yep!

17:15.634 --> 17:18.501
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.470
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, you know, she picked me.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.301
How'd that happen?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.535
Because I'm cooler.

17:28.847 --> 17:29.836
No, seriously.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.712
She's the kind of girl....
Joey was unconscious.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.854
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.056
Oh, my God!

17:43.429 --> 17:44.418
What is that?

17:44.630 --> 17:47.190
They gave it to me
at the sleep clinic...

17:47.433 --> 17:50.129
...and it's going to help me
not to snore.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.371
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

17:54.840 --> 17:57.274
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.374
I know I don't have to.

18:00.212 --> 18:01.611
It tastes good.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.179
Plus, you look cool.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.021
Hope I didn't stretch Emily's dress.

18:15.194 --> 18:18.686
Your butt's not
that much bigger than her's.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.789
I just called Joshua.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.329
How'd it go?

18:23.569 --> 18:26.163
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

18:26.405 --> 18:28.930
...some crazy girl who's
dying to get married.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.903
And I'm going through
a hard time.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.065
What'd he say?

18:32.244 --> 18:36.078
His answering machine
was very understanding.

18:39.084 --> 18:40.847
I feel blue.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.853
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

18:46.091 --> 18:50.050
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.193
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.268
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.334
But as it turns out...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.734
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.168
Yeah, maybe.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.338
And I'm just trying to
figure out why.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.505
Any luck?

19:12.417 --> 19:17.013
You know how Ross and I have
always been on-again, off-again?

19:18.090 --> 19:21.253
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

19:21.493 --> 19:23.427
...we would be on again.

19:23.695 --> 19:24.855
Again.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.529
You know what?
I think we all did.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.540
I got us reservations
for Sunday night.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.441
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

19:42.648 --> 19:45.742
Well, you'd better make it for three.

19:46.485 --> 19:49.818
I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at three.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.122
Three people.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.584
Joshua's not going to be there.

19:56.828 --> 19:57.886
What happened?

19:58.130 --> 20:00.496
Well, I think he broke up with me.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.728
No. Why?

20:04.169 --> 20:06.831
Apparently, he scares easy.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.334
Rachel, I'm sorry.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.938
It's okay.

20:13.412 --> 20:18.349
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.317
Come here.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.955
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?

20:33.599 --> 20:37.035
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I got my girls.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.048
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

21:00.125 --> 21:01.114
What?

21:05.364 --> 21:06.626
I got to tell you...

21:06.832 --> 21:09.733
...this really does put me
in a better mood.

21:11.336 --> 21:15.067
I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.075
Maybe someday there will be.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.078
Chandler's coming by to borrow
candles for his big date.

21:24.316 --> 21:27.114
Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

21:27.319 --> 21:29.310
The groom cannot see the bride.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.419
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.783
Not after this!

21:35.294 --> 21:37.694
Okay guys, just relax.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.957
I do!

21:48.407 --> 21:49.897
I got to go.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.341
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.716
Food's here. Fair enough.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.852
Fifteen-minute warning.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.289
Late.

22:24.976 --> 22:28.673
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
