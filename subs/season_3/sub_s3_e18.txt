WEBVTT

00:08.544 --> 00:09.977
What's so funny?

00:10.212 --> 00:14.911
Nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

00:19.355 --> 00:21.949
What? What's so funny?

00:24.059 --> 00:27.790
No, no. There's none of that in here.

00:27.963 --> 00:31.694
Come on, man. At least let me
finish this last one.

00:31.867 --> 00:33.767
Only if you give me a drag.

00:35.304 --> 00:36.771
Okay.

00:42.478 --> 00:45.936
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

00:49.051 --> 00:51.918
No, why don't you hold on to that one.

01:00.729 --> 01:03.721
Okay, that's like
the least fun game ever.

01:03.899 --> 01:06.800
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something...

01:07.036 --> 01:10.028
...that is going to help you quit.

01:16.145 --> 01:18.978
Nope. That patch is no good.

01:22.151 --> 01:23.743
It's a hypnosis tape.

01:23.986 --> 01:27.683
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

01:30.759 --> 01:31.748
What's your problem?

01:32.328 --> 01:36.321
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

01:37.599 --> 01:40.295
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

01:40.502 --> 01:42.936
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

01:43.138 --> 01:47.165
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

01:49.011 --> 01:51.070
I was trying to distract attention...

01:51.246 --> 01:56.183
...from that poor, old woman who was
trying to stuff her breasts into tube socks.

01:56.352 --> 01:57.717
Forget hypnosis.

01:57.886 --> 02:01.549
The way to quit smoking is to
dance naked in a field of heather...

02:01.724 --> 02:05.455
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy, young men.

02:05.995 --> 02:09.590
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night."

02:10.299 --> 02:12.460
The One With the Hypnosis Tape

02:58.514 --> 03:01.677
- Here you go.
- I didn't want cinnamon on this.

03:02.484 --> 03:04.042
Sorry.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.920
- Hi.
- Oh, my God! Frank!

03:15.497 --> 03:16.623
How are you?

03:16.899 --> 03:18.560
What are you doing here?

03:18.801 --> 03:21.497
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

03:21.737 --> 03:25.935
And then my mom locked me out
of the house, so I couldn't find it.

03:26.341 --> 03:30.744
Then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

03:32.347 --> 03:33.939
What happened?

03:34.983 --> 03:36.575
Vandalism.

03:37.753 --> 03:40.586
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

03:41.123 --> 03:45.253
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

03:45.527 --> 03:47.859
- You're getting married?
- Oh, yeah!

03:50.299 --> 03:53.427
My little brother's getting married!

03:53.602 --> 03:57.834
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Do you wanna meet her?

03:58.107 --> 03:59.267
Do I?

03:59.708 --> 04:00.936
Do you?

04:01.944 --> 04:02.968
Yeah, I do.

04:03.212 --> 04:07.205
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

04:07.382 --> 04:12.376
- I gonna go get my fiancee, man!
- All right.

04:13.288 --> 04:17.782
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.587
Isn't it fantastic?

04:19.895 --> 04:22.955
Don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

04:23.198 --> 04:24.222
Well, he's 18.

04:24.399 --> 04:27.926
It'll be illegal for him to drink
at his own bachelor party.

04:28.537 --> 04:30.971
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

04:31.740 --> 04:34.004
Always illegal, Joe.

04:35.611 --> 04:39.103
Hey, this is my fiancee...

04:39.281 --> 04:41.272
...Mrs. Knight.

04:43.385 --> 04:46.047
- That's my sister.
- You know, it's funny.

04:46.255 --> 04:50.453
Frank told me so much about you, but
you're not how I pictured you at all.

04:51.093 --> 04:53.493
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

04:53.662 --> 04:55.323
- Here, you go.
- Thank you.

04:55.497 --> 04:56.691
Here, grab a seat.

04:56.932 --> 04:59.492
So how did you guys meet?

04:59.668 --> 05:02.466
Well, I was in Mrs. Knight's...

05:02.638 --> 05:06.597
I mean, Alice. Sorry, Alice.
I always do that.

05:08.710 --> 05:12.271
- I was in her home-ec class.
- He was my best student.

05:12.514 --> 05:15.642
Yeah. She was my best teacher.

05:24.293 --> 05:27.160
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

05:29.698 --> 05:32.360
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

05:32.534 --> 05:37.699
Yeah. We talked about
just living together...

05:38.974 --> 05:40.942
...but we want kids right away.

05:43.378 --> 05:45.608
Oh, my God!

05:45.781 --> 05:47.305
Great!

05:48.817 --> 05:52.014
Kids. Frank, are you sure
you're ready for that?

05:52.454 --> 05:54.012
How hard can it be?

05:54.289 --> 05:58.658
You know, I mean, it's babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

05:59.861 --> 06:02.193
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

06:02.397 --> 06:05.798
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

06:05.968 --> 06:08.163
- Yeah.
- Right?

06:09.905 --> 06:13.807
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

06:13.976 --> 06:16.638
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

06:16.812 --> 06:21.249
Oh, no, but when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

06:27.389 --> 06:30.085
You are falling fast asleep.

06:30.425 --> 06:33.087
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

06:33.595 --> 06:35.995
You are now completely asleep.

06:36.231 --> 06:38.426
You don't need to smoke.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.260
Cigarettes don't control you.

06:41.570 --> 06:44.664
You are a strong, confident woman...

06:44.940 --> 06:47.408
...who does not need to smoke.

06:47.676 --> 06:51.612
A strong, confident woman.

06:52.881 --> 06:53.870
You know what?

06:54.049 --> 06:58.110
I realized in the last year I've
only gone out with Richard and Julio.

06:58.620 --> 07:01.919
You gotta help me out, set me up.
Get me back in the game.

07:02.124 --> 07:03.148
Not a problem.

07:03.425 --> 07:07.555
I work in fashion, and all I meet
are eligible straight men.

07:09.931 --> 07:11.523
Can I get you something else?

07:11.700 --> 07:15.397
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

07:15.570 --> 07:18.801
- Haven't we covered that topic?
- You just said to her...

07:19.041 --> 07:20.736
You wanna go out with me...

07:20.909 --> 07:24.208
...because of my wig, boobs,
and because I serve you food.

07:24.446 --> 07:28.212
Well, if that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

07:28.817 --> 07:32.514
And the two times we went out,
it was just plain awkward.

07:33.021 --> 07:36.422
Come on. You think she should
go out with me, don't you?

07:37.092 --> 07:41.529
Well, I mean, are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

07:41.730 --> 07:44.756
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning.

07:44.933 --> 07:49.597
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

07:51.073 --> 07:53.667
- I mean, think about it.
- Oh, I will.

07:56.511 --> 08:01.539
No, I know. I know that
this is Frank's life. You know.

08:01.717 --> 08:05.175
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

08:06.588 --> 08:08.579
What, is it the age thing?

08:08.757 --> 08:10.418
I'm fine with the age thing...

08:10.592 --> 08:14.426
...until it sticks its tongue
down my little brother's throat.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.356
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

08:18.533 --> 08:22.196
You think he'll enjoy it when he's
up to his elbows in diapers...

08:22.404 --> 08:25.771
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

08:26.108 --> 08:30.101
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

08:30.278 --> 08:32.906
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.579
Well, have you told him how you feel?

08:37.753 --> 08:40.688
Yes. Not out loud.

08:41.356 --> 08:44.553
- Pheebs, he's not a mind reader.
- We don't know that.

08:46.094 --> 08:50.428
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

08:50.599 --> 08:54.330
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

08:54.503 --> 08:58.872
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

08:59.741 --> 09:02.232
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.504
No, no, no, no.

09:04.679 --> 09:07.773
Come on, you guys.

09:08.183 --> 09:10.947
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

09:11.186 --> 09:14.917
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

09:16.425 --> 09:18.188
- No.
- No.

09:19.027 --> 09:21.996
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

09:23.632 --> 09:26.965
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

09:27.235 --> 09:30.398
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?

09:30.572 --> 09:34.064
And then you say, "Let's just
hang out at your place."

09:34.342 --> 09:37.573
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

09:38.547 --> 09:40.981
I think you should
go out with this guy.

09:41.183 --> 09:42.980
He doesn't do anything for me.

09:43.185 --> 09:47.383
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

09:47.556 --> 09:52.493
Well, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids.

09:52.661 --> 09:55.391
- All right, I get your point.
- All right.

09:55.564 --> 09:56.929
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:57.098 --> 10:00.158
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

10:00.335 --> 10:02.895
I just carry it around.

10:04.239 --> 10:06.605
- You got any Chap Stick?
- Yeah.

10:06.775 --> 10:11.109
- How are those tapes working out?
- Good. I haven't smoked yet today.

10:11.379 --> 10:15.748
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

10:19.087 --> 10:20.850
Thank you.

10:21.022 --> 10:22.455
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:22.624 --> 10:27.561
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

10:27.796 --> 10:29.696
That check thing was adorable.

10:29.865 --> 10:31.526
What check thing?

10:31.700 --> 10:36.865
As a joke, this customer who has
a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip.

10:37.038 --> 10:39.768
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

10:40.041 --> 10:42.601
Pete Becker. Pete...

10:49.117 --> 10:50.641
Is this him?

10:50.819 --> 10:53.117
That's Bill Clinton.

10:54.222 --> 10:56.349
Who's he hugging?

10:57.559 --> 11:01.325
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

11:01.596 --> 11:03.291
This guy invented Moss 865.

11:03.498 --> 11:05.989
Every office in the world
uses that program.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.692
- We use it!
- There you go!

11:09.604 --> 11:12.300
Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

11:12.841 --> 11:16.140
- I'm not gonna go out with him.
- Why not? He's a millionaire.

11:18.380 --> 11:23.511
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is a real
$20,000 check. This is so exciting.

11:23.685 --> 11:27.212
- Or incredibly offensive.
- Yeah, sure. That too.

11:40.201 --> 11:41.725
What?

11:43.271 --> 11:46.104
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

11:46.274 --> 11:50.404
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay? She's 44.

11:50.879 --> 11:54.872
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

11:56.217 --> 11:59.050
What? You don't think I know that?

11:59.854 --> 12:02.379
All right, I'm gonna go play basketball.

12:02.557 --> 12:04.957
Or let the really good guys
use my ball...

12:05.126 --> 12:07.094
...while I say, "Can I play?"

12:11.900 --> 12:14.494
Joe, you left your keys in the door.

12:14.669 --> 12:16.034
Here you go.

12:24.546 --> 12:26.707
The point is...

12:26.881 --> 12:29.975
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

12:30.251 --> 12:33.220
He's right. He's right.
This is your time.

12:33.455 --> 12:37.391
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

12:37.559 --> 12:41.893
Isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

12:42.364 --> 12:45.356
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

12:45.533 --> 12:49.060
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

12:49.237 --> 12:55.005
- You don't have it anymore?
- No. I slept with someone else.

12:55.243 --> 12:58.269
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

12:59.948 --> 13:01.973
It didn't.

13:02.617 --> 13:06.383
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

13:06.554 --> 13:09.819
- Now, what is that like?
- It's so cool, man.

13:10.091 --> 13:14.391
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

13:16.097 --> 13:19.123
- Why can't I find that?
- I had it and I blew it.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.928
- Well, I want it!
- You can have it.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.604
Maybe there's something
wrong with me.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.806
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

13:29.844 --> 13:32.335
- Then, you hold on to it!
- All right, man!

13:32.514 --> 13:35.347
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

13:35.984 --> 13:37.645
You're Frank's best man?

13:40.255 --> 13:43.850
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

13:44.025 --> 13:45.993
What about you, huh?

13:46.628 --> 13:47.959
I'm the ring bearer.

14:05.046 --> 14:10.382
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real home-ec emergency.

14:10.552 --> 14:13.749
- Oh, my God. Who died on this?
- Yeah, I know.

14:13.922 --> 14:16.720
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."

14:17.125 --> 14:18.114
Can you help?

14:18.460 --> 14:22.658
Absolutely. First, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

14:22.831 --> 14:26.096
- Then if that doesn't work...
- Forget it. It's ruined.

14:26.267 --> 14:29.828
Never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

14:30.004 --> 14:33.531
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

14:34.409 --> 14:38.402
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother Frank?

14:42.684 --> 14:45.585
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

14:45.754 --> 14:48.917
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

14:51.059 --> 14:53.186
You have a Monica Geller here.

14:53.361 --> 14:55.261
Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

14:56.331 --> 14:57.662
Hi.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.458
What the hell is this?

15:00.869 --> 15:03.838
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

15:04.005 --> 15:05.597
You got it.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.066
- I'm sorry. What?
- What is this supposed to mean?

15:09.244 --> 15:12.509
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

15:14.215 --> 15:17.616
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

15:19.788 --> 15:23.622
Are you buying me? Is this the way
you get girls to go out with you?

15:23.792 --> 15:26.727
I'm still here.

15:29.164 --> 15:32.395
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip...

15:32.567 --> 15:35.900
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

15:36.070 --> 15:39.198
...and there wouldn't be
this heat between us.

15:39.641 --> 15:44.135
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

15:44.312 --> 15:46.803
You were the chef
and I was the customer.

15:46.981 --> 15:50.417
But now we're, like,
this couple that fights.

15:51.753 --> 15:53.812
You're a loon.

15:53.988 --> 15:57.947
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

15:58.193 --> 16:00.821
I think you're great.

16:01.095 --> 16:02.653
Come on, what do you say?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.599
I don't know.

16:06.768 --> 16:08.531
Why not?

16:09.037 --> 16:12.564
Because I don't wanna encourage
this kind of behavior.

16:12.740 --> 16:17.006
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

16:17.178 --> 16:18.770
We go out, we eat.

16:18.947 --> 16:22.974
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

16:33.061 --> 16:35.188
- Hi.
- No!

16:35.363 --> 16:38.491
Wait, no. Just put
the mail down. It's me.

16:39.801 --> 16:43.100
Sorry. Why were you
just, like, all in the dark?

16:43.271 --> 16:48.368
Well, your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

16:48.543 --> 16:50.636
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, sure.

16:50.812 --> 16:52.541
So how was your day?

16:52.714 --> 16:57.014
Well, just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.718
What happened?

17:01.890 --> 17:05.417
Alice... She called it off.

17:05.593 --> 17:07.527
Oh, no.

17:09.497 --> 17:12.523
Did she say why?

17:12.700 --> 17:14.759
No. Just that I was too young.

17:14.936 --> 17:17.700
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young...

17:17.872 --> 17:21.467
...because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

17:23.044 --> 17:25.410
Yeah, yeah. No. I don't...

17:25.580 --> 17:30.449
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

17:30.618 --> 17:34.213
Well, yeah, if the best is,
like, unbelievable pain.

17:34.689 --> 17:37.021
Oh, sweetie.

17:37.191 --> 17:39.989
You know, I was just finally happy.

17:40.328 --> 17:43.229
For the first time in my life...

17:43.398 --> 17:45.491
...after my dad left me...

17:45.667 --> 17:50.969
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

17:51.139 --> 17:54.802
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

17:56.044 --> 17:59.536
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

17:59.714 --> 18:04.651
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

18:04.953 --> 18:10.357
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

18:11.426 --> 18:15.863
Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

18:16.230 --> 18:19.825
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

18:21.936 --> 18:23.335
What?

18:23.504 --> 18:26.598
I kind of had a little chat
with Alice...

18:26.774 --> 18:29.971
...and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

18:30.144 --> 18:33.511
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

18:33.681 --> 18:36.172
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

18:36.584 --> 18:37.778
Okay...

18:37.952 --> 18:40.614
My mother didn't want us
to be together...

18:40.788 --> 18:44.952
...but the worst thing she ever did
was tie me to the porch.

18:46.194 --> 18:52.258
You know, I came to you because
I thought you'd understand. Oh, no!

18:52.667 --> 18:54.259
You know...

18:54.869 --> 18:56.928
...I would storm out of here...

18:57.105 --> 19:01.667
...if I had some money
or a place to go.

19:07.181 --> 19:10.412
Ross, if you had a million dollars,
what's the first thing you'd buy?

19:10.752 --> 19:13.983
I'd get some municipal bonds,
put the rest in the bank...

19:14.155 --> 19:15.622
...and live off the interest.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.355
Well...

19:17.525 --> 19:19.618
...we've heard from Dr. Fun.

19:22.130 --> 19:26.089
- Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!
- Oh, my God!

19:30.004 --> 19:32.564
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

19:32.740 --> 19:37.541
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

19:39.213 --> 19:41.147
I know.

19:41.315 --> 19:43.977
Okay, then get the lobster.

19:47.889 --> 19:48.878
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.685
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:52.527 --> 19:55.052
How much cash you got
in your pocket now?

19:57.665 --> 20:01.328
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

20:01.502 --> 20:04.903
Why not? Hey, come in for a drink.

20:05.306 --> 20:07.866
- Where do you wanna go?
- You like pizza?

20:08.042 --> 20:11.068
- That sounds great.
- I know a great little place.

20:17.185 --> 20:19.244
You're not paying for the pizza.

20:19.420 --> 20:23.379
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

20:23.624 --> 20:25.524
Is that enough lira?

20:25.693 --> 20:27.752
I'd throw another 1000 on that.

20:27.929 --> 20:30.329
- How much is that?
- That's about 60 cents.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.506
Every night!

20:45.646 --> 20:47.841
You don't need to smoke.

20:48.049 --> 20:50.711
Cigarettes don't control you.

20:50.885 --> 20:54.719
You are a strong, confident woman...

20:54.889 --> 20:57.483
...who does not need to smoke.

20:57.658 --> 21:00.889
A strong, confident woman...

21:01.062 --> 21:03.622
...who does not need to smoke.

21:10.605 --> 21:13.597
So can I.

21:18.479 --> 21:20.470
Hey, Frank.

21:21.382 --> 21:25.216
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

21:25.386 --> 21:26.910
But I so didn't.

21:28.055 --> 21:32.458
There's someone here who can
explain this better than I can.

21:36.531 --> 21:38.158
Hi, Frank.

21:41.369 --> 21:44.827
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.938
Phoebe's right, Frank.

21:50.111 --> 21:53.808
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.710
I was being selfish.

21:55.883 --> 21:59.216
Even though we want
the same things right now...

21:59.387 --> 22:03.756
...in the future, we may not.

22:03.925 --> 22:06.621
- Is that what it is?
- Yes, but not just that.

22:06.794 --> 22:07.988
Not just that.

22:11.632 --> 22:17.468
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

22:17.638 --> 22:19.128
...nonetheless...

22:21.509 --> 22:24.273
- Nonetheless.
- Nonetheless.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.976
You're too young...

22:31.152 --> 22:34.519
...to really know what you want.

22:34.689 --> 22:37.419
That's right, exactly.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.359
All right, that's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

22:43.464 --> 22:45.591
Bye-bye.

22:45.967 --> 22:50.768
But no, the important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

22:50.938 --> 22:53.634
This is clearly wrong.

22:54.709 --> 22:57.234
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

22:57.979 --> 23:01.005
Okay, can I just get my purse?
I'm sorry.

23:01.182 --> 23:03.980
Okay, all right, good.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.655
Cigarettes don't control you.

23:09.824 --> 23:12.884
You are a strong, confident woman...

23:13.060 --> 23:16.621
...who does not need to smoke.

23:17.932 --> 23:21.299
Joey's your best friend.

23:21.469 --> 23:26.839
You wanna make him
a cheese sandwich every day.

23:28.209 --> 23:31.610
You wanna buy him hundreds
of dollars' worth of pants.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.272
