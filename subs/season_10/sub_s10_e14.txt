WEBVTT

00:02.510 --> 00:04.229
Thank you guys for having us over.

00:04.391 --> 00:07.751
- Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
- I don't know why we don't hang out...

00:07.915 --> 00:10.955
...with married couples more often.
- Because every time we do...

00:11.118 --> 00:14.193
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.

00:15.282 --> 00:19.040
You mean that Portuguese couple?
Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.

00:20.928 --> 00:23.525
Hey, you guys, I have great news.

00:23.731 --> 00:28.571
- We're kind of in the middle of dinner.
- Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.971
Guess what happened at work today.

00:32.179 --> 00:34.616
A dinosaur died a million years ago?

00:34.822 --> 00:38.614
Try 65 million years ago.
And then try:

00:40.067 --> 00:44.941
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.

00:45.352 --> 00:48.233
Yeah, do you have any idea what this
means in academic circles?

00:48.395 --> 00:50.593
I am gonna get laid.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.638
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

00:54.802 --> 00:56.077
Oh, Italian.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.721
No one...
No one wanted seconds, right?

00:58.926 --> 01:00.155
No, I'm good.

01:00.848 --> 01:03.729
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.

01:03.891 --> 01:07.683
I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci.
Gucci wants me.

01:07.895 --> 01:09.728
- I'm up for tenure.
- Congratulations.

01:09.897 --> 01:12.698
You too. What are the odds?

01:12.900 --> 01:14.334
Guess what?

01:15.062 --> 01:18.296
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.621
I don't know who I'm happiest for.

01:21.829 --> 01:24.391
I do. He's been working on that all day.

02:15.202 --> 02:18.915
Hey, Mon, was it weird
changing your name to Geller Bing?

02:19.166 --> 02:22.685
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.247
- Where'd you go to do it?
- The...

02:25.412 --> 02:28.168
The Ministry of Names...

02:29.657 --> 02:30.886
...Bureau.

02:31.699 --> 02:33.099
You never did it.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.497
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of...

02:35.663 --> 02:38.304
Of being an official Bing.

02:39.787 --> 02:42.257
Hey, I will have you know that...

02:42.429 --> 02:46.346
Who am I kidding? Let's call the kid
Geller and let Bing die with me.

02:47.715 --> 02:48.944
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:49.116 --> 02:51.348
Honey, would you want me to
take your name?

02:51.519 --> 02:54.639
Oh, it's up to you. It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.358
- Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
- Mrs. Hannigan?

02:57.525 --> 03:00.325
Can't you see I'm
in the middle of something?

03:01.529 --> 03:02.929
I like it.

03:04.131 --> 03:06.010
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Joe.

03:06.173 --> 03:09.054
We got things to check out
at the new house. You want to come?

03:09.216 --> 03:11.972
- No, thank you.
- You're not happy about us moving...

03:12.139 --> 03:14.531
...but you're the only one
who hasn't seen the house.

03:14.702 --> 03:16.820
Yeah, come with us.
You'll see how close it is.

03:17.024 --> 03:19.746
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.

03:19.907 --> 03:21.979
I couldn't even find that on the map.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.752
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.

03:30.638 --> 03:33.519
You know what? You are my friends.
I want to be supportive.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.035
I will come with you.
Shotgun.

03:35.242 --> 03:36.518
Damn it.

03:36.804 --> 03:38.797
See you guys later.
We'll pick you up at 11.

03:38.966 --> 03:40.924
- So glad you're coming.
- All right.

03:41.849 --> 03:45.242
- Good for you. That was really mature.
- What? The only reason I'm going...

03:45.412 --> 03:48.567
...to their stupid house is to point
out everything wrong with it...

03:48.736 --> 03:51.298
...so they don't move.
I'm gonna make them stay here.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.015
You're a strange kind of grownup.

03:55.663 --> 03:58.783
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't want to do.

03:58.946 --> 04:03.945
Believe me. There's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed, and...

04:04.111 --> 04:08.188
- Can we not talk about that now?
- All right. Prude.

04:09.957 --> 04:12.154
Look, Monica and Chandler
really love this house.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.517
You are not gonna talk them
into staying here.

04:14.682 --> 04:17.278
Hey, I can convince people
to do anything, you know?

04:17.444 --> 04:20.484
I bet I could even get Mike
to do that thing. What is it?

04:23.410 --> 04:26.052
I am not gonna help you do that!

04:26.213 --> 04:28.171
Oh, my God.

04:34.181 --> 04:38.178
Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Campbell,
with Gucci.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.306
The reservation's probably under Gucci.

04:41.509 --> 04:44.389
It's spelled like "gucky,"
which can be confusing.

04:45.392 --> 04:49.025
Mr. Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.555
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
You have to seat us somewhere else.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.835
I'm sorry, that's always
Mr. Campbell's table.

04:58.005 --> 05:01.843
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.

05:02.049 --> 05:04.042
I know. With "gucky."

05:06.534 --> 05:10.291
- Rachel?
- I'm on a date.

05:10.858 --> 05:12.691
That's great.

05:12.900 --> 05:16.293
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough.
Single mom. Career.

05:16.463 --> 05:18.980
You gotta get out there.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.580
Well, you've got a good energy.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.025
- Rachel?
- Yes, hi.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.592
- James Campbell.
- Hi.

05:25.753 --> 05:28.223
- Excuse us.
- Please.

05:30.477 --> 05:32.276
He's cute.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.590
So...

05:34.762 --> 05:37.073
...your resume is quite impressive.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.160
My resume?

05:41.328 --> 05:46.487
I wouldn't... I wouldn't call
my online dating profile a resume.

05:46.694 --> 05:49.894
Dating profile? No, I'm...
I'm talking about the work resume.

05:53.501 --> 05:56.974
Whatever happened to just singing
for no reason?

05:58.225 --> 06:00.788
Maybe people found it weird.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.229
So...

06:04.752 --> 06:07.588
- Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
- What?

06:07.755 --> 06:09.348
- I don't.
- You don't?

06:09.517 --> 06:11.315
No, I love... I love it there.

06:11.519 --> 06:14.514
Well, if you don't want to leave,
why are we having this lunch?

06:17.124 --> 06:18.798
What?

06:20.648 --> 06:22.002
That's Hugo Boss?

06:28.856 --> 06:33.092
This place is so depressing.
If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.

06:36.343 --> 06:38.415
But you obviously haven't.

06:39.787 --> 06:42.509
- How can I help you?
- I need to change my name, please.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.188
See, I need to change it
because I'm hiding from the law.

06:48.516 --> 06:50.075
You're fun.

06:50.277 --> 06:53.192
- You need to fill out this form.
- Okay. Well, just so I know...

06:53.360 --> 06:55.593
I don't know how it works.
My name is Buffay...

06:55.763 --> 06:57.482
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.

06:57.645 --> 07:00.560
So is it supposed to be
"Buffay-Hannigan" or "Hannigan-Buffay"?

07:00.768 --> 07:03.238
- It can be anything you want.
- Well, not anything.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.688
Yeah. Anything.

07:06.854 --> 07:09.576
Oh, this could take a while.

07:10.938 --> 07:13.295
- Get out of my line.
- Okay.

07:17.545 --> 07:18.899
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

07:19.066 --> 07:21.583
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.

07:21.789 --> 07:25.148
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
- Wrong again.

07:27.034 --> 07:28.947
Apparently, you can change it
to anything.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.031
So I thought, "All right, here's an
opportunity to be creative."

07:32.199 --> 07:35.798
So meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

07:42.449 --> 07:44.248
That's what we were
gonna name the baby.

07:46.774 --> 07:50.167
- Phoebe.
- Princess Consuela.

07:50.658 --> 07:52.935
You seriously changed
your name to that?

07:53.100 --> 07:56.140
Okay, so from now on, we have to call
you Princess Consuela?

07:56.343 --> 07:59.338
No, I'm gonna have my friends
call me Valerie.

08:03.310 --> 08:06.545
- Hey, how did the interview go?
- Not good.

08:06.714 --> 08:10.631
I always feel that way after an interview.
I'll bet it went better than you think.

08:10.798 --> 08:15.478
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.

08:15.683 --> 08:17.801
That is a bad interview.

08:18.005 --> 08:20.362
What are you talking about?
How did this happen?

08:20.528 --> 08:24.319
My boss was at the same restaurant
where I was having my interview...

08:24.491 --> 08:25.892
...and he heard everything.

08:26.053 --> 08:29.732
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...

08:29.897 --> 08:31.456
...because I'm not a team player.

08:31.619 --> 08:33.497
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."

08:33.701 --> 08:36.058
And then I had to sit there
for 45 minutes...

08:36.223 --> 08:40.619
...while he proved that
that, in fact, was true.

08:41.709 --> 08:43.428
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

08:44.912 --> 08:46.187
Hey.

08:46.353 --> 08:49.348
What...? What's this?

08:49.517 --> 08:53.354
Why, it's a bottle of champagne.
Why is this here?

08:53.561 --> 08:55.234
- Ross.
- I guess it's here...

08:55.402 --> 08:56.917
...because I got tenure!

08:57.124 --> 08:58.878
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

08:59.086 --> 09:02.206
This is the single greatest day
of my professional career.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.402
- Gunther. Six glasses.
- Six?

09:04.612 --> 09:07.971
- You want me to join you?
- I thought Joey was here. Five is good.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.419
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey
in my coffee tomorrow.

09:15.743 --> 09:17.815
Israeli champagne.

09:17.985 --> 09:20.103
And it's vanilla.

09:20.668 --> 09:23.230
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.467
Hey, Rach, so how did your thing go?

09:26.674 --> 09:29.474
Good. But I won't hear about that
for a couple days.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.677
Oh, you know what,
you're gonna get it. I can feel it.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.439
Can you?

09:34.922 --> 09:36.801
All right, everybody, here's to Ross.

09:36.964 --> 09:41.280
And to years of hard work
finally paying off.

09:41.448 --> 09:45.240
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.

09:45.733 --> 09:49.126
But also knowing it means a lot.

09:50.097 --> 09:52.660
But more importantly, to full,
well-rounded lives.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.499
That center around work.

09:54.782 --> 09:56.615
- To Ross.
- To Ross.

10:00.748 --> 10:03.823
You know what the best part
about this is? I can never be fired.

10:04.031 --> 10:05.351
- Oh, God.
- No, seriously.

10:05.553 --> 10:07.750
I have job security for life.

10:07.915 --> 10:10.192
You know?
I mean, I never have to worry.

10:10.397 --> 10:13.598
Oh, look at you.
Look how happy you are for me.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.278
No, it's not that. I got fired today.

10:19.446 --> 10:21.599
And I didn't get the other job.

10:25.172 --> 10:27.643
Rach, I'm so sorry.

10:27.815 --> 10:31.413
- Great, I feel like an idiot.
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.020
Little heads-up would've been nice.

10:43.831 --> 10:45.903
Thank you for letting us see
the house again.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.505
And thank you for explaining
to us what escrow means.

10:48.676 --> 10:51.591
I've already forgotten what you said,
but thank you.

10:51.799 --> 10:54.714
Take as long as you want.
Just let me know when you're through.

10:57.364 --> 11:00.519
- So glad you decided to come.
- Me, too. Yeah, this place is great.

11:00.688 --> 11:05.208
So happy for you guys. Although,
you know, I hope you like fungus.

11:06.574 --> 11:07.928
- What?
- Fungus.

11:08.095 --> 11:09.815
Yeah. Place is full of it.

11:10.297 --> 11:13.417
No, it's not. We had an inspection
and they didn't find anything.

11:13.621 --> 11:17.014
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.

11:17.224 --> 11:20.185
Maybe it's because you hung your head
out the window like a dog...

11:20.347 --> 11:22.305
...the whole ride here.

11:23.310 --> 11:25.030
Maybe.

11:25.232 --> 11:28.865
So this is the living room, huh?
It's pretty dark.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.832
- No, it's not.
- Are you kidding?

11:35.042 --> 11:37.478
I think I just saw a bat
in the corner.

11:38.125 --> 11:42.281
When your head was hanging out the
window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

11:43.571 --> 11:44.800
Maybe.

11:46.013 --> 11:49.213
Look, I just think you guys can
do better than this house, you know?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.255
Or any other house for that matter.

11:51.418 --> 11:52.648
Oh, Joey.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.290
We know you're having a hard
time with this, but we...

11:55.462 --> 11:58.104
- We love it here.
- Fine! If you love this house so much...

11:58.265 --> 12:02.228
...you should live here. Okay? I hope you
get used to that weird humming sound.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.508
- Joey, we know that's you.
- No...

12:06.674 --> 12:08.472
...it's not.

12:14.121 --> 12:15.681
- Welcome back.
- I missed you.

12:15.843 --> 12:17.563
- Oh, me too.
- So, what's new?

12:17.765 --> 12:20.122
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.

12:20.327 --> 12:22.685
- That's great. You changed your name?
- Yes, I did.

12:22.890 --> 12:26.773
Meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

12:28.295 --> 12:30.288
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.

12:30.497 --> 12:32.410
- You really did that?
- Yep.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.652
You can't do that.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.097
Why?

12:36.263 --> 12:39.463
Why? It's fun. It's different.
No one else has a name like it.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.622
Then I'm gonna change my name.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.908
Great. Okay, what are
you gonna change it to?

12:45.472 --> 12:46.907
Crap Bag.

12:48.556 --> 12:51.995
- Mike Crap Bag?
- No. No "Mike." No, just "Crap Bag."

12:52.159 --> 12:55.074
First name: Crap. Last name: Bag.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.761
- You're not serious, right?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

12:57.925 --> 13:01.000
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.

13:01.529 --> 13:04.968
Well, then great.
If you love it, I love it.

13:05.172 --> 13:07.973
I do love it. And I love your name.
I love Princess Consuela.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.412
And I love Crap.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.147
- Who are you?
- Oh, hi. I'm Joey.

13:22.309 --> 13:25.110
My stupid friends are buying
this house. Who are you?

13:25.312 --> 13:28.991
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are
selling this house.

13:30.998 --> 13:32.752
I hate my parents.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.157
I hate my friends.

13:37.805 --> 13:41.084
Look, there's gotta be a way
that we can stop this from happening.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.769
Like what?

13:44.772 --> 13:48.530
Okay, you come with me and you
tell them that the house is haunted.

13:48.736 --> 13:50.729
What are you, 8?

13:53.581 --> 13:57.054
- Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
- I don't have any great ideas.

13:57.224 --> 13:59.376
I am 8.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.507
There's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know...

14:03.671 --> 14:06.871
...if Monica and Chandler move here,
and Phoebe's married to Mike...

14:07.034 --> 14:10.587
...that just leaves me and Ross
and Rach. You know what I mean?

14:11.078 --> 14:12.559
I really don't.

14:13.801 --> 14:16.876
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.

14:17.084 --> 14:20.204
- My parents say I'll make new friends.
- Yeah, sure, easy for you.

14:20.367 --> 14:23.009
You're young.
Me? I'm set in my ways.

14:24.772 --> 14:28.484
This is what my mom was talking about.
Whiners are wieners.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.615
Look, you want your friends
to be happy, right?

14:35.783 --> 14:38.219
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

14:38.425 --> 14:42.503
Well, if moving here is gonna make them
happy, don't you want them to do it?

14:42.990 --> 14:45.553
Yeah. Maybe.

14:46.554 --> 14:48.466
Then you've gotta let them go.

14:53.521 --> 14:55.878
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're...

14:56.043 --> 14:58.320
You're probably right.

14:58.886 --> 15:00.560
How'd you get to be so smart?

15:01.609 --> 15:02.838
I read a lot.

15:04.451 --> 15:06.684
Just when I thought we could be friends.

15:10.457 --> 15:13.418
Oh, hey, Rach.
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.340
Oh, thank you...

15:16.103 --> 15:18.300
You still don't know my name, do you?

15:19.186 --> 15:21.065
Well, now I don't have to.

15:24.952 --> 15:28.186
Ross, what is taking you so long?

15:35.482 --> 15:39.719
I'm sorry. It's almost as if this wasn't
built for a quick getaway.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.883
Rachel?

15:44.331 --> 15:47.007
Mark? Oh, my God.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.574
- How have you been?
- Fantastic. You remember Ross.

15:50.738 --> 15:52.491
Sure. Sure.

15:52.980 --> 15:54.334
What's with the chair?

15:56.584 --> 16:00.341
You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so...

16:01.589 --> 16:03.308
Clever.

16:03.470 --> 16:04.700
So how are you?

16:04.872 --> 16:07.229
You're not catching me
on my best day.

16:07.394 --> 16:10.309
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff
doesn't say "big promotion."

16:10.477 --> 16:13.996
No, but it's good. You know,
I'm gonna take some time off...

16:14.161 --> 16:16.074
...and do charity work.
- Are you sure?

16:16.243 --> 16:17.997
We may have something
at Louis Vuitton.

16:18.205 --> 16:20.563
Screw charity work.
What do you got?

16:20.768 --> 16:22.522
Why don't we have dinner and talk?

16:22.810 --> 16:25.406
- Great. I'll call you.
- Okay.

16:25.573 --> 16:28.169
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.

16:33.981 --> 16:35.210
Oh, my God.

16:35.382 --> 16:38.104
See? I told you something
good would come along.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.066
And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?

16:41.228 --> 16:43.186
Ross, that's Mark.

16:43.350 --> 16:47.108
From Bloomingdale's?
You were insanely jealous of him.

16:47.314 --> 16:49.068
- That is Mark?
- Yes.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.597
I hate that guy.

16:51.679 --> 16:54.241
No, no, no.
You cannot go to dinner with him.

16:54.441 --> 16:57.960
- What? You don't want me to get a job?
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.958
Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."

17:00.928 --> 17:03.239
I'm serious.
I just don't trust that guy, okay?

17:03.410 --> 17:06.645
You know what...? Okay, let's talk
about it later. There comes security.

17:17.825 --> 17:19.579
Oh, I love this street.

17:19.747 --> 17:24.381
The trees and the big front yards
and the actual picket fences.

17:24.592 --> 17:27.108
Man, those two dogs are going at it.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.912
- Hey. Where you been?
- Oh, just, you know, looking around.

17:34.081 --> 17:35.562
But you know what?

17:35.723 --> 17:37.875
This house is great.

17:38.085 --> 17:39.759
Really? What changed your mind?

17:39.967 --> 17:43.520
The little girl who lives here made me
feel better about the whole thing.

17:43.971 --> 17:48.127
Joey? There was a little girl who lived
here, but she died, like, 30 years ago.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.615
What?

17:55.583 --> 17:57.815
I'm just messing with you.

17:58.546 --> 18:02.258
That's not funny.
You know I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.

18:02.670 --> 18:05.870
Now that you're okay with the house,
do you want to go see your room?

18:06.594 --> 18:07.823
What?

18:07.995 --> 18:09.224
I get my own room?

18:10.037 --> 18:13.237
You don't think we'd buy a house
and not have a Joey room, do you?

18:14.001 --> 18:15.755
Oh, my God.

18:18.766 --> 18:21.920
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?

18:23.410 --> 18:27.089
- No.
- Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

18:29.937 --> 18:31.850
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.

18:32.059 --> 18:33.413
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

18:35.743 --> 18:37.302
- Oh, hi, Rita.
- How are you?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.457
Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.

18:39.627 --> 18:41.107
Yeah.

18:41.268 --> 18:42.942
Why don't you introduce me?

18:45.392 --> 18:47.625
Rita, this is my husband.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.427
Why don't you tell her my name?

18:51.078 --> 18:55.713
Okay, I will. This is...
This is my husband, Crap Bag.

18:57.565 --> 18:58.794
Crap Bag?

18:59.006 --> 19:02.889
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.966
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

19:10.898 --> 19:14.861
Okay, fine, you made your point. Can
you please just be Mike Hannigan again?

19:15.062 --> 19:16.543
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

19:18.145 --> 19:20.901
How about...?
How about Buffay-Hannigan?

19:21.068 --> 19:22.058
Really?

19:22.229 --> 19:25.862
Yeah. I'm Phoebe
Buffay-Hannigan-Bananahammock.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.913
Do you even know what
a banana hammock is?

19:30.317 --> 19:31.832
It's a funny word.

19:32.039 --> 19:33.679
It's a Speedo.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.204
Oh, crap.

19:42.810 --> 19:45.406
- Hey, is Rachel here?
- Nope.

19:45.573 --> 19:47.166
She's still at dinner?

19:47.374 --> 19:49.686
- I guess. Why, who's she with?
- That guy, Mark...

19:49.857 --> 19:52.852
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.

19:53.020 --> 19:55.058
But I know he really wants
to sleep with her.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.904
It's seven years ago.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.342
My time machine works.

20:02.670 --> 20:06.188
We ran into him on the street today,
and he said he might have a job for her.

20:06.353 --> 20:08.950
But I know he just wants
to get into her pants.

20:09.597 --> 20:13.479
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.

20:14.001 --> 20:15.355
Excuse me?

20:15.763 --> 20:17.117
Oh, please.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.721
Yesterday, on the subway,
you couldn't stop staring...

20:19.887 --> 20:21.641
...at that woman with the big breasts.

20:21.849 --> 20:24.365
For your information,
I was staring at her baby.

20:24.532 --> 20:26.489
We're about to be parents.

20:27.334 --> 20:29.167
Oh, sorry.

20:38.706 --> 20:41.667
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi. So...

20:41.829 --> 20:45.222
...how was dinner?
- Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.

20:45.392 --> 20:49.025
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why? What
could that smarmy letch possibly want?

20:49.196 --> 20:54.321
Oh, Ross. Come on. He is happily
married. His wife just had twins.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.516
Should we send something?

20:57.805 --> 20:59.478
How did the job stuff go?

21:00.608 --> 21:01.962
He offered me one.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.203
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

21:05.372 --> 21:07.171
I know, it's amazing.

21:07.374 --> 21:11.132
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.

21:11.298 --> 21:13.610
- The money is great.
- Can we...?

21:13.781 --> 21:18.097
Can we just stop for a second? Who said
something better would come along?

21:18.265 --> 21:21.465
You didn't believe me. I told
you everything was gonna work out.

21:21.669 --> 21:24.664
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israel's finest.

21:28.556 --> 21:31.118
The job is in Paris.

21:43.651 --> 21:46.451
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...

21:46.614 --> 21:48.367
...but am I missing opportunities?

21:48.576 --> 21:51.297
You know, I've always thought
of myself as a serious actor.

21:51.458 --> 21:54.134
Should I be trying
to do more independent movies?

21:54.341 --> 21:56.254
I don't know.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.026
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.

22:00.187 --> 22:02.180
Hold on.

22:02.870 --> 22:06.070
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.

22:08.516 --> 22:10.509
