00:03.181 --> 00:04.808
Hey, guys.

00:05.584 --> 00:08.815
So, what do you think?

00:10.088 --> 00:11.282
-About what?
-What?

00:12.391 --> 00:15.918
Are you kidding?
Okay, I'II give you a hint.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.631
Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.

00:21.833 --> 00:23.562
ChandIer's eyes!

00:24.770 --> 00:26.465
I got gIasses.

00:26.705 --> 00:29.071
You aIways had gIasses.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.468
No, I didn't.

00:34.846 --> 00:36.279
Are you sure?

00:37.816 --> 00:39.283
Didn't you have a pair?

00:39.484 --> 00:43.716
They were reaIIy round and burgundy,
and they made you Iook kind of....

00:43.956 --> 00:45.924
-Feminine.
-Yes!

00:46.291 --> 00:47.315
No.

00:47.526 --> 00:50.324
I think the gIasses Iook great.
You Iook se<i>x</i>y.

00:50.596 --> 00:52.029
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

00:52.264 --> 00:54.357
You didn't think I wore gIasses?

00:54.600 --> 00:56.158
Of course.

01:00.038 --> 01:02.268
The One With Phoebe's Cookies

01:50.722 --> 01:52.849
What do you want for
an engagement gift?

01:53.091 --> 01:55.116
That's okay, we're not
having a party...

01:55.394 --> 01:57.294
...so you don't have to get us--

01:58.230 --> 02:02.291
If someone wants to give us a present,
we can't deprive them of that joy.

02:03.301 --> 02:05.792
You shouId get them a
IittIe CD pIayer.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.266
I aIready have one.

02:07.506 --> 02:10.737
UnIess someone borrowed it and
Ieft it at the gynecoIogist.

02:13.945 --> 02:17.403
Yeah, and by ''someone''
she means Joey.

02:18.817 --> 02:20.114
I know what I want!

02:20.385 --> 02:23.149
-What we want, honey.
-No, you don't want this.

02:24.156 --> 02:26.818
I want your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

02:27.059 --> 02:29.391
You mean the chocoIate chip
cookie recipe?

02:30.662 --> 02:32.960
The one my grandma
made me swear on her deathbed...

02:33.231 --> 02:35.893
...that I wouId never
Iet out of our famiIy?

02:36.668 --> 02:39.728
Dying peopIe say the craziest things.

02:41.273 --> 02:44.640
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my chiIdren.

02:45.777 --> 02:48.302
Break my heart. Oh, aII right.

02:48.580 --> 02:52.072
I'II be the mom who makes the
worId's best chocoIate chip cookies.

02:52.317 --> 02:55.582
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

02:57.556 --> 02:59.080
Ahoy!

02:59.291 --> 03:01.953
-How's the boat?
-I'm getting into this saiIing stuff.

03:02.194 --> 03:04.094
You finaIIy took it out of the marina?

03:04.663 --> 03:06.130
Why wouId I do that?

03:06.832 --> 03:09.699
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

03:10.502 --> 03:12.629
If you don't saiI it,
what do you do on it?

03:12.838 --> 03:14.635
It's a great pIace to just sit...

03:14.873 --> 03:18.331
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

03:19.878 --> 03:23.143
It's good that you finaIIy
have a pIace to do that.

03:23.949 --> 03:26.213
I couId teach you to saiI if you want.

03:26.451 --> 03:28.715
-You couId?
-I've been saiIing my whoIe Iife.

03:28.987 --> 03:32.013
When I was 1 5, my dad
bought me my own boat.

03:33.525 --> 03:35.652
-Your own boat?
-He was trying to cheer me up.

03:35.861 --> 03:37.522
My pony was sick.

03:49.107 --> 03:51.234
-You know what I was thinking?
-What?

03:51.710 --> 03:53.803
Nothing, I just Iike to go Iike this.

03:55.714 --> 03:58.114
-What are you doing tonight?
-Do you have a Iecture?

03:58.350 --> 04:01.513
-No, why?
-Then, free as a bird. What's up?

04:01.820 --> 04:04.550
My dad wants to know if you want
to pIay rac<i>q</i>uetbaII.

04:04.756 --> 04:06.519
Great! Dad must Iike you!

04:06.725 --> 04:08.420
He doesn't ask just anyone to pIay.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.890
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for ''Chauncey.''

04:11.129 --> 04:13.393
I assumed he meant you.

04:14.032 --> 04:15.499
Did you correct him?

04:15.734 --> 04:18.259
No, I thought it wouId be
more fun this way.

04:19.738 --> 04:22.172
CooI! Maybe you couId
do this every week.

04:22.407 --> 04:23.669
Or you couId sit on the porch...

04:23.909 --> 04:26.036
...and make sure no one
steaIs the trashcans.

04:26.645 --> 04:28.772
He does that every week too.

04:30.148 --> 04:33.948
Just so you know, you have to Iet
him win. He hates to Iose.

04:34.219 --> 04:36.585
Maybe I'II pIay with my Ieft hand.

04:37.756 --> 04:39.087
You're not a Iefty?

04:40.525 --> 04:42.220
Does anybody know me?

04:47.265 --> 04:48.254
What's wrong?

04:48.533 --> 04:51.900
I went to my oId apartment
to get the cookie recipe...

04:52.103 --> 04:54.594
...and that stupid fire burned it up!

04:54.806 --> 04:58.674
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof bo<i>x</i>...

04:58.910 --> 05:01.902
...and keep it at Ieast 1 00 yards
away from the originaI?

05:07.485 --> 05:10.215
Because I'm normaI.

05:11.990 --> 05:14.550
That was the one Iegacy
my grandmother Ieft me.

05:14.793 --> 05:17.591
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

05:17.796 --> 05:19.957
We have to get you
an engagement present?

05:20.932 --> 05:22.194
Don't worry about it.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.925
No one got me an engagement present.

05:25.637 --> 05:29.095
I don't have the recipe, but here.

05:29.341 --> 05:31.775
I wish you heaIth
and happiness.

05:32.744 --> 05:34.507
An oId cookie?

05:35.814 --> 05:38.282
This is what happens when you
don't register for gifts.

05:39.584 --> 05:44.283
I made a batch and froze it.
This is the onIy one Ieft.

05:44.489 --> 05:45.751
We can't accept this.

05:45.957 --> 05:46.946
Why not?

05:47.926 --> 05:49.951
Because it's gross.

05:50.662 --> 05:53.927
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

05:54.132 --> 05:55.827
I do this at work aII the time.

05:56.101 --> 05:57.227
-ReaIIy?
-I think so!

06:02.240 --> 06:04.037
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.642
Two! I've been engaged twice.

06:15.987 --> 06:17.113
Look at this cIown.

06:17.355 --> 06:20.620
He thinks he can take up the
whoIe river.

06:20.859 --> 06:23.521
Get out of the way, jackass!

06:25.297 --> 06:27.959
Who names their boat
<i>Coast Guard,</i> anyway?

06:30.669 --> 06:32.364
That is the Coast Guard.

06:32.570 --> 06:33.662
What are they doing here?

06:33.905 --> 06:36.066
The coast is aII the way over there.

06:36.975 --> 06:38.465
Joey, just ignore the boats.

06:38.677 --> 06:40.907
-We're not finished with our Iesson.
-AII right.

06:41.146 --> 06:43.341
I'm gonna go over the basic
points once more.

06:43.581 --> 06:45.549
Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?

06:45.817 --> 06:47.512
I want to go over there...

06:47.719 --> 06:50.017
...where that boatIoad of girIs is.

06:52.023 --> 06:54.048
Is that it? You want to give...

06:54.292 --> 06:56.283
...a shout out to the hot <i>chicas</i>?

06:56.494 --> 06:58.485
Okay, Iet's do that, SaiIor Joe.

06:58.730 --> 07:01.858
Quick <i>q</i>uestion, though:
What's this caIIed?

07:03.168 --> 07:06.331
-Boat rope?
-Wrong!

07:06.538 --> 07:08.369
How do you get the mainsaiI up?

07:09.407 --> 07:11.307
Rub it?

07:14.512 --> 07:17.948
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

07:18.216 --> 07:21.083
I say, ''Come again?''

07:21.586 --> 07:23.315
I know this one. I know this one.

07:25.590 --> 07:27.353
Time's up. Now you're dead.

07:27.592 --> 07:28.820
And deaf!

07:29.027 --> 07:30.961
You go on and make your IittIe jokes.

07:31.196 --> 07:32.686
If you don't know
what you're doing...

07:32.931 --> 07:36.196
...you wiII die.
Am I getting through to you?

07:37.635 --> 07:39.262
-Yes.
-Don't just say yes.

07:39.471 --> 07:41.962
This isn't a game.
You couId get hurt out here!

07:42.240 --> 07:45.038
Do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

07:48.380 --> 07:51.110
I want to make a
ship-to-shore caII to ChandIer.

08:00.592 --> 08:03.390
-I definiteIy taste nutmeg.
-You do?

08:03.595 --> 08:06.063
You don't? WeII, that's
the difference...

08:06.264 --> 08:08.425
...between a
professionaI and a Iayman.

08:10.101 --> 08:11.796
That and arrogance.

08:13.972 --> 08:14.996
Hey.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.764
Hey. How was saiIing?

08:17.475 --> 08:19.466
I don't want to taIk about it.

08:20.145 --> 08:22.409
You couId've at Ieast saved
me a cookie.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.443
Women are mean!

08:33.191 --> 08:34.419
I can't beIieve that.

08:34.626 --> 08:37.993
Now the onIy thing Ieft
of my grandmother's Iegacy is...

08:38.196 --> 08:39.754
...this crumb.

08:41.666 --> 08:44.533
I wish you a Iong and happy marriage.

08:47.639 --> 08:49.436
-Hey.
-How was it?

08:49.641 --> 08:52.201
WeII, I had a great time.

08:52.477 --> 08:54.809
Chauncey, on the other hand....

08:55.013 --> 08:57.004
I wiII teII the story.

08:57.282 --> 09:00.342
It was going great.
I Iet him win, we were bonding...

09:00.618 --> 09:02.449
...he even said I couId caII him Dad.

09:02.687 --> 09:04.450
And what did he ask you
not to caII him?

09:05.657 --> 09:06.851
Daddy.

09:08.026 --> 09:09.994
Look, here's the story.

09:10.862 --> 09:15.356
<i>We had just finished playing,</i>
<i>and we were gonna take a steam.</i>

09:15.633 --> 09:16.657
<i>I walk into the room...</i>

09:16.868 --> 09:18.927
<i>...and it's really steamy.</i>

09:21.506 --> 09:24.669
<i>So I take off my glasses,</i>
<i>and that's when it happened.</i>

09:24.876 --> 09:25.934
Guys?

09:26.244 --> 09:29.042
-Over here.
-Have a seat, son.

09:34.319 --> 09:35.308
Hey!

09:42.627 --> 09:45.562
-Oh, my God! I can't beIieve it.
-I know.

09:45.797 --> 09:48.265
You gave my father a Iap dance.

09:51.669 --> 09:54.194
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

09:55.773 --> 10:00.506
Because otherwise they'd
have to caII it the ''room'' room.

10:02.013 --> 10:06.074
Why?
Why did that have to happen?

10:06.885 --> 10:08.512
Come on, it's not that big a deaI.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.086
Not that big a deaI?

10:11.356 --> 10:13.722
There was touching of things.

10:13.925 --> 10:16.086
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...

10:16.327 --> 10:19.490
...but did you have to bond
to that part?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.495
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

10:24.736 --> 10:26.226
He probabIy thought it was funny.

10:26.504 --> 10:28.233
He'II be teIIing this story for years.

10:28.439 --> 10:31.237
I don't want him to teII
this story for years.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.841
Oh, but he wiII.

10:34.679 --> 10:38.740
He stiII teIIs the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

10:40.585 --> 10:41.711
I wasn't escaping.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.184
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

10:45.356 --> 10:47.051
I was trying to heIp out a s<i>q</i>uirreI.

10:47.258 --> 10:49.055
You were trying to eat it.

10:52.463 --> 10:55.227
If that is your father caIIing
to teII this story...

10:55.433 --> 10:57.196
...then the marriage is off!

10:57.702 --> 10:59.761
Come on. HeIIo.

11:00.471 --> 11:02.837
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

11:03.074 --> 11:04.974
I'II caII you Iater, Dad.
I Iove you.

11:11.783 --> 11:13.250
I'm off to see your dad.

11:14.085 --> 11:15.484
Aren't you a IittIe overdressed?

11:17.455 --> 11:20.947
You better make sure
he tips you this time.

11:22.060 --> 11:25.359
I figured I wouId try to convince
him not to teII the story anymore...

11:25.597 --> 11:28.464
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

11:28.733 --> 11:31.224
And by ''face,'' I don't mean his Iap.

11:31.469 --> 11:34.302
And by ''face,'' I don't mean my ass.

11:37.108 --> 11:39.906
Are you getting Monica and
ChandIer a present?

11:40.111 --> 11:42.477
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.307
Thank you!

11:46.384 --> 11:47.442
Hey.

11:47.952 --> 11:49.180
WeII, heIIo.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.287
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

11:53.458 --> 11:56.689
I don't know the boat way
to say this, but never!

11:58.630 --> 11:59.654
Why not?

11:59.897 --> 12:02.263
Because you're mean on the boat.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.697
I was just trying to teach you.

12:04.936 --> 12:07.336
WeII, Iesson Iearned.
RacheI is mean.

12:08.306 --> 12:11.434
Yep, yep, yep.

12:12.543 --> 12:14.670
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.811
She wouIdn't Iet me heIp at aII.

12:17.015 --> 12:18.983
E<i>x</i>cuse me, I wanted you to heIp.

12:19.217 --> 12:20.411
But you couIdn't move...

12:20.652 --> 12:23.621
...because you were wearing
three Iife jackets.

12:24.856 --> 12:27.689
You have to respect the sea.

12:29.227 --> 12:31.923
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

12:32.163 --> 12:34.188
But I teII you, that was not mean.

12:34.465 --> 12:38.333
My father is mean. He used to aIways
yeII at me on the boat.

12:38.569 --> 12:41.663
It was horribIe.
I was being a reaIIy good teacher.

12:41.873 --> 12:44.740
Does a good teacher say,
''Put down the beer, pinhead!''

12:45.510 --> 12:49.002
Does a good student drink seven beers
during his first Iesson?

12:49.547 --> 12:50.741
Si<i>x</i> and a haIf.

12:51.316 --> 12:53.250
You knocked the Iast
one out of my hand, remember?

12:53.484 --> 12:55.384
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

12:55.586 --> 12:56.951
WeII, it hit me anyway.

12:57.188 --> 13:00.351
It wouId have hurt a Iot Iess
if I had finished that Iast beer.

13:01.359 --> 13:06.490
I'm sorry. I wiII try to tone it down
and stop yeIIing.

13:07.198 --> 13:08.563
No bossing me around?

13:08.833 --> 13:10.562
-I won't boss you around.
-And be nice?

13:10.768 --> 13:12.463
-I'II be nice.
-You'II be topIess?

13:13.538 --> 13:16.029
-Joey!
-You want me to Iearn?

13:21.579 --> 13:25.481
Here's batch 22.
Maybe these are Iike your grandma's.

13:25.717 --> 13:28.584
This has a bit of orange peeI,
but no nutmeg.

13:28.853 --> 13:30.480
Let's give it a shot.

13:30.855 --> 13:33.415
I haven't made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

13:33.624 --> 13:35.216
What for, a bake saIe?

13:35.426 --> 13:37.360
No, just a Friday night.

13:43.034 --> 13:44.296
These are pretty good.

13:44.535 --> 13:46.435
Yeah, but not as good as batch 1 7.

13:46.637 --> 13:47.695
Which one was that?

13:47.905 --> 13:50.032
The ones we had after
you aImost threw up.

13:51.075 --> 13:53.202
Oh, yeah, batch 1 7 was good.

13:53.444 --> 13:56.538
I did not Iike batch 1 6.

13:58.049 --> 13:59.641
I'm okay.

14:00.818 --> 14:04.117
Any more from the good batch?
We couId work off those.

14:04.322 --> 14:07.780
I think there's one Ieft.

14:12.230 --> 14:15.722
Batch 1 6.
Si<i>x</i>teen, peopIe, get out of the way!

14:23.107 --> 14:26.975
Okay, Joey. You're doing reaIIy good.

14:27.178 --> 14:29.339
I just need you
to step to the portside.

14:34.685 --> 14:37.176
Remember taIking about the portside?

14:37.422 --> 14:38.946
Oh, yeah.

14:39.157 --> 14:40.317
No.

14:41.959 --> 14:45.690
It's Ieft, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.329
Why not just say Ieft?

14:47.565 --> 14:49.294
Okay, go to the Ieft.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.637
The Ieft.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.864
Just sit over there!

14:57.108 --> 14:59.269
You're yeIIing again. See that?

14:59.477 --> 15:03.436
Oh, no, no. Very <i>q</i>uiet.
Said with Iove, no yeIIing.

15:05.883 --> 15:10.582
You know what? Since I'm here,
I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.

15:11.889 --> 15:13.584
See what I did there?

15:17.395 --> 15:20.330
We're Iuffing a IittIe.
Can you tighten up the Cunningham?

15:20.965 --> 15:24.628
You just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.532
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

15:27.805 --> 15:29.705
We did that when that bird...

15:29.974 --> 15:31.999
...fIew over with the fish
in his mouth.

15:32.243 --> 15:33.904
Did you see it? It was gross.

15:34.145 --> 15:36.204
I did not see the bird or the fish!

15:36.481 --> 15:39.507
I did not see the piece of
Styrofoam shaped Iike Mike Tyson!

15:41.385 --> 15:44.980
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to saiI a boat.

15:45.223 --> 15:48.021
Which obviousIy is
an impossibIe thing to do.

15:48.226 --> 15:51.320
You're yeIIing, and I don't
see you taking your top off.

15:51.562 --> 15:53.052
I <i>q</i>uit!

15:53.998 --> 15:57.126
-What do you mean? You can't <i>q</i>uit.
-Why not?

15:57.335 --> 16:00.236
You're not finished! I won't have it.
Greens do not <i>q</i>uit.

16:01.205 --> 16:02.866
Greens?

16:03.174 --> 16:06.200
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis <i>q</i>uit.

16:09.514 --> 16:10.708
Oh, my God.

16:10.948 --> 16:13.917
I just said, ''Greens don't <i>q</i>uit,''
didn't I?

16:14.151 --> 16:15.413
Did I say, ''Greens don't <i>q</i>uit''?

16:15.653 --> 16:18.679
Yes! And you're stiII yeIIing at me.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.859
No, I'm not yeIIing at you.
I'm just yeIIing near you.

16:22.059 --> 16:23.924
Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.

16:24.195 --> 16:26.857
Oh, my God. This is horribIe.

16:27.965 --> 16:31.867
I try so hard not to be my mother,
I didn't see this coming.

16:35.206 --> 16:39.575
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to Iearn.

16:44.448 --> 16:45.813
I did Iearn.

16:46.050 --> 16:49.451
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, come on.

16:49.687 --> 16:51.211
It's okay.

16:51.422 --> 16:53.322
I know what a mainsaiI is.

16:53.991 --> 16:57.927
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

16:59.697 --> 17:01.221
-I know port is right.
-Left.

17:01.432 --> 17:02.729
Damn it!

17:06.003 --> 17:08.437
What are we gonna do
with aII these cookies?

17:09.407 --> 17:10.704
Joey.

17:11.776 --> 17:14.244
It wouId make my grandmother happy...

17:14.445 --> 17:17.380
...that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

17:17.615 --> 17:22.075
I bet she's Iooking up at us
and smiIing right now.

17:23.654 --> 17:25.519
Looking up?

17:25.723 --> 17:30.319
She was reaIIy nice to me,
but she's in heII for sure.

17:32.163 --> 17:33.289
WeII, I've tried everything.

17:33.564 --> 17:35.259
I give up.
I'm not gonna be the mom...

17:35.533 --> 17:37.160
...who makes the worId's
best cookies.

17:37.768 --> 17:42.603
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoIi raab.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.034
Kids Iove that, right?

17:46.611 --> 17:49.671
Isn't there any reIative
that has the recipe?

17:49.947 --> 17:51.414
What about your sister?

17:51.616 --> 17:54.449
No. I made a promise to
myseIf that the ne<i>x</i>t time...

17:54.652 --> 17:57.780
...I wouId taIk to UrsuIa
is over my dead body.

17:59.190 --> 18:03.820
And that's not happening
tiII October 1 5, 2032.

18:04.095 --> 18:06.325
That's the day you're gonna die?

18:06.597 --> 18:08.656
I've got shuffIeboard that day.

18:10.267 --> 18:11.256
That's what you think.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.807
What about friends of your grandma?
WouIdn't they have the recipe?

18:19.010 --> 18:23.106
I may have reIatives in France
who wouId know.

18:23.314 --> 18:28.377
My grandmother said she got it from
her grandmother, ''NestIey TouIouse.''

18:30.287 --> 18:31.276
What was her name?

18:32.023 --> 18:34.685
NestIey TouIouse.

18:36.527 --> 18:38.859
NestIé ToII House?

18:44.135 --> 18:46.797
You Americans aIways butcher
the French Ianguage.

18:48.739 --> 18:51.230
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

18:53.744 --> 18:55.143
Yes!

18:58.249 --> 18:59.409
Oh.

19:00.017 --> 19:01.814
I cannot beIieve that I spent...

19:02.019 --> 19:04.146
...two days figuring out that recipe.

19:04.388 --> 19:05.821
It was here the whoIe time!

19:06.023 --> 19:09.925
I know! You see,
it is stuff Iike this...

19:10.194 --> 19:12.662
...which is why
you're burning in heII!

19:17.001 --> 19:17.990
<i>So you understand.</i>

19:18.202 --> 19:20.762
I'd feeI better if you
didn't teII what happened.

19:21.005 --> 19:23.838
I'm a IittIe embarrassed about it.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.009
I understand compIeteIy.

19:26.243 --> 19:29.940
Nothing's scarier than embarrassing
yourseIf in front of your in-Iaws.

19:30.214 --> 19:34.412
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unempIoyed.

19:34.652 --> 19:36.916
Her father asked me
what I did for a Iiving.

19:37.154 --> 19:38.917
I said I was a Iawyer.

19:39.356 --> 19:41.586
-What'd you do when they found out?
-They never did.

19:41.792 --> 19:45.592
So if you ever see me giving them
IegaI advice, just nod aIong.

19:47.064 --> 19:48.292
ShaII we?

20:03.414 --> 20:06.247
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

20:17.595 --> 20:20.860
WeII, Joey, I hate to admit it...

20:21.065 --> 20:23.590
...your way of saiIing
is a Iot more fun.

20:26.237 --> 20:29.434
Why don't you give a puII
on that rope?

20:29.707 --> 20:30.765
We're not saiIing.

20:31.041 --> 20:34.204
-Just puII on it.
-AII right.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.641
Sandwiches!

20:40.885 --> 20:42.443
What eIse?

20:43.587 --> 20:45.020
Here you go.

20:45.389 --> 20:47.380
-Thank you.
-Oh, wow.

20:51.095 --> 20:52.892
-What are you doing?
-Sorry.

20:53.130 --> 20:56.429
Not Iike that. You're Ietting
aII the good stuff faII out.

20:56.734 --> 21:00.602
CarefuI!
You're wasting good pastrami!

21:03.474 --> 21:06.170
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!

21:12.550 --> 21:13.539
