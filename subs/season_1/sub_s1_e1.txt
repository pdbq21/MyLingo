WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:05.059
The One Where It All Began (Pilot)

00:55.422 --> 00:59.256
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.586
Come on, You are going out with the guy.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.389
There has to be something
wrong with him.

01:04.597 --> 01:06.656
All right, Joey.
Be nice.

01:06.833 --> 01:09.358
So does he have a hump,
a hump and a hairpiece?

01:11.171 --> 01:13.605
Wait, does he eat chalk?

01:13.773 --> 01:17.072
Just cause I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl.

01:17.243 --> 01:21.339
Okay, everybody relax.
Relax. This is not even a date.

01:21.514 --> 01:25.883
It's not. It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

01:26.119 --> 01:29.213
Sounds like a date to me.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.491
All right, so I'm back in high school,
standing in the middle of cafeteria..

01:33.660 --> 01:36.891
and I realize I'm totally naked.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.758
I've had that dream.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.757
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone..

01:44.104 --> 01:46.197
there.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.704
- Instead of
- That's right!

01:50.110 --> 01:51.441
Never had that one.

01:51.611 --> 01:56.207
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

01:56.416 --> 01:59.408
Now I don't know what to do?
Everybody starts looking at me.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.179
They weren't looking at you before?

02:03.156 --> 02:06.922
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.927
And it turns out it's my mother.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.090
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.604
Hi.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.472
This guys says "Hello",
I want to kill myself.

02:28.581 --> 02:29.639
Are you okay, sweety?

02:30.550 --> 02:35.214
I just feel like someone reached down my throat and
grabbed my small intestine and pulled it out of my mouth..

02:35.421 --> 02:39.858
- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.954
Carol moved her stuff out today.

02:43.129 --> 02:46.394
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

02:49.769 --> 02:54.866
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

02:55.074 --> 02:59.704
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

03:00.113 --> 03:03.674
- I'll be fine. All right? Really everyone, I hope she'll be very happy.
- No, you don't.

03:03.883 --> 03:07.284
No, I don't.
To hell with her. She left me!

03:07.487 --> 03:10.251
You never knew she was a lesbian?

03:13.593 --> 03:15.584
No! Okay?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.797
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

03:20.366 --> 03:23.893
She didn't know.
How should I know?

03:24.938 --> 03:28.897
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.670
Did I say that out loud?

03:33.913 --> 03:37.747
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it pretty well.

03:37.951 --> 03:38.940
Oh, really?

03:39.152 --> 03:42.781
So that hysterical phone call
I got from a woman sobbing at 3 AM..

03:42.989 --> 03:47.619
"I'll never have grandchildren,"
"I'll never have grandchildren,"
was what? A wrong number?

03:47.860 --> 03:48.849
Sorry.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.862
All right, Ross, look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.694
You're angry.
You're hurting.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.132
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

03:58.304 --> 03:59.601
Strip joints!

04:01.741 --> 04:04.141
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.541
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

04:07.747 --> 04:11.274
I just want to be married again.

04:15.455 --> 04:19.084
And I just want a million dollars!

04:22.729 --> 04:26.426
- Rachel?
- Oh, god, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

04:26.833 --> 04:28.664
I just went to your building
and you weren't there..

04:28.835 --> 04:32.601
and then this guy with a big hammer
said you might be here, and you are.
You are!

04:32.772 --> 04:36.674
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.744
Ok, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.541
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe..

04:43.716 --> 04:45.911
and Joey.
And remember my brother, Ross?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.313
- Sure!
- Hey!

04:57.230 --> 05:01.894
So you want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

05:03.102 --> 05:07.903
Oh, god, well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

05:08.107 --> 05:10.769
I was in this room
where we would keep all the presents..

05:10.977 --> 05:16.677
and I was looking at this gravy boat.
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.510
When all of a sudden I realised

05:18.718 --> 05:19.912
Sweet 'N Low?

05:22.288 --> 05:26.190
I realized that I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

05:26.392 --> 05:29.259
And then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

05:29.462 --> 05:32.260
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

05:32.932 --> 05:36.368
I always knew
he looked familiar, but..

05:38.738 --> 05:42.139
Anyway I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering..

05:42.342 --> 05:46.005
"Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing this for?"

05:46.212 --> 05:50.114
So anyway I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I we've kind of drifted apart..

05:50.783 --> 05:53.616
but you're the only person
I know who lived here in this city.

05:53.786 --> 05:59.156
- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
- Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

06:15.641 --> 06:20.544
All right, I'm guessing he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.774
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"

06:25.318 --> 06:30.017
"I'll have whatever
Christina's having."

06:30.223 --> 06:33.522
Daddy, I just
I can't marry him.

06:34.026 --> 06:38.929
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.

06:39.132 --> 06:43.159
Well, it matters to me!

06:44.771 --> 06:50.300
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

06:51.310 --> 06:54.802
She should not be
wearing those pants.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.675
I say push her down the stairs!

06:57.183 --> 07:00.050
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

07:04.323 --> 07:06.951
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

07:07.560 --> 07:11.792
It's like all of my life, everyone has
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

07:11.998 --> 07:14.432
"You're a shoe!"

07:14.600 --> 07:17.626
And then suddenly I just stopped and I said
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

07:17.870 --> 07:20.896
What if I want to be a purse?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.735
You know, or a hat?

07:24.076 --> 07:26.476
No, I don't want you to buy me a hat!
I'm saying I am a hat!

07:26.712 --> 07:29.977
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

07:30.616 --> 07:34.074
You can see where he'd have trouble.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.719
Look, Daddy,
it's my life.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.653
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.097
I guess we've established
she's staying here with Monica.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.899
Well, maybe that's my decision.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.299
Maybe I don't need your money.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.707
Wait! Wait, I said maybe!

08:04.917 --> 08:07.784
Ok, Just breathe. Breathe, that's it.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.445
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

08:10.756 --> 08:14.248
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

08:14.694 --> 08:18.858
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

08:19.699 --> 08:23.396
La la la something
And noodles with string

08:23.936 --> 08:25.665
I'm all better now.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.100
I helped.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.710
Ok, look. This is probably for the best, you know.

08:34.480 --> 08:39.144
Independence. Taking control of your life.
The whole hat thing.

08:39.318 --> 08:43.448
And hey. You need anything, you can always come to Joey.

08:43.656 --> 08:47.251
Me and Chandler live right across the hall.
He's away a lot.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.723
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.261
Like there's a rule, or something?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.702
I got it.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.431
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.267
It's Paul.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.936
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.583
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy Paul?

09:11.784 --> 09:12.773
Maybe.

09:12.952 --> 09:16.285
Wait a minute, Your "not a real date" tonight is with Paul,
the wine guy?

09:16.455 --> 09:18.946
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes!

09:19.158 --> 09:21.626
Oh, this is a "Dear Diary" moment.

09:21.827 --> 09:25.263
- Rach wait, I can cancel.
- Oh god, please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

09:26.666 --> 09:30.067
Ross, are you okay?
I mean, do you want me to stay?

09:30.269 --> 09:32.965
That would be good.

09:34.206 --> 09:38.199
- Really?
- No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

09:38.778 --> 09:41.008
What does it mean?
Does he sell it, drink it?

09:41.213 --> 09:43.977
Or he just complains a lot?

09:44.183 --> 09:46.515
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is..

09:47.720 --> 09:50.245
everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.792
- Oh.
- The wine guy.
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul was it?

09:57.496 --> 10:00.624
Ok, I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go

10:00.833 --> 10:03.199
A-wandering?

10:03.402 --> 10:04.733
Change.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.371
Ok, sit down.
Two seconds.

10:11.277 --> 10:15.577
Oh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.752
Hey, Paul, here's a little tip.

10:21.921 --> 10:26.517
She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot
over and over and over again..

10:26.726 --> 10:29.559
until it starts to get a little red.

10:29.762 --> 10:33.095
Shut up, Joey!

10:33.599 --> 10:35.726
So Rachel, what are you up to tonight?

10:36.502 --> 10:40.233
I was kind of supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon..

10:40.506 --> 10:42.838
so, nothing.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.270
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.415
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.948
Talk about your..

10:53.285 --> 10:56.584
big lizards.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.955
Anyway If you don't feel
like being alone tonight..

11:02.128 --> 11:05.689
Joey and Chandler are coming over
to help me put together my new furniture.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.298
Yes, we're very excited about it.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.731
Ross, so thanks. But I think I'm just
going to hang out here tonight.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.996
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure, okay. Sure.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.568
Phoebe, wanna help?

11:16.008 --> 11:19.705
Oh, I wish I could,
but I don't want to.

11:27.720 --> 11:33.681
Love is sweet as summer showers
Love is a wondrous work of art

11:34.060 --> 11:39.657
But your love
Oh, your love, your love

11:39.865 --> 11:44.268
Is like a giant pigeon

11:44.470 --> 11:48.133
Crapping on my heart

11:50.609 --> 11:52.509
Thank you.

12:01.187 --> 12:05.317
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things..

12:05.524 --> 12:08.322
using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

12:09.762 --> 12:14.324
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever..

12:14.533 --> 12:17.331
and I cannot feel my legs.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.537
- I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
- It's a beautiful thing.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.442
What's this?

12:26.612 --> 12:31.675
I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

12:32.051 --> 12:36.147
- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.321
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.691
This was Carol's favorite beer.

12:48.634 --> 12:52.536
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

12:55.975 --> 13:01.174
- You gonna start with that stuff, we're out of here.
- Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.779
Let me ask you a question.

13:02.982 --> 13:07.316
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.351
What did you get?

13:09.555 --> 13:12.649
- You guys.
- Oh, god... Oh my god.
- You got screwed.

13:12.825 --> 13:17.421
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

13:17.630 --> 13:22.192
I guess I should've caught on when she started
going to the dentist four and five times a week.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.733
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

13:24.937 --> 13:27.269
My brother is going through that, right now.
He's such a mess.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.997
How did you get through it?

13:29.275 --> 13:32.733
He might try accidentally
breaking something valuable of hers.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.539
- Say her
- Leg?

13:34.747 --> 13:38.649
That's one way of doing it.
Me, I went for the watch.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.810
You actually broke her watch?

13:42.021 --> 13:46.253
The worst thing I ever did was I've shredded
my old boyfriend's favorite bath towel.

13:46.458 --> 13:50.019
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.598
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

13:53.866 --> 13:59.236
I know, You probably think this is all about what I said the other night
about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't.

13:59.438 --> 14:02.236
It's about me.
And I just

14:08.781 --> 14:11.807
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway..

14:16.689 --> 14:21.649
I know that some girl is going to be
incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.592
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

14:25.798 --> 14:30.235
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just have to give me a chance to...

14:32.705 --> 14:34.263
I'm divorced.

14:34.473 --> 14:40.605
- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
- Shut up!
- Ross, you must stop!

14:45.251 --> 14:47.617
That only took me an hour.

14:48.621 --> 14:54.856
You gotta understand between us we haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than a Mento.

14:56.595 --> 14:59.962
You however have had the love of a woman
for four years.

15:00.165 --> 15:05.467
Four years of closeness and sharing,
at the end of which she ripped your heart out.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.663
That is why we don't do it!

15:09.575 --> 15:13.011
I don't think that was my point!

15:13.212 --> 15:17.342
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's
only one woman for everybody? You know?

15:17.549 --> 15:20.677
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

15:20.886 --> 15:25.823
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

15:27.793 --> 15:31.092
What are you talking about?
One woman.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.291
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

15:35.467 --> 15:39.631
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

15:39.805 --> 15:43.901
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

15:44.743 --> 15:49.043
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

15:49.515 --> 15:52.075
This is the best thing that ever
happenned to you!

15:52.284 --> 15:56.118
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

15:57.022 --> 16:00.924
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

16:01.260 --> 16:05.492
- I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.796
Ever since she walked out on me..

16:13.305 --> 16:15.239
What?

16:15.441 --> 16:17.875
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

16:18.077 --> 16:22.810
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

16:23.015 --> 16:27.509
So there's going to be
a fifth date?

16:27.686 --> 16:29.313
Isn't there?

16:29.521 --> 16:31.751
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

16:33.425 --> 16:36.724
What were you going to say?

16:40.232 --> 16:43.395
Ever since she left me..

16:43.569 --> 16:46.367
I haven't been able to perform..

16:47.072 --> 16:48.903
sexually.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.111
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

16:54.279 --> 16:58.716
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.719
How long?

17:01.920 --> 17:05.014
- Two years.
- Wow.

17:05.224 --> 17:09.092
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

17:09.995 --> 17:14.989
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

17:16.502 --> 17:20.734
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

17:21.273 --> 17:26.108
We are gathered here to join together
Joanie Louise Cunningham..

17:26.311 --> 17:31.647
and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi..

17:32.384 --> 17:36.480
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.780
See!

17:37.990 --> 17:43.986
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.694
"Grab a spoon."

17:46.899 --> 17:50.232
Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

17:50.569 --> 17:54.938
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

17:58.544 --> 18:01.638
Great story.
But I gotta go.

18:01.847 --> 18:06.682
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela. Andrea. Oh, man.

18:06.885 --> 18:10.286
Andrea is the screamer.
Angela has cats.

18:10.456 --> 18:15.120
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

18:16.695 --> 18:20.995
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough..

18:21.233 --> 18:23.827
to ask a woman out..

18:24.036 --> 18:25.697
who am I going to ask?

18:49.995 --> 18:53.624
Isn't this amazing? I mean,
I've never made coffee before in my entire life.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.331
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

18:56.702 --> 19:00.433
You know, I figure If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

19:01.039 --> 19:06.170
No, I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there's nothing I can't do."

19:06.345 --> 19:11.009
Listen, while you on the roll,
If you feel like you gonna make like
a Western omelet or something..

19:13.952 --> 19:17.410
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

19:18.624 --> 19:22.060
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.620
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.498
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.667
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

19:38.710 --> 19:41.679
- Thank you so much.
- Stop.

19:41.847 --> 19:46.375
No, I'm telling you, last night was like
all my birthdays, both graduations..

19:46.585 --> 19:49.110
plus the barn-raising scene
in Witness.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.426
We'll talk later.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.428
Thank you.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.808
That wasn't a real date.

20:14.012 --> 20:17.243
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

20:18.283 --> 20:21.275
Shut up and put my table back.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.854
All right, kids, I've got to get to work.

20:24.022 --> 20:29.551
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.192
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

20:36.435 --> 20:40.997
Yeah, we all have jobs.
See, that's how we buy stuff.

20:43.141 --> 20:47.271
- Yeah, I'm an actor.
- Have I seen you in anything?

20:47.446 --> 20:49.812
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

20:50.015 --> 20:53.473
Unless you happen to catch the Wee One's
production of Pinocchio..

20:53.685 --> 20:56.483
at the little theater
in the park?

20:56.888 --> 20:58.219
It was a job, all right!

20:58.590 --> 21:01.218
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."

21:03.996 --> 21:07.762
- I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.695
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

21:13.138 --> 21:17.336
You should both know
that he's a dead man.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.477
Oh, Chandler!

21:21.913 --> 21:24.211
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?

21:24.416 --> 21:28.318
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

21:28.520 --> 21:33.048
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.857
I know.
He's just so..

21:41.366 --> 21:44.096
- You remember you and Tony Demarco?
- Oh, yeah.

21:44.303 --> 21:48.034
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.876
- Wow, are you in trouble!
- Big time!

21:52.377 --> 21:55.642
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

21:55.847 --> 21:59.408
I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

21:59.618 --> 22:04.248
I'm just going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

22:05.190 --> 22:08.091
Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.

22:08.293 --> 22:09.954
- Wish me luck!
- What for?

22:10.128 --> 22:14.531
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.144
- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.

22:27.379 --> 22:30.542
- How was Florida?
- You had sex, didn't you?

22:32.584 --> 22:34.814
- How do you do that?
- I hate you.

22:34.986 --> 22:39.013
I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot Jungle and you're having sex.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.354
So, who?

22:42.728 --> 22:44.218
You know Paul?

22:44.496 --> 22:47.863
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.927
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

22:53.105 --> 22:55.198
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

22:55.407 --> 22:59.707
You know, before me there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.541
Of course it was a line.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.614
Why would anybody
do something like that?

23:08.787 --> 23:12.052
I assume we looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

23:12.224 --> 23:15.159
"To get you into bed."

23:15.360 --> 23:17.692
I hate men.

23:17.863 --> 23:21.993
Don't hate. You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.631
Is it me?

23:23.902 --> 23:27.531
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs..

23:27.706 --> 23:30.402
and men with severe emotional problems
can hear?

23:30.575 --> 23:33.874
Come here.
Give me your feet.

23:40.118 --> 23:43.110
I just thought he was nice, you know?

23:46.358 --> 23:50.419
I can't believe
you didn't know it was a line.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.697
- Guess what?
- You got a job?

23:55.867 --> 24:00.167
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.398
- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
- And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.841
Well, you would be too,
if you found "John and David" boots on sale..

24:08.046 --> 24:10.037
50% off.

24:10.215 --> 24:13.275
How well you know me.

24:14.419 --> 24:16.944
They're my new "I don't need a job,
I don't need my parents..

24:17.155 --> 24:19.214
I've got great boots" boots.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.820
- How did you pay for them?
- Credit card.

24:23.361 --> 24:26.023
And who pays for that?

24:26.298 --> 24:29.028
My father.

24:31.803 --> 24:35.330
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time I want.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.770
You can't live off your parents your whole life.

24:37.976 --> 24:41.707
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.508
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own for your first time.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.739
Thank you.

24:46.918 --> 24:50.445
You welcome. I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 14.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.522
My mom had just killed herself,
and my stepdad was back in prison.

24:53.725 --> 24:55.750
And I got here and I didn't know anybody.

24:55.961 --> 25:00.557
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields outside port authority.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.562
And then he killed himself.

25:02.767 --> 25:07.431
And then I found aromatherapy.
So believe me I know exactly how you feel.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.336
The word you're looking for is:

25:14.012 --> 25:16.446
"Anyway.."

25:20.452 --> 25:24.218
- You ready?
- No, no, no, I'm not ready, how can I be ready?

25:24.389 --> 25:27.290
"Hey, Rach, you ready to jump out of
the airplane without a parachute?"

25:27.459 --> 25:29.689
- I can't do this.
- You can. I know you can.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.989
- I don't think so.
- Come on, you made coffee, you can do anything.

25:35.567 --> 25:38.502
Cut. Cut. Cut.

25:43.608 --> 25:47.169
You know what?
I think we can just leave it at that.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.440
- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.

25:58.123 --> 26:02.992
If you listen closely, you can hear
a thousand retailers scream.

26:06.197 --> 26:07.858
Welcome to the real world!

26:08.066 --> 26:11.297
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

26:19.210 --> 26:22.270
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?

26:22.447 --> 26:26.611
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

26:28.420 --> 26:31.753
Look what I just
found on the floor.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.181
What?

26:34.392 --> 26:38.123
That's Paul's watch.
You just put it back where you found it.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.959
Oh, boy!
All right.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.733
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

26:55.780 --> 27:00.683
- I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
- Split it?

27:04.923 --> 27:08.381
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school..

27:08.760 --> 27:11.251
I had a major crush on you.

27:12.564 --> 27:13.929
I knew.

27:14.099 --> 27:17.159
You did?

27:17.435 --> 27:20.962
I always figured you just thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.231
I did.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.471
Listen, do you think..?

27:29.681 --> 27:34.675
And try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.450
But do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime may be?

27:40.358 --> 27:42.519
Yeah.

27:42.727 --> 27:44.058
Maybe.

27:44.963 --> 27:48.262
Okay.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.604
Okay, maybe I will.

27:57.942 --> 28:01.343
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.656
See you.

28:17.962 --> 28:20.453
Wait, wait.
What's with you?

28:23.068 --> 28:27.368
I just grabbed a spoon.

28:33.478 --> 28:37.642
- I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing here

28:37.816 --> 28:40.046
- What? I said you had a...
-  What? I said you had

28:41.052 --> 28:43.577
- Would you stop?
- Was I doing it again?

28:43.755 --> 28:46.053
Yes!

28:46.357 --> 28:50.794
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

28:50.962 --> 28:55.194
- You wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit you.
- There's an image.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.934
Would anybody like more coffee?

29:01.906 --> 29:04.136
Did you make it or you're just serving it?

29:04.342 --> 29:07.937
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

29:08.146 --> 29:09.613
Kids, new dream.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.043
I'm in Las Vegas.

29:11.216 --> 29:13.844
Miss, more coffee?

29:14.252 --> 29:17.983
Excuse me, could you give this
to that guy over there?

29:18.556 --> 29:21.320
Go ahead.
Thank you.

29:21.526 --> 29:24.256
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.555
I'm in Las Vegas.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.831
I'm Liza Minnelli..
