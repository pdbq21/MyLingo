WEBVTT

00:05.972 --> 00:08.998
All right! You guys,
it's starting to snow.

00:09.809 --> 00:14.007
And look, Ugly Naked Guy
is hanging candy canes.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.442
Where?

00:16.483 --> 00:19.145
Oh. Well.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.411
That's festive.

00:23.556 --> 00:27.014
Guys, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.325
Wait, wait. What is that?

00:31.531 --> 00:34.523
-That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?
-No, I don't.

00:34.734 --> 00:39.262
-He's cute! Where'd you get him?
-My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.

00:39.472 --> 00:40.837
That is so cruel.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.272
Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

00:47.447 --> 00:50.245
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.622
Is he gonna live with you
in your apartment?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.917
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.091
Why not get a roommate?

01:03.296 --> 01:08.427
You reach a certain age, having
a roommate is just kind of pathet

01:11.104 --> 01:15.404
That's " pathet. " Sanskrit for
" really cool way to live. "

01:16.910 --> 01:19.003
The One With the Monkey

02:04.958 --> 02:07.256
I' m doing new material tonight.

02:07.460 --> 02:12.090
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.930
You might wanna open with the snowman.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.402
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey, buddy.

02:20.607 --> 02:24.703
-So how'd it go?
-I didn't get the job.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.647
How could you not?
You were Santa last year.

02:29.716 --> 02:33.777
Some fat guy's sleeping
with the store manager.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.921
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.423
-What are you gonna be?
-One of his helpers.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.620
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.130
Do you know what you' re doing
for New Year's?

02:49.435 --> 02:52.165
Hey, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

02:52.372 --> 02:56.638
You have Paolo. You don't have
to face the pressure...

02:56.876 --> 03:00.869
...of finding lips to kiss
when the ball drops!

03:01.080 --> 03:02.809
Man, I'm talking loud!

03:04.384 --> 03:07.876
Paolo's gonna be in Rome
this New Year's.

03:08.087 --> 03:12.114
-I'll be just as pathetic as you.
-Yeah, you wish.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.054
I've got an idea. Dinner.

03:16.262 --> 03:20.130
It's perfect. We'll put it between
lunch and breakfast.

03:21.801 --> 03:25.567
I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick Clark holiday.

03:25.772 --> 03:30.004
I say this year, we make a pact.
Just the six of us. Dinner.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.541
-Sure.
-Fine.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.177
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.484
-Phoebe, you' re on.
-Oh, good.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.450
Hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand...

03:43.656 --> 03:45.851
... Miss Phoebe Buffay.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.593
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

03:52.498 --> 03:56.298
I wanna start with a song
that means a lot to me.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.801
I made a man with eyes of coal

04:05.078 --> 04:08.275
And a smile so bewitching

04:08.948 --> 04:11.473
How was I supposed to know

04:11.751 --> 04:14.618
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

04:21.761 --> 04:24.093
My mother's ashes

04:24.597 --> 04:27.532
Even her eyelashes

04:27.867 --> 04:33.863
Are resting in a little yellow jar

04:36.409 --> 04:39.242
And sometimes when it's freezing

04:39.879 --> 04:42.211
I feel a little sneezy

04:42.915 --> 04:47.545
And now I Excuse me?
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

04:49.222 --> 04:52.988
Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.618
No. No, that's okay.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.764
If it's important enough
while I'm playing...

04:59.966 --> 05:03.163
...it's important enough
for everyone else.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.031
That guy's going home with a note.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.807
-I was just saying
-Speak up.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.139
Sorry, l

05:16.182 --> 05:20.585
I was saying you were the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.982
And he said that Daryl Hannah...

05:23.189 --> 05:26.522
...was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.923
I said I liked her in Splash,
but not Wall Street.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.121
I thought she had a hard quality.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.466
While Daryl is beautiful
in a conventional way...

05:37.670 --> 05:41.231
...you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.870
Then that's when you started yelling.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.951
We're gonna take a short break.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.288
That guy's going home
with more than a note.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.865
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.976
I can't believe he hasn't
kissed you yet.

06:18.177 --> 06:22.807
By my sixth date with Paolo,
he'd already named both my breasts.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.651
Did I just share too much?

06:29.989 --> 06:31.786
Just a smidge.

06:32.492 --> 06:36.087
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.354
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too!

06:38.564 --> 06:42.125
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

06:42.335 --> 06:45.964
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

06:50.843 --> 06:55.041
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.481
I just wanna be with him all the time.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.118
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.983
And special occasions.

07:07.226 --> 07:10.218
I see. You're gonna ask him
to New Year's.

07:10.496 --> 07:14.557
-She's gonna break the pact.
-No! No, no.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.894
No. Yeah, could I just?

07:19.672 --> 07:22.505
-Yeah. I already asked Janice.
-What?

07:22.708 --> 07:25.438
This was a pact! This was your pact!

07:25.645 --> 07:28.273
I couldn't handle the pressure.
I snapped!

07:28.481 --> 07:31.507
But that was the worst breakup
in history!

07:31.717 --> 07:35.153
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

07:36.489 --> 07:39.219
Hi, sorry I'm late.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.732
Too many jokes.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.535
Must mock Joey.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.065
Nice shoes, huh?

07:57.910 --> 07:59.741
God, you're killing me!

08:01.781 --> 08:05.046
Ross, he's playing
with my spatulas again!

08:05.251 --> 08:09.984
-He's not gonna hurt them, right?
-Do you always have to bring him?

08:11.290 --> 08:16.193
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
We had our first fight this morning.

08:17.797 --> 08:23.064
It has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.305
He threw some feces.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.536
If you're working late,
I can look in on him.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.407
That would be great!

08:35.781 --> 08:39.547
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.811
You're not doing it for me.

08:42.021 --> 08:45.047
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.157
But you can't actually
test this theory.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.463
T oday's particle accelerators
aren't powerful enough...

08:58.771 --> 09:03.003
-...to simulate these conditions.
-I have a question then.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.871
-Yeah?
-Do you plan on kissing me ever?

09:09.916 --> 09:14.444
That's definitely a valid question,
and the answer...

09:14.754 --> 09:18.349
...would be yes. Yes, I was.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.092
But I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss...

09:26.299 --> 09:29.530
...at a phenomenal moment
because it's you.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.827
Sure.

09:31.037 --> 09:35.030
The longer I waited, the more
phenomenal the kiss had to be.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.268
Now, it's just gotta be
one of those things where l...

09:39.579 --> 09:42.605
...sweep everything off the table.

09:42.815 --> 09:45.613
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.945
David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of fella.

09:50.156 --> 09:54.422
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.928
-Really?
-I'm sure.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.064
You should just do it. Just throw me.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.767
-Now?
-Yeah, right now. Just....

10:05.972 --> 10:07.872
Okay. Okay. Okay.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.337
You know what?
This is really expensive.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.648
And this was a gift.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.752
-Now you' re just tidying up.
-Okay.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.116
-You want me to throw you?
-I can hop.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.571
T ell me something, what does
" no-date pact" mean to you?

10:48.781 --> 10:52.615
It's just that Chandler
and Phoebe have somebody.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.820
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.114
-Your ex-boyfriend?
-Yeah.

10:57.456 --> 11:02.018
-You know more than one Fun Bobby?
-I happen to know a Fun Bob.

11:03.963 --> 11:08.457
-Okay. Here we go.
-There's no room for milk.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.966
There. Now there is.

11:16.208 --> 11:20.611
So on our no-date evening,
three of you now have dates.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.446
-Four.
-Five.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.945
Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.520
And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.815
What's an elf to do?

11:33.592 --> 11:37.926
So I'll be the only one alone
when the ball drops?

11:38.197 --> 11:42.395
We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

11:42.601 --> 11:46.537
I'll know. This is so not
what I needed right now.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.139
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's Marcel.

11:51.777 --> 11:56.680
He's angry with me. I have
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.545
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.280
That's weird.
I had a blast with him.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.481
-Really?
-We played, watched TV.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.217
That juggling thing is amazing.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.189
What juggling thing?

12:14.900 --> 12:17.892
With the socks?
I figured you taught him that.

12:18.704 --> 12:19.864
No.

12:21.073 --> 12:25.169
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just socks. And a melon.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.909
-Phoebe!
-Max. Do you know everybody?

12:32.118 --> 12:34.678
No. Have you seen David?

12:35.287 --> 12:36.811
He hasn't been around.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.981
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.753
-Minsk?
-Minsk. It's in Russia.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.822
I know where Minsk is.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.169
We got the grant.
Three years, all expenses paid.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.807
And if you're gonna do Minsk,
that's the way to go.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.200
-So when do you leave?
-January 1 st.

13:07.119 --> 13:12.022
-Hello?
-What? Hey. Hi.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.819
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.826
Congratulations! This is so exciting!

13:20.199 --> 13:23.168
It'd be even more exciting
if we were going.

13:23.369 --> 13:26.065
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.264
T ell her. " I don't wanna go...

13:29.475 --> 13:32.740
...to work with Lipson,
Yamaguchi and Flank.

13:32.945 --> 13:36.210
I wanna stay and make out
with my girlfriend! "

13:36.415 --> 13:39.009
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.387
So you're really not going?

13:42.588 --> 13:45.716
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I just....

13:45.925 --> 13:48.621
How can I leave you?
I just found you.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.389
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

13:54.733 --> 13:57.065
I don't know. You decide.

13:57.269 --> 14:00.102
-Don't do that.
-But l' m asking you.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.935
-I can't make a decision. Just
-Okay. Stay.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.712
-Stay.
-Stay.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.088
Getting so good at that!

14:19.391 --> 14:21.484
It was Max's stuff.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.165
I love this artichoke thing.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.829
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.677
You remember Janice.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.444
Vividly.

14:45.951 --> 14:49.682
-How are you?
-I am fantastic.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.947
Now.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.289
It's amazing. We've been back
together for what...

14:56.495 --> 14:59.328
-...Iike 1 0 minutes, and
-ls that all?

15:00.633 --> 15:02.658
It's like we were never apart.

15:03.002 --> 15:06.438
Of course, we were, but
Forgive and forget.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.164
Well, forget.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.285
-Hi.
-Hi, l' m Sandy.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.717
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

15:33.832 --> 15:37.996
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah. That's okay, right?

15:40.139 --> 15:44.439
-Party!
-That thing is not coming in here!

15:44.643 --> 15:47.168
This is how you greet guests?

15:47.379 --> 15:52.043
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?

15:52.584 --> 15:56.645
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate
on my coffee table.

15:56.855 --> 16:00.188
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

16:02.061 --> 16:06.361
And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here...

16:06.565 --> 16:08.192
...Iike nothing happened

16:09.134 --> 16:12.365
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.868
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.775
What do you say you and I mingle?

16:18.944 --> 16:23.278
All right, I'll catch up
with you later.

16:28.654 --> 16:33.455
Oh, my gosh!
Rachel, honey, are you okay?

16:33.726 --> 16:38.663
-Where's Paolo?
-Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.395
And then your face exploded?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.063
No.

16:44.703 --> 16:48.503
Okay. I was at the airport
getting into a cab...

16:48.741 --> 16:53.678
...when this woman, this blond
planet with a pocketbook...

16:53.879 --> 16:58.145
...starts yelling. Something
about how it was her cab first.

16:58.350 --> 17:02.446
The next thing, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!

17:02.654 --> 17:05.555
And I was blowing my attack
whistle thingy...

17:05.758 --> 17:08.318
...and three more cabs show up.

17:08.527 --> 17:13.157
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!

17:13.599 --> 17:18.764
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.873
Everybody having fun at the party?

17:26.945 --> 17:29.539
-Are people eating my dip?
-Yes.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.253
There.

17:36.955 --> 17:41.051
-That looks okay, right?
-You went a bit wide on the lipstick.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.728
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.

17:43.929 --> 17:47.626
It's hard for me to tell.
My eye's closing up.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.801
Let me get it for you.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.300
-Ow!
-Okay.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.734
You know what? It looks fine.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.706
Okay, here we go.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.104
Screw Paolo,
screw the psycho cab lady.

18:02.314 --> 18:05.249
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have a good time.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.112
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

18:07.319 --> 18:10.288
All right, there you go. This way.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.117
Here you go.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.987
When I saw you at the store
last week...

18:19.665 --> 18:24.068
...it was the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

18:26.338 --> 18:30.365
-Wow, that's dirty.
-Yeah.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.502
Hey, kids.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.774
He doesn't have to spend
the whole evening with me...

18:41.019 --> 18:42.782
... but at least check in.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.123
There you are!

18:47.693 --> 18:50.287
You got away from me.

18:50.596 --> 18:54.657
-But you found me.
-Here, Ross, take our picture.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.268
Smile. You' re on Janice Camera.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.800
Kill me. Kill me now.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.541
Hi, l' m Rachel.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.181
So whose friend are you?

19:14.653 --> 19:18.214
Look at me, spilling everywhere.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.789
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

19:25.130 --> 19:28.566
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my grandfather...

19:28.767 --> 19:30.598
...died about two hours ago.

19:30.802 --> 19:36.468
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so here I am.

19:36.942 --> 19:42.437
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man?
Whoa! Who died?

19:46.685 --> 19:49.620
It's gonna be an open casket,
you know?

19:50.756 --> 19:53.623
So at least I'll get to see him again.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.960
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.400
Let me talk to you for just a sec.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.361
I recently lost
a grandparent myself...

20:07.573 --> 20:10.599
...so I really know exactly
how you feel.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.778
But you' re really bringing
the party down.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.311
-l' m sorry.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.675
There you go. There you go.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.823
I' m gonna blow this one up
and write " Reunited " in glitter.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.959
All right, Janice, that's it!

20:29.161 --> 20:31.755
Janice. Janice.

20:31.964 --> 20:36.697
Hey, Janice, when I invited you,
I didn't think it meant

20:36.969 --> 20:39.199
Oh, no!

20:43.275 --> 20:45.675
I' m sorry you misunderstood.

20:46.044 --> 20:48.274
You listen to me!
You listen to me!

20:48.513 --> 20:53.280
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me!

20:55.220 --> 20:57.154
Will you give me the thing?

21:00.859 --> 21:03.259
-Hi, Max.
-Yoko.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.632
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.469
-Wow.
-lt won't be the same...

21:16.308 --> 21:19.971
... but it will still be Minsk.
Happy New Year.

21:21.580 --> 21:25.311
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, l' m fine. I' m fine.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.247
Come on.

21:34.259 --> 21:38.525
-You' re going to Minsk.
-No, l' m not going to Minsk.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.391
You are so going to Minsk.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.568
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.466
If I go, I have to break up with you.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.665
-And I can't break up with you.
-Yes, you can.

21:50.876 --> 21:55.245
Just say, " Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.175
That's what I have to do. "

21:57.416 --> 22:01.113
And I say, "Your work?
How can you say that? "

22:02.421 --> 22:07.620
Then you say, " I have no choice.
Can't you understand that? "

22:07.826 --> 22:11.887
And I say, " No! No!
I can't understand that! "

22:12.097 --> 22:13.655
-Ow.
-Sorry.

22:15.367 --> 22:18.097
And then you put
your arms around me.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.904
-Then you put your arms around me.
-Oh, sorry.

22:22.674 --> 22:27.236
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.710
I'll never forget you.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.811
Then you say that you have to go...

22:34.019 --> 22:38.820
... because you don't wanna start the
year with me if you can't finish it.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.792
I' m gonna miss you,
you scientist guy.

22:51.236 --> 22:53.227
Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.

22:53.438 --> 22:58.273
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.238
It gets better every....

23:00.512 --> 23:02.605
Here you go, kids.

23:02.814 --> 23:05.647
And then the peacock bit me.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.316
Please kiss me at midnight!

23:13.492 --> 23:16.950
-You seen Sandy?
-I don't know how to tell you this...

23:17.195 --> 23:21.427
... but she's in the bedroom
getting it on with Max.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.999
Oh, I did know how to tell you.

23:25.103 --> 23:28.766
-Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping.
-What?

23:29.708 --> 23:32.700
The ball is dropping!

23:34.112 --> 23:36.706
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.611
And the moment of joy is upon us.

23:40.218 --> 23:43.119
Looks like that no-date pact
worked out.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.056
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!

23:46.258 --> 23:48.556
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

23:48.794 --> 23:51.456
four, three, two...

23:51.663 --> 23:54.496
...one! Happy New Year!

23:56.501 --> 23:59.834
I thought I'd throw this out.
I' m no math whiz...

24:00.038 --> 24:05.101
... but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.075
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

24:09.347 --> 24:13.147
-I can't kiss anyone.
-So, I'm kissing everyone?

24:13.885 --> 24:17.116
No, you can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

24:17.322 --> 24:19.916
So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.319
Somebody kiss me.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.360
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me!

24:25.597 --> 24:27.497
All right! All right!

24:28.099 --> 24:29.498
There!

24:35.941 --> 24:38.501
I wanted this to work so much.

24:39.177 --> 24:40.906
I'm still in there.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.172
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

24:44.783 --> 24:47.183
But he's just phoning it in.

24:48.954 --> 24:54.153
It's hard that something you love
so much doesn't love you back.

24:54.359 --> 24:57.453
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
