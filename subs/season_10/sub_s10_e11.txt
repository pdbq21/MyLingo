WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:03.828
- Hey, guys...
- Wait! Let me tell them.

00:04.031 --> 00:05.385
- Sure.
- Joey's gonna be...

00:05.553 --> 00:07.705
...a celebrity guest on a game show.

00:07.915 --> 00:09.235
Really? Which one?

00:10.878 --> 00:13.235
Fish. Seaweed.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.472
- A sunken ship.
- Things you find in the ocean.

00:15.643 --> 00:18.718
- You're gonna be on Pyramid!
- Yeah.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.881
- That was our favorite game show ever.
- Except for Match Game.

00:22.049 --> 00:25.283
- Or Win, Lose or Draw.
- What did I marry into?

00:25.813 --> 00:28.090
You guys wanna come
and watch me tape the show?

00:28.255 --> 00:31.011
Oh, we can't. We're throwing Phoebe
a bachelorette party.

00:31.178 --> 00:34.538
Yeah. Sorry, boys, this ride's closing.

00:35.663 --> 00:38.976
And Chandler and I have this stupid
college alumni thing.

00:39.146 --> 00:41.868
I can't believe you get
to meet Donny Osmond.

00:42.830 --> 00:45.062
Seriously?

00:46.674 --> 00:50.192
Ross and I always wanted to be
Donny and Marie.

00:50.357 --> 00:52.590
You guys just keep getting
cooler and cooler.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.684
Yeah, we used to perform
for our family and friends.

00:56.844 --> 01:00.557
Oh, God, that's right.
I blocked that out.

01:07.494 --> 01:09.327
I'm leaving you.

02:00.548 --> 02:03.941
It's so weird to see
all these people again.

02:04.111 --> 02:06.263
Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.

02:06.433 --> 02:09.952
- Who?
- He was roommates with John Rosoff.

02:10.117 --> 02:13.237
He went out with Andrea Tamborino.

02:13.761 --> 02:17.040
She dumped him for Michael SkIoff.

02:18.325 --> 02:20.888
Did I go to this school?

02:21.969 --> 02:25.282
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.
You gotta remember her.

02:25.452 --> 02:27.285
Sure. Nice.

02:27.454 --> 02:29.333
Dude, you're married to my sister.

02:29.537 --> 02:32.337
You're right. By saying "nice,"
I'm virtually licking her.

02:33.941 --> 02:37.493
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think I should ask her out?

02:37.665 --> 02:39.737
Are you asking permission
to break the pact?

02:39.907 --> 02:41.786
Yes, please.

02:53.681 --> 02:56.642
Hey. Hey, check out
the fliers for the band.

02:56.804 --> 02:59.844
- I made them on a Macintosh.
- Awesome.

03:00.007 --> 03:01.522
The name really stands out.

03:01.689 --> 03:06.209
Thanks to a little something called
Helvetica Bold 24-point.

03:06.614 --> 03:08.971
Man, we're gonna rock
that Asian Student Union.

03:11.819 --> 03:15.019
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Missy.

03:15.182 --> 03:18.861
- Our band is playing on Friday.
- Yeah, you should come check us out.

03:19.026 --> 03:21.337
We're called Way/No Way.

03:22.149 --> 03:24.666
- No way.
- Way.

03:24.832 --> 03:27.189
- Great. I'll be there.
- Fresh.

03:27.354 --> 03:28.584
- Boss.
- Mint.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.714
- She's gone.
- I know it.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.357
- I am totally gonna ask her out.
- Dude, I was gonna ask her out.

03:36.524 --> 03:40.726
- I said it first, bro.
- Well, I thought it first, Homes.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.971
- Look, if you date...
- Wait! Wait! What are we doing?

03:45.653 --> 03:49.285
What we have is too important
to mess it up over some girl.

03:49.456 --> 03:51.893
I mean, we can get laid
any time we want.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.453
Totally.

03:53.621 --> 03:57.504
- I had sex in high school.
- Me too. I'm good at it.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.460
All right, I say we make a pact.

04:01.629 --> 04:04.270
Neither of us will go out
with Missy Goldberg.

04:04.471 --> 04:06.510
You got it.

04:07.474 --> 04:10.116
That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
and Molly Ringwald...

04:10.277 --> 04:12.589
...who we can't go out with.
- Those are the pacts.

04:12.760 --> 04:16.119
And Sheena Easton. But we probably
couldn't get her anyway.

04:16.283 --> 04:18.435
Maybe not you.

04:19.847 --> 04:22.648
Well, I officially give you permission
to break the pact.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.130
Thank you.

04:27.575 --> 04:32.255
Here I go. Hey, remember how scary
it used to be going up to girls in college?

04:32.419 --> 04:35.893
- Your hands are shaking.
- I know. And I can't stop sweating.

04:37.064 --> 04:40.856
Five, four, three. Applause.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.551
Yeah!

04:46.714 --> 04:49.595
Welcome. It is Soap Opera Week
here on Pyramid.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.275
Let's meet our contestants. First,
Gene Lester is a database specialist.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.357
He's gonna be playing with
Days of Our Lives star Joey Tribbiani.

04:59.486 --> 05:01.923
And over here,
we have Henrietta Cherry.

05:02.089 --> 05:05.688
I know it can be intimidating for
regular people to be around celebrities...

05:05.853 --> 05:09.930
...but relax. I'm just like you,
only better-Iooking and richer.

05:10.497 --> 05:14.255
She'll be playing with star of
General Hospital, Leslie Charleson.

05:16.143 --> 05:19.104
Welcome, everybody. Good luck
to all of you. Let's play Pyramid.

05:19.266 --> 05:22.740
All right? Now, we flipped a coin
before the show.

05:22.910 --> 05:25.632
Gene, you won the toss,
so you'll start. Which category?

05:25.793 --> 05:28.515
- "You Crossed the Line."
- "You Crossed the Line." Joey...

05:28.676 --> 05:31.716
...describe for Gene these things
that have lines.

05:31.879 --> 05:34.680
Give me 20 seconds on the clock,
please. Ready? Go.

05:36.283 --> 05:39.005
Okay, it's a store like a supermarket.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.283
I see what I did there. Okay, okay.
I'm writing in my...

05:43.450 --> 05:45.967
- Diary.
- No, more like a notebook.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.286
If I'm building a house, the plan...

05:51.458 --> 05:54.339
...isn't called a "shmooprint"...

05:54.582 --> 05:55.857
I can't do that either?

05:57.625 --> 06:01.303
In high school, I once had sex
with a girl right in the middle of the...?

06:01.468 --> 06:04.748
- Cafeteria?
- Yeah, but they're not looking for that.

06:08.916 --> 06:12.275
- Thank you so much for this.
- You like it?

06:12.439 --> 06:15.515
Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.

06:15.683 --> 06:17.801
When's the dirty stuff starting?

06:18.966 --> 06:21.881
- What?
- The strippers and the guys dancing...

06:22.049 --> 06:24.520
...and, you know, pee-pees flying about.

06:27.775 --> 06:31.248
Pheebs, I... There isn't gonna be
any "flying about."

06:31.418 --> 06:34.458
We thought we were
a little too mature for stuff like that.

06:34.902 --> 06:36.701
Oh, okay.

06:37.745 --> 06:41.537
I see what you're doing. That's fine.
This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.

06:44.351 --> 06:46.309
Raunchy.

06:48.516 --> 06:51.556
Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be
that kind of a party.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.917
Really? So this is...?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.553
This is my big sendoff into married life?

06:57.725 --> 07:00.686
Rachel, this is the only
bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.

07:00.848 --> 07:02.886
I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.

07:06.213 --> 07:09.208
Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?

07:11.138 --> 07:12.971
No.

07:13.420 --> 07:16.381
- Phoebe, of course there's more.
- Okay.

07:16.544 --> 07:19.505
I mean, let me just go talk to Monica...

07:19.667 --> 07:22.263
...and get an ETA on the pee-pees.

07:25.192 --> 07:28.825
Now, Gene, I must remind you, you need
all six of these to stay in the game.

07:28.996 --> 07:32.959
Describe for Joey
"things you find in your refrigerator."

07:33.601 --> 07:36.562
They might as well
just give us the points.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.445
Give me 20 seconds on the clock.
Ready? Go.

07:41.048 --> 07:43.884
- You put this in your coffee.
- A spoon. Your hands. Your face.

07:44.051 --> 07:47.604
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

07:47.815 --> 07:51.653
- It's heavier than milk.
- A rock. A dog. The Earth.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.809
Pass.

07:54.181 --> 07:56.573
- You put it on a sandwich.
- Salami. Anchovies. Jam.

07:56.744 --> 08:00.103
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

08:00.307 --> 08:02.904
- It's made from eggs.
- Chickens?

08:03.070 --> 08:04.345
Pass.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.353
- You put this on a hamburger.
- ketchup! Relish!

08:07.515 --> 08:08.835
Stop!

08:09.116 --> 08:12.749
Oh, time's up. Well, Joey, you were...

08:12.920 --> 08:16.279
...almost on a roll there. Gene...

08:16.443 --> 08:19.358
...you'll have a chance to go to
the Winner's Circle, but now...

08:19.527 --> 08:24.161
...Henrietta, you're going to the Winner's
Circle to try your luck for $ 10,000...

08:24.331 --> 08:26.483
...right after this. Don't go away.

08:26.814 --> 08:28.886
And we're out.

08:29.056 --> 08:33.053
Oh, so we didn't win.
But it's fun to play the game, right?

08:33.501 --> 08:36.860
I got a kid starting college.
I have to get surgery on my knee.

08:37.024 --> 08:38.664
You just lost me 10 grand.

08:39.306 --> 08:41.378
Oh, wow.

08:42.069 --> 08:45.382
I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise,
we'll do better next time.

08:45.553 --> 08:48.194
Well, I will, because I won't be
playing with you.

08:49.677 --> 08:51.396
Hey, some of those are pretty hard.

08:51.679 --> 08:54.719
Like, why would there be
a ghost in my fridge?

08:56.443 --> 08:58.083
Yeah.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.677
- So Saturday night?
- I'd love to.

09:01.849 --> 09:03.363
Great.

09:05.933 --> 09:08.324
So how come it took you so long
to ask me out?

09:08.495 --> 09:10.728
Oh, well, this is gonna sound
kind of silly...

09:10.898 --> 09:13.779
...but do you remember
my roommate, Chandler Bing?

09:13.941 --> 09:16.218
Sure. He was in your "band."

09:18.465 --> 09:22.588
It's been 16 years,
but the air quotes still hurt.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.469
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Anyway...

09:24.632 --> 09:27.832
Well, he and I both
really liked you a lot...

09:27.995 --> 09:31.674
...but we didn't want it to jeopardize
our friendship, so we made a pact...

09:31.839 --> 09:34.196
...that neither of us could ask you out.

09:34.562 --> 09:36.953
- Really?
- Yeah, why?

09:37.124 --> 09:40.518
Well, Chandler and I used to make out.

09:40.688 --> 09:42.567
A lot.

09:44.532 --> 09:46.489
- You did?
- Yeah.

09:46.654 --> 09:50.697
- We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
- And on my turf?!

09:53.661 --> 09:57.213
Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.

09:57.384 --> 10:00.459
He's coming from Jersey. He said
he'd get here as fast as he could.

10:01.509 --> 10:03.547
- Who is it?
- It's the police.

10:03.711 --> 10:05.544
The police!

10:08.235 --> 10:11.914
That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.960
What's the matter, officer?
Has someone been bad?

10:25.893 --> 10:28.535
That's a lot of stairs.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.933
Boy.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.576
You should warn people
there's no elevator.

10:40.828 --> 10:44.745
I should not have had
that Mexican food for lunch.

10:46.794 --> 10:49.071
Are you gonna be okay, Officer...?

10:49.236 --> 10:52.197
- Goodbody.
- Lf you say so.

10:54.401 --> 10:56.793
So where's the young lady...

10:57.044 --> 11:01.360
...who I am supposed to take
downtown?

11:03.691 --> 11:05.729
Oh, God.

11:06.654 --> 11:09.933
All right. Somebody show me
where to plug in my box...

11:10.097 --> 11:13.172
...and we'll get this party started.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.018
- Over here?
- Yeah.

11:17.184 --> 11:19.256
- All right.
- Rachel?

11:19.947 --> 11:22.942
- Yeah?
- Are you kidding?

11:23.230 --> 11:26.066
We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
so we got the phone book...

11:26.233 --> 11:30.196
...and got the first name we could find.
- How old's your phone book?

11:31.318 --> 11:34.917
Oh, my God, this man is gonna
get naked in my apartment.

11:35.122 --> 11:37.798
God, no. I don't wanna see him
take his clothes off.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.844
Are you talking about me?

11:40.568 --> 11:42.606
No.

11:42.770 --> 11:46.892
I mean, obviously we wanna see you
take your clothes off.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.490
You big piece of eye candy.

11:51.779 --> 11:56.174
Okay. Okay, ladies,
can I have your attention, please?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.057
Oh, yeah.

12:00.467 --> 12:05.593
Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?

12:08.235 --> 12:12.073
I should warn you,
I have a concealed weapon.

12:15.923 --> 12:20.000
I hope you're familiar
with this state's penal code.

12:21.849 --> 12:24.206
Okay, okay. Enough teasing.

12:24.371 --> 12:27.446
Now for some pleasing.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.558
She cringed.

12:58.526 --> 13:01.919
This is how I look when I'm turned-on.

13:03.531 --> 13:05.603
You were talking about me before.

13:05.773 --> 13:09.212
Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here.
Where's my hat?

13:11.098 --> 13:13.979
Look, I've been in this business
for a long time.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.815
Shocking.

13:16.744 --> 13:20.741
Now, if you'll just pay me my $300,
I'll be on my way.

13:20.908 --> 13:23.744
- $300? Are you kidding?
- That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.

13:23.911 --> 13:26.188
You're not gonna pay him.
He didn't do anything.

13:26.353 --> 13:30.316
Didn't do anything? I took a bus
all the way from Hoboken.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.837
I climbed, I don't know,
like, a billion stairs.

13:34.001 --> 13:36.677
And it's not like I can
take them two at a time.

13:39.406 --> 13:42.766
I don't care.
We're not paying you $300 for this.

13:42.930 --> 13:45.572
It's not my fault if you're
too uptight to appreciate...

13:45.733 --> 13:48.488
...the male form in all its glory.

13:48.696 --> 13:52.328
Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't
wanna watch a middle-aged guy...

13:52.499 --> 13:57.180
...dance around in what I can only
assume is a child's Halloween costume.

13:59.707 --> 14:02.782
I may have borrowed this
from my nephew...

14:02.950 --> 14:07.949
...but let me assure you,
what's underneath is all man.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.996
I'm sorry, did you say "all man"
or "old man"?

14:13.681 --> 14:15.719
You're mean.

14:15.883 --> 14:17.921
- Look, officer... Sir?
- Damn it.

14:21.609 --> 14:25.127
Big surprise.
The hunk of beef has feelings.

14:27.254 --> 14:29.451
Applause.

14:29.617 --> 14:33.249
Okay, Henrietta, you picked
"Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."

14:33.420 --> 14:36.301
My friend Rachel has a kid.
I totally know nursery rhymes.

14:36.463 --> 14:40.825
Joey, describe these things associated
with the United States Congress.

14:43.911 --> 14:45.824
Give me 20 seconds
on the clock, please.

14:45.993 --> 14:48.190
Ready? Go.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.636
Pass.

14:56.083 --> 14:57.358
Pass.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.480
Pass.

15:02.089 --> 15:03.922
- The thing hanging in your throat.
- Uvula.

15:04.291 --> 15:05.567
Then pass.

15:07.294 --> 15:10.255
Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get
all the points you needed...

15:10.417 --> 15:14.938
...so that means, Gene, you are going to
the Winner's Circle to try for $ 10,000.

15:15.102 --> 15:18.781
And you're gonna be going there
with Joey Tribbiani.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.947
You made out with Missy Goldberg?

15:24.111 --> 15:26.912
How could you do that
after you promised me?

15:28.235 --> 15:29.511
Excuse me.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.635
That didn't make us sound gay at all.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.875
- You broke the pact.
- Ross, that was 16 years ago.

15:36.043 --> 15:39.436
That doesn't matter. We're talking
about the foundation of our friendship.

15:39.687 --> 15:43.399
I believe the foundation of our friendship
was unfortunate hair.

15:45.372 --> 15:48.971
If we're really gonna do this, it's not
like you never broke one of the pacts.

15:49.136 --> 15:50.571
- I didn't.
- Oh, really?

15:50.738 --> 15:52.058
- No.
- Oh, really?

15:52.219 --> 15:53.813
- No.
- Adrienne Turner.

15:53.981 --> 15:55.461
Yes?

15:56.904 --> 15:58.578
- Hey, Adrienne.
- Hey, Adrienne. Hey.

16:00.347 --> 16:02.499
I never did anything
with Adrienne Turner.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.822
Oh, please. And you knew
how much I liked her.

16:04.992 --> 16:06.825
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:06.994 --> 16:08.907
Really? Remember
that party freshman year?

16:09.076 --> 16:11.547
A week before Christmas vacation? I do.

16:11.719 --> 16:13.996
You had some visitors.

16:20.207 --> 16:22.849
I can't believe we're
at a real college party.

16:23.010 --> 16:25.207
I have to pee so bad.

16:25.372 --> 16:27.490
This is so awesome.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.852
College guys are so cute.

16:30.017 --> 16:32.487
- Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
- I know.

16:32.660 --> 16:37.534
But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim
wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.

16:38.866 --> 16:41.588
Hey, look, there's Chandler.

16:43.911 --> 16:47.031
That stupid friend of Ross'
who said I was fat.

16:47.194 --> 16:50.030
- I've already lost four pounds.
- You can so totally tell.

16:50.197 --> 16:51.996
I know!

16:53.200 --> 16:55.592
Well, let's see,
maybe he knows where Ross is.

16:58.245 --> 17:00.442
Hey, how's it going?

17:00.648 --> 17:02.002
- Aren't you...?
- Yeah, Rachel.

17:02.169 --> 17:05.927
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.086
Right. So how you doing?

17:08.255 --> 17:09.770
Bitchen.

17:10.778 --> 17:12.771
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Chandler.

17:12.940 --> 17:16.015
It's really nice to see you. Not!

17:17.865 --> 17:19.539
Okay.

17:19.707 --> 17:21.779
I'll see if I can find Ross.

17:22.510 --> 17:24.901
Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.

17:25.633 --> 17:29.630
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.

17:33.961 --> 17:37.640
Listen, Adrienne,
you can't tell Chandler about this.

17:37.805 --> 17:41.848
Oh, believe me, Ross,
I won't be telling anybody about this.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.770
Cool.

17:52.259 --> 17:54.651
I didn't know you knew about that.

17:54.822 --> 17:57.338
Well, I did. And it hurt.

17:57.505 --> 18:00.944
That's when I wrote the song
"Betrayal in the Common Room."

18:03.110 --> 18:05.832
Man, I'm sorry.

18:05.993 --> 18:09.033
Look, that was a long time ago.

18:09.196 --> 18:13.717
So I made out with Adrienne,
and you made out with Missy.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.001
Well, I guess we're even.

18:20.728 --> 18:22.481
We are even, right?

18:25.052 --> 18:28.969
One more thing. I was so pissed at you
that night, I wanted to get back at you.

18:29.136 --> 18:32.370
So I thought, "Who does Ross
like more than anybody?"

18:34.341 --> 18:37.461
What did you do to my mom?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.108
Not her.

18:57.965 --> 19:00.037
I am so drunk.

19:01.248 --> 19:05.963
That's weird. I've had the same number
of beers as you and don't feel anything.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.212
So you girls having fun?

19:08.375 --> 19:10.447
For your information, ass-munch...

19:11.258 --> 19:15.096
...I've lost four pounds.
Maybe even five with all the dancing.

19:17.024 --> 19:19.335
- Somebody order a pizza?
- Oh, that's me!

19:22.510 --> 19:26.632
I am so not gonna do good
on my SATs tomorrow.

19:27.474 --> 19:31.232
Well, maybe you could go to school here
next year and we could totally hang out.

19:31.398 --> 19:32.879
Oh, yeah. There's a plan.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.274
Why don't I just start taking
my smart pills now.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.040
Well, maybe you could get in
on a beauty scholarship.

19:40.087 --> 19:41.966
What a line.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.808
- So where are you applying to?
- Well...

19:48.976 --> 19:52.939
...I think it's kind of really important
that I go somewhere where there's sun.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.862
So I'm sort of... Hey!

19:56.103 --> 19:57.743
I'm in college, and I'm in a band.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.704
Yeah, okay.

20:07.515 --> 20:12.115
What's the matter? You never saw
a 50-year-old stripper cry before?

20:13.881 --> 20:15.601
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.

20:15.763 --> 20:18.838
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?

20:19.006 --> 20:22.764
I should have hung up
that breakaway jockstrap years ago.

20:25.052 --> 20:27.694
What am I gonna do? I mean...

20:27.855 --> 20:30.496
...this has been my life for 32 years.

20:30.658 --> 20:34.814
Taking my clothes off
in front of people is all I know.

20:35.222 --> 20:38.023
No, there's got to be something else
that you can do.

20:38.185 --> 20:40.577
I mean, what skills do you have?

20:40.748 --> 20:42.547
I don't know.

20:43.110 --> 20:46.071
I can make my pecs dance.

20:49.917 --> 20:53.117
I can pick up a dollar bill
with my butt cheeks.

20:54.722 --> 20:59.356
I can go to that special place
inside me where I feel no shame.

21:01.048 --> 21:03.770
So maybe something in an office.

21:04.852 --> 21:07.129
Or you could... You could teach stripping.

21:07.294 --> 21:10.973
You know, share your gift.
Pass the torch.

21:12.540 --> 21:15.261
You know, actually,
that's not a bad idea.

21:15.422 --> 21:19.625
I could do it out of my apartment.
I don't think my mom would mind.

21:20.548 --> 21:23.064
There you go. Okay.
You think you're gonna be okay?

21:23.230 --> 21:24.950
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:25.112 --> 21:27.344
This is so weird.

21:27.515 --> 21:30.111
You never know when it's gonna be
your last dance.

21:31.198 --> 21:34.352
And I didn't even get a chance
to finish it.

21:37.605 --> 21:39.244
Finish it.

21:40.768 --> 21:44.161
- What?
- Your last dance. Do it for us.

21:45.172 --> 21:47.894
- Really?
- Really?

21:49.216 --> 21:54.056
Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do
the thing he loves one last time.

21:55.062 --> 21:57.943
Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.

21:58.105 --> 21:59.859
Okay.

22:30.898 --> 22:33.050
Oh, this is so hot!

22:37.545 --> 22:39.583
Oh, no, don't stop.

22:39.747 --> 22:41.705
Have to.

22:45.553 --> 22:48.274
Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
Joey, Gene, you guys ready?

22:48.435 --> 22:50.668
- Yeah.
- Sure.

22:51.278 --> 22:54.114
Okay. Give me 60 seconds
on the clock, please.

22:55.723 --> 22:56.998
Ready? Go.

22:58.606 --> 23:00.997
Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.

23:01.168 --> 23:02.922
I don't know. Types of trees...?

23:05.893 --> 23:08.933
Buenos dias. Enchilada. Por favor.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.897
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I don't know any Spanish words.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.536
A match. A candle.

23:15.703 --> 23:17.616
Things that go:
When you put them out.

23:17.825 --> 23:19.943
A torch. A bonfire.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.783
- Your pee.
- Things that burn.

23:24.672 --> 23:27.234
"I'd like to go for a walk."
"Scratch my belly."

23:27.434 --> 23:29.313
Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.039
"I have fur." "I like to bark."

23:32.199 --> 23:33.474
What a dog says.

23:35.082 --> 23:36.517
- Pepperoni.
- Pizza toppings!

23:37.845 --> 23:40.486
Cindy Crawford. Christie Brinkley.
Heidi Klum.

23:42.890 --> 23:45.167
Claudia Schiffer. Christy Turlington.
Kate Moss.

23:45.332 --> 23:47.530
Girls Chandler could never get?

23:47.735 --> 23:49.728
- Supermodels.
- Where?

23:54.101 --> 23:56.059
Hey. Where's Rachel?

23:56.223 --> 23:59.184
She and Phoebe took the stripper
to the hospital.

24:00.948 --> 24:03.180
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?

24:03.350 --> 24:06.744
- What? When was this?
- 1987.

24:06.914 --> 24:09.271
The weekend you guys
visited me at school.

24:09.436 --> 24:12.796
- Oh, my God. That's wild.
- But it was, like, a million years ago.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.680
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

24:14.842 --> 24:16.960
- Why?
- Because the night you kissed Rachel...

24:17.124 --> 24:20.039
...was the night I kissed Rachel
for the very first time.

24:20.207 --> 24:23.567
- You kissed her that night too?
- Two guys in one night?

24:23.731 --> 24:27.329
Oh, I thought she became a slut
after she got her nose fixed.

24:28.495 --> 24:30.488
- Seriously, where did this happen?
- Okay...

24:30.658 --> 24:33.128
...after you told me she was
passed out in our room...

24:33.300 --> 24:35.578
...I went in there to make sure
she was all right.

24:35.743 --> 24:39.295
She was lying on my bed,
all buried in people's coats.

24:39.466 --> 24:41.265
I went to kiss her on the forehead...

24:41.428 --> 24:43.740
...but it was so dark,
I accidentally got her lips.

24:43.911 --> 24:47.384
I started to pull away, but then
I felt her start to kiss me back.

24:47.555 --> 24:50.595
It was only for a second,
but it was amazing.

24:50.758 --> 24:54.071
And now I find out
that you kissed her first.

24:54.241 --> 24:57.316
- Wait, what bed did you say she was on?
- Mine.

24:57.484 --> 25:00.639
- I'm sure I put her on my bed.
- No, she was definitely on my bed.

25:00.808 --> 25:04.201
Why would I kiss a girl
and then put her on your bed?

25:04.371 --> 25:05.852
Well, then who was on my bed?

25:09.657 --> 25:11.410
No! No!

25:11.579 --> 25:13.856
Yes!

25:14.021 --> 25:18.257
- You were under the pile of coats?
- I was the pile of coats!

25:21.228 --> 25:23.586
Oh, my God!

25:24.071 --> 25:27.430
You were my midnight mystery kisser?!

25:28.315 --> 25:31.071
You were my first kiss with Rachel?!

25:32.119 --> 25:34.636
You were my first kiss ever?!

25:36.964 --> 25:39.434
What did I marry into?!

26:11.999 --> 26:14.276
Crap!

26:16.283 --> 26:18.276
