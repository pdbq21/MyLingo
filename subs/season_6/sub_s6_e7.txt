WEBVTT

00:02.369 --> 00:03.631
Ready?

00:04.437 --> 00:07.372
Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
Please...

00:07.574 --> 00:09.269
-Leave..
-Leave.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.208
But I just said "leave."

00:12.479 --> 00:15.312
I know because you have
all the good words.

00:15.715 --> 00:20.243
What do I get? I get "it's," "and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a." Forget it.

00:20.987 --> 00:23.547
-That's silly.
-All right. So let's switch.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.984
No, I have all the good words.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.552
Okay, fine, fine.
We can switch.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.662
- Hi...
-everybody...

00:32.899 --> 00:33.888
-It's...
-Rachel...

00:34.100 --> 00:35.089
-and...
-Phoebe's.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.426
Wait. How did you do that?

00:37.670 --> 00:39.103
What?

00:39.973 --> 00:42.806
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.239
This is gonna be interesting.

00:46.312 --> 00:49.975
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.681
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?

00:52.919 --> 00:57.652
It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.324
Okay, let's go running!

00:59.592 --> 01:01.992
-There's cute guys there.
-Let's run towards them!

01:03.830 --> 01:05.593
Wait just one more second.

01:05.865 --> 01:08.595
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

01:09.402 --> 01:11.700
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!

01:11.905 --> 01:14.533
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!

01:16.409 --> 01:18.343
The One Where Phoebe Runs

01:53.780 --> 01:56.578
I just finished this
fascinating book.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.977
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers...

02:00.253 --> 02:05.247
that can carry out the same amount
of functions as a human brain.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.617
So, theoretically,
you could download...

02:07.827 --> 02:11.263
your thoughts and memories
into this computer...

02:11.564 --> 02:15.728
and live forever as a machine.

02:19.906 --> 02:23.740
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.614
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

02:33.786 --> 02:37.119
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!

02:38.658 --> 02:42.355
And while I'm doing that, Ross has
a great computer story for you.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.599
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet Janine.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.802
She's gonna be my new roommate!

02:54.174 --> 02:56.165
And she's gonna live with me!

02:58.044 --> 02:59.875
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?

03:00.146 --> 03:01.340
Le Croix.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.344
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.216
So where are you from?

03:07.487 --> 03:09.455
Australia.
I just moved here.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.123
From the land down under?

03:11.324 --> 03:13.383
I didn't know that either!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.286
So what do you do?

03:16.496 --> 03:19.294
-I'm a dancer.
-You're a dancer?

03:19.632 --> 03:21.532
She's a dancer!

03:23.736 --> 03:26.136
I think I'll go unpack.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.079
Did you interview her
before you asked her to move in?

03:40.386 --> 03:41.876
Of course!

03:42.055 --> 03:43.545
What did you ask her?

03:43.823 --> 03:45.552
When can you move in?

03:48.094 --> 03:50.995
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.264
Unbelievable.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.726
Down, boy.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.462
Oh, no, no, no. She's not my type.
Not for me, she's not my type. She's too..

03:58.638 --> 04:01.801
Beautiful, tall, sexy,
showing her stomach?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.704
Look at all the boxes!

04:05.612 --> 04:07.876
I cannot wait to ask her out.

04:08.114 --> 04:11.379
Wait a minute.
You can't. She's your roommate.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.016
It'll be too complicated.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.719
Yeah, don't do it.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.321
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

04:19.359 --> 04:22.624
What if you started going out with her
and it didn't work out?

04:22.795 --> 04:24.558
That's when I make my move.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.331
Remember when you broke up
with Donna...

04:28.501 --> 04:31.800
how horrible it was when you
bumped into her at the supermarket?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.470
Oh, God, yeah.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.300
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

04:36.576 --> 04:37.736
Okay!

04:40.947 --> 04:44.246
You're right! I don't want that.
I can't date her.

04:44.484 --> 04:48.511
You'd better watch the flirting too,
because it could be trouble.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.584
Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

04:50.857 --> 04:54.190
It's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

04:55.261 --> 04:58.287
You're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.599
A little sad about that, sweetie?

05:07.140 --> 05:10.371
I have to tie my shoes, so you
go ahead. I'll catch up.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.381
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!

05:24.157 --> 05:26.318
I'm telling you, when she runs...

05:26.559 --> 05:28.652
she looks like Kermit the Frog...

05:28.895 --> 05:30.886
and the Six Million Dollar Man.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.656
Monica had such a crush on him.

05:35.902 --> 05:40.362
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.765
I used to do that too!

05:42.041 --> 05:45.374
Did you also have his album,
"It's Not Easy Being Green"?

05:47.246 --> 05:49.111
Oh, Mon.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.080
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.382
Yeah. And I know she'll
want to run again.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.557
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.851
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.588
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

06:07.800 --> 06:12.032
Phoebe, Monica tripped me. I don't
think I can ever run again, ever!

06:13.639 --> 06:17.370
But we were having so much fun.
All those cute guys were checking us out.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.535
I know. They were definitely staring.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.142
Why? Why would you do that?

06:24.650 --> 06:26.379
I don't know.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.414
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.154
-Ankle.
-We'll see.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.059
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.993
Thanks for helping me, man.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.890
Joe?

06:49.509 --> 06:51.773
Well, I guess Joey went home.

06:52.745 --> 06:56.408
And look, there is still one box
I have to unpack.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.216
I got you!

07:02.922 --> 07:06.119
Oh, my God, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.427
It was so hard not to laugh.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.355
Hey, the place looks great.

07:12.632 --> 07:13.690
Not bad, right?

07:13.966 --> 07:17.800
Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.700
You know what else I'll do?

07:19.972 --> 07:22.805
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get her some flowers.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.906
Who wouldn't want to live with me?

07:25.378 --> 07:26.470
I don't.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.909
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer!

07:31.217 --> 07:34.084
How's that going? Are you okay
with the not-flirting thing?

07:34.320 --> 07:36.151
So far. But it's tough.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.552
I've got this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.955
How you doing?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.866
Get out!

07:54.273 --> 07:55.900
Oh, man!

07:57.376 --> 07:59.674
Sorry. There's just
more room out here.

07:59.912 --> 08:05.043
No, you just reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.915
Why don't you try to be...?

08:14.193 --> 08:15.592
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.591
I didn't want you to touch me...

08:17.864 --> 08:20.924
because I'm all sweaty
from the workout.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.799
I'm gonna hit the shower.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.564
Oh, my God!

08:27.773 --> 08:29.741
Sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.809
It's just my thongs are
too delicate for the dryer.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.482
Oh, yeah, it's me.

08:47.727 --> 08:50.787
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.291
You lied so you could run by yourself.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.557
No, Phoebe, no. I was....

08:55.801 --> 08:57.428
I was actually just checking...

08:57.670 --> 08:58.796
to see...

08:59.005 --> 09:00.768
if I could run. And I can!

09:01.007 --> 09:02.440
Please, I'm not an idiot.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.004
No, wait. Phoebe?

09:16.689 --> 09:19.658
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

09:21.327 --> 09:25.093
I am working right now. So say what you
have to say and leave me alone!

09:25.665 --> 09:27.758
Sound alike too.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.866
So, Mondler....

09:33.706 --> 09:36.402
What are you doing?

09:36.676 --> 09:38.803
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.377
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all her stuff?

09:42.715 --> 09:45.183
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.682
Put it back exactly
where you found it?

09:47.887 --> 09:51.152
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.915
First of all,
that attitude is not helping.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.491
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.224
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

10:02.268 --> 10:05.237
She'll recognize
that I did a nice thing...

10:05.504 --> 10:07.165
and appreciate it.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.864
Actually, this will work out well.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.010
Because when you move back
with Joey...

10:12.244 --> 10:15.236
Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.373
Oh, I see. You're trying
to freak me out.

10:18.584 --> 10:23.214
Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

10:23.456 --> 10:28.120
Believe me, I lived with her for
16 years. She's going to freak out.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.852
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.225
That probably won't hurt as much anymore.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.028
No, she is not.
I'll prove it to you.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.998
I'll call her right now.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.704
Phone's done.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.909
-Hey, Mon. How's it going?
-Terrible.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.477
If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.377
Other people just wreck stuff.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.483
I think I might kill someone tonight.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.055
Come on, it can't be that bad.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.021
The only thing getting me through...

11:02.228 --> 11:04.162
is knowing I'll see you soon.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.594
I might even try
to get out of here early.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.663
It sounds like they need you there.

11:09.935 --> 11:13.496
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
-It's all good! Okay, bye!

11:15.374 --> 11:16.739
She's gonna kill me.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.708
The phone was facing the other way.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.911
And that goes back up there.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.443
This is good. This is under control.
We should start with the big stuff.

11:28.621 --> 11:32.057
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.

11:33.659 --> 11:34.683
I got it.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.529
That doesn't look right.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.894
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.

11:44.136 --> 11:48.402
Then I can just walk over here
and casually put my feet up on....

11:49.742 --> 11:51.369
Okay, here's what we do.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.010
We move the couch
closer to the coffee table.

11:54.246 --> 11:57.238
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the carpet.

11:57.516 --> 12:00.576
Well, we'll just move
the coffee table...

12:00.753 --> 12:01.742
closer to the couch.

12:02.054 --> 12:07.185
But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.927
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table!

12:14.700 --> 12:16.463
Look, what am I gonna do?

12:16.635 --> 12:21.163
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame!

12:26.479 --> 12:28.913
What the hell's going on over here?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.948
Monica's gonna kill you!

12:33.619 --> 12:34.779
I need your help.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.615
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.689
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.757
You guys repel women all the time!

12:44.363 --> 12:46.957
Hey, I've been married three times.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.130
No, I've seen it happen.

12:54.373 --> 12:58.173
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

12:58.844 --> 13:02.143
Time after time after time after time.

13:02.314 --> 13:03.576
What's your secret?

13:05.151 --> 13:07.346
We do not repel women, okay?

13:07.586 --> 13:09.281
That is completely untrue.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.116
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.090
Remember when we went to a dance...

13:15.361 --> 13:18.421
and you walked up to that girl
you liked and talked...

13:18.664 --> 13:21.132
about the lrish potato famine?

13:22.034 --> 13:25.003
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.535
After everything he said,
he'd go..

13:30.276 --> 13:33.507
Monica doesn't like that either.
I should stop doing that.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.372
Girls don't like it when
I start talking about science.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.811
That's not specific to girls.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.687
This is great. What else?

13:43.956 --> 13:45.719
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.449
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

13:50.863 --> 13:54.697
They don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.470
-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
-I'm never gonna find love again.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.371
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

14:13.085 --> 14:16.316
Phoebe, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?

14:16.555 --> 14:18.716
I handled the situation horribly.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.323
And I should not have lied to you.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.229
So what should you have done?

14:24.597 --> 14:26.724
I should have told you the truth.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.200
Which is?

14:29.768 --> 14:34.603
Well, the reason I didn't
want to go running with you is...

14:35.241 --> 14:36.401
because...

14:36.609 --> 14:39.942
the way that you run
is just a little....

14:42.514 --> 14:43.947
-So?
-It's embarrassing.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.411
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.452
-Why do you care?
-Because they're people!

14:50.089 --> 14:52.717
People you don't know
and will never see again.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.085
Yes, but still they are people...

14:55.361 --> 14:56.623
with eyes.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.531
I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss....

15:04.436 --> 15:05.767
But okay.

15:05.971 --> 15:10.203
I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.070
Okay. You're uptight.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.042
What? I am not uptight.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.943
I am not uptight, man.

15:22.788 --> 15:26.121
That's okay. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.825
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid...

15:30.062 --> 15:32.792
because that's the only way
it's fun, you know?

15:33.065 --> 15:36.466
Didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...

15:36.669 --> 15:41.572
Like when you were running towards
the swings or running away from Satan?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.335
The neighbor's dog.

15:51.317 --> 15:52.807
Is this in the right place?

15:53.018 --> 15:55.248
Who cares? I repel women.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.088
You can't come in here!

16:00.326 --> 16:01.987
Ross is naked!

16:07.533 --> 16:10.866
I couldn't say I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.435
Why does anyone have to be naked?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.799
Why is Ross naked?

16:20.279 --> 16:24.045
I had to show Chandler something.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.577
Naked?

16:30.856 --> 16:32.790
I guess I have...

16:33.392 --> 16:35.189
a "guy" problem.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.692
Is it the same thing
Chandler had?

16:43.168 --> 16:47.195
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later!

16:47.406 --> 16:51.502
There's still some of Chandler's
medicine in the bathroom.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.477
-Bye.
-Bye!

17:00.552 --> 17:01.712
Thank God.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.152
Dude, what'd you have?

17:08.927 --> 17:11.657
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.695
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.856
The photo album!

17:16.101 --> 17:19.935
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.730
We just match everything
to the pictures!

17:23.008 --> 17:25.272
That's perfect! That's brilliant!

17:28.247 --> 17:29.373
What'd you have?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.777
I've got some beer for you.

17:36.121 --> 17:39.215
Don't you mean "for whom"?

17:41.193 --> 17:42.285
Sure.

17:43.362 --> 17:46.195
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

17:46.432 --> 17:49.731
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

17:53.038 --> 17:54.266
Is something wrong?

17:54.506 --> 17:58.966
Yeah. I'm depressed about that
Irish potato famine.

17:59.912 --> 18:04.212
No, I mean with me. Because you seem
to be acting really weird around me.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.446
All right, all right.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.586
Let's just get this
out in the open, okay?

18:10.856 --> 18:12.619
You're hot.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.416
I'm lovable.

18:15.527 --> 18:19.190
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.557
But we're roommates...

18:20.799 --> 18:24.462
and it's a huge mistake
for us to continue down this road.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.262
Imagine living in a supermarket...

18:28.474 --> 18:29.907
and you'll understand.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.808
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

18:36.048 --> 18:37.640
There isn't anything to do.

18:37.916 --> 18:40.407
I think you're really sweet.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.213
But I'm not interested
in you like that.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.251
No, I mean....

18:52.297 --> 18:57.166
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.404
I'm just, you know, I just...

18:59.671 --> 19:02.834
don't feel that way about you.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.601
I see what happened.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.910
It's because I was trying
to repel you.

19:11.116 --> 19:16.019
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.454
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.462
How you doing?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.932
I'm okay.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.962
What?

19:31.136 --> 19:32.125
What?

19:33.138 --> 19:34.969
Oh, dear God!

19:56.662 --> 19:59.222
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great!

19:59.498 --> 20:03.366
And you don't care if people stare.
It's only a second. Then you're gone!

20:04.469 --> 20:07.961
It's amazing!
I feel so free and so graceful!

20:13.312 --> 20:14.836
Watch out for the horse.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.044
Can I come in now?

20:31.997 --> 20:34.329
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.

20:37.436 --> 20:38.835
I don't see anything different...

20:39.071 --> 20:43.735
other than the fact that the room
got brighter when you came into it.

20:44.343 --> 20:47.210
The end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre...

20:47.446 --> 20:50.711
and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.209
Okay, don't be mad, okay?

20:54.586 --> 20:58.613
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
to do something nice for you...

20:58.890 --> 21:01.791
so I cleaned the apartment.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.554
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...

21:05.864 --> 21:09.095
where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.430
That's okay.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.232
Are you afraid of me or something?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.042
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

21:19.244 --> 21:20.973
Of course not.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.743
My gosh, Chandler, what you did
is a wonderful thing...

21:24.983 --> 21:26.780
and I really appreciate it.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.444
I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.156
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

21:33.825 --> 21:35.122
Really?

21:35.894 --> 21:37.054
Of course.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.586
Oh, you're the best.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.489
You come here to me.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.829
Hold on, okay?
First things first.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.505
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.243
It said that by the year 2030...

21:56.481 --> 21:59.644
there'll be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...

21:59.885 --> 22:01.910
as an actual human brain.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.553
So, theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...

22:05.824 --> 22:07.985
and your memories
into this computer..

22:08.193 --> 22:10.559
And live forever as a machine.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.528
Janine, do you know
what we're doing right now?

22:19.938 --> 22:22.566
You and I, we're interfacing.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.670
I gotta go.
