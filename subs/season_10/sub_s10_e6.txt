WEBVTT

00:03.691 --> 00:05.684
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:05.893 --> 00:07.327
Pheebs, what's wrong?

00:07.494 --> 00:10.808
I'm just so exhausted from dragging
around this huge engagement ring.

00:11.018 --> 00:13.660
- Oh, my God.
- Congratulations.

00:13.861 --> 00:16.662
So did he get on one knee?
Did he have a speech prepared?

00:16.824 --> 00:18.578
Oh, did he cry?

00:20.708 --> 00:23.703
Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals.

00:24.431 --> 00:28.509
Well, it was really sweet,
and, like, the most romantic thing ever.

00:28.676 --> 00:31.796
Here's to Phoebe, who's found
the greatest guy in the world.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.069
To Phoebe and...

00:33.240 --> 00:35.392
I want to say "Mike"?

00:35.843 --> 00:38.234
- To Phoebe and Mike.
- Hey.

00:38.445 --> 00:41.008
Thank you. Oh, and I have
something for you.

00:41.168 --> 00:44.642
It's my little black book. It's got
the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

00:44.852 --> 00:48.690
Oh, Phoebe, that's nice,
but you know what? I think I'm okay.

00:48.856 --> 00:51.247
Give it to one
of your other single girlfriends.

00:51.458 --> 00:53.611
I would, but you're the last one.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.142
Give me the book!

00:58.305 --> 01:00.104
"Pablo Diaz.

01:00.267 --> 01:02.021
Brady Smith.

01:02.870 --> 01:04.510
Guy in Van"?

01:04.672 --> 01:06.425
Oh, my first love.

01:07.875 --> 01:10.915
What is the red X next
to Bob Gremore's name mean?

01:11.118 --> 01:12.951
Dead.

01:14.161 --> 01:17.440
Oh, it's okay. No, he was old. Yeah.

01:17.645 --> 01:21.608
And he lived a full life. He was
in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.971
I should've given you guys
my black book when I got married.

01:25.132 --> 01:27.729
Although, it wasn't so much
a book as a napkin.

01:29.096 --> 01:31.248
With Janice's phone number on it.

01:32.219 --> 01:34.941
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

01:39.106 --> 01:40.507
Oh, yes, they are.

01:42.510 --> 01:44.582
The One With Ross' Grant

02:19.907 --> 02:21.421
Hey, honey.

02:22.189 --> 02:23.670
Hey, sweetie.

02:24.271 --> 02:25.865
- Is Monica not here?
- No.

02:26.033 --> 02:29.552
Then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding
for a big account, and they got it.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.153
- It's my first national commercial.
- Cool.

02:32.359 --> 02:35.195
And I don't want to brag,
but a lot of the ideas were mine.

02:35.362 --> 02:38.482
Hell, you weren't there.
All the ideas were mine.

02:38.646 --> 02:41.846
That's great.
Hey, can you cast me in it?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.921
I really don't think
you're right for the part.

02:45.092 --> 02:48.691
What do you mean?
I can do anything. I'm a chameleon.

02:50.017 --> 02:51.850
I'm old.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.060
I'm tired.

02:55.222 --> 02:59.857
Oh, I am hot. I'm cold.
Come on, what can't I do?

03:00.988 --> 03:03.185
First of all, bravo.

03:04.111 --> 03:07.869
But I don't think you're right for this.
The part's a stuffy college professor.

03:08.035 --> 03:11.793
I can do that.
Hello, I'm your professor.

03:11.959 --> 03:16.400
When I'm not busy thinking
of important things, or professing...

03:17.685 --> 03:19.564
...I like to use...
What's the product?

03:19.767 --> 03:23.240
Software that facilitates
inter-business networking e-solutions.

03:28.095 --> 03:29.324
I'm cold.

03:32.419 --> 03:33.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:34.101 --> 03:36.458
Guess who's a finalist
for a huge research grant?

03:36.664 --> 03:39.226
I'll give you a hint.
He's looking right at you.

03:39.867 --> 03:42.907
Well, unless it's the creepy guy
with his hand up his kilt...

03:43.070 --> 03:45.507
...I'm gonna say, "Congratulations."

03:45.713 --> 03:50.029
I'm so excited. Apparently, I beat out
hundreds of other applicants...

03:50.197 --> 03:52.668
...including five guys
I went to graduate school with.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.755
Not that I'm keeping score,
or anything. Five.

03:56.644 --> 03:57.964
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.519
- So tell me about the grant.
- Well, okay, it's for $25,000.

04:01.729 --> 04:04.724
And if I get it, I'll be able
to complete my field research.

04:04.932 --> 04:08.565
And there will be an article about me
in the Paleontology Review.

04:08.736 --> 04:10.968
It'll be the first time
my name is in there...

04:11.138 --> 04:13.860
...without people raising
serious questions about my work.

04:14.862 --> 04:17.902
- Are you talking about the Dewer Grant?
- Yeah. Why?

04:18.105 --> 04:20.143
Benjamin Hobart
is administering that grant.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.305
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.

04:22.469 --> 04:26.831
So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
if your new boyfriend gets this grant?

04:26.994 --> 04:29.670
Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.069
No. No, we ended on great terms.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.961
If anything, I think this could
help you. You know what?

04:35.122 --> 04:38.117
Why don't we all go out to dinner,
and I can introduce you.

04:38.285 --> 04:40.927
- If you think it'd help.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.

04:41.088 --> 04:43.651
Now, is there anything I could
do to butter him up?

04:43.811 --> 04:45.370
Anything he really likes?

04:46.774 --> 04:48.846
He does have
a pretty serious latex fetish.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.527
We'll see how dinner goes.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.818
- Hey.
- Hey, you want to go see a movie?

04:57.985 --> 05:01.424
I told you I had to spend all day
clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.

05:01.589 --> 05:03.182
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

05:03.350 --> 05:07.553
Now that I'm here, I might as well help
with the cleaning and organizing.

05:07.715 --> 05:09.753
I just happen to have my label maker.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.790
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.

05:14.001 --> 05:17.121
Did you and Chandler make compromises
when you moved in together?

05:17.444 --> 05:18.879
Chandler did.

05:19.847 --> 05:22.283
- What does he want you to give up?
- A bunch of stuff.

05:22.449 --> 05:25.444
And the worst one,
he wants me to get rid of Gladys.

05:25.853 --> 05:27.971
Who's Gladys?

05:30.658 --> 05:33.379
Oh, what a tragic loss.

05:33.941 --> 05:38.223
Yeah, I really hate to give her up.
Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.

05:40.868 --> 05:43.863
Oh, I don't know.

05:44.071 --> 05:49.469
- What, you don't like her?
- Of course I do. What's not to like?

05:50.157 --> 05:52.468
I'd take her in a minute.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.633
But I think that you're
giving up too easy.

05:54.802 --> 05:57.318
I think that you need
to fight for her.

05:58.085 --> 06:00.203
- Really, you think?
- Absolutely.

06:00.407 --> 06:03.129
You say to him, "I'm sorry, Mike,
I can't live without her.

06:03.290 --> 06:05.487
She means too much to me."

06:05.813 --> 06:09.092
Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.

06:09.256 --> 06:12.570
Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,
that means you don't get her.

06:12.780 --> 06:14.659
Damn it, I did not think this through.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.105
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

06:20.267 --> 06:21.987
Oh, any word on casting yet?

06:22.149 --> 06:25.189
- I told you, you're not right for the part.
- What do you mean?

06:25.392 --> 06:29.355
Rach, don't I seem like a professor
you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

06:30.397 --> 06:33.837
I'm sorry, this sounds like something
I'm never gonna be interested in.

06:34.602 --> 06:38.724
Look, come on, please? It's not like
I'm asking you for some crazy favor.

06:38.886 --> 06:41.642
This is what I do for a living.
I am a professional actor.

06:41.809 --> 06:43.722
Man, I'm two hours late for work.

06:45.533 --> 06:48.608
Here's my reel. It's got all
the commercials that I've been in.

06:48.816 --> 06:50.375
- Joe...
- Just watch it.

06:50.538 --> 06:53.213
If you don't like it,
don't pass it on to your bosses.

06:53.420 --> 06:56.221
- Fine.
- Thank you.

07:00.027 --> 07:02.624
- Work, Joe.
- Damn it.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.184
- What am I gonna do now?
- Just pass the tape along.

07:08.355 --> 07:10.029
He's not right for the part.

07:10.237 --> 07:12.629
If I suggest him,
my bosses will think I'm an idiot.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.316
And that's something
they should learn on their own.

07:15.482 --> 07:17.440
Just tell Joey
that you watched the tape...

07:17.605 --> 07:19.598
...and you liked it,
but your bosses didn't.

07:19.767 --> 07:22.203
Then you're the good guy,
and they're the bad guy.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.564
That's good. I liked it, they didn't.

07:26.974 --> 07:29.444
Joey, for God's sake, go to work.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.383
I can't believe I'm about
to meet Benjamin Hobart.

07:37.585 --> 07:39.942
I've always thought of him
as someone I'd invite...

07:40.107 --> 07:42.498
...to my fantasy dinner party.

07:43.390 --> 07:46.830
Do you think there's any chance
he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?

07:48.395 --> 07:50.992
Sorry, it looks like it's just him.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.080
Charlie.

07:56.323 --> 07:59.956
My God, you look absolutely stunning.

08:00.127 --> 08:03.088
Well, I am having a good hair day.

08:03.931 --> 08:07.483
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, you too.

08:11.018 --> 08:12.293
I'm okay.

08:13.180 --> 08:16.300
I'm sorry. Ross Geller,
Benjamin Hobart.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.424
It's an honor to meet you.
I can't tell you how long...

08:19.587 --> 08:24.381
...I've been an admirer of your work.
I mean, that Nobel Prize.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.990
I mean, I have to tell you that you're
one of the reasons I got into the field.

08:30.397 --> 08:31.957
Well, likewise.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.001
Not likewise. I'd never heard
of you until this morning.

08:36.163 --> 08:37.678
But it's nice to be nice.

08:39.687 --> 08:43.160
- Shall we?
- Yeah. Thank you.

08:45.613 --> 08:48.972
I can't believe that you chose
this restaurant.

08:49.136 --> 08:53.019
- Do you remember the night?
- Oh, my God. I completely forgot.

08:53.220 --> 08:58.299
Oh, my God, I can't believe
they let us back in this place.

09:05.032 --> 09:07.264
You weren't there.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.876
No, but, you know,
it's just a funny image.

09:11.038 --> 09:16.356
You know, the two of you
in this restaurant with the...

09:17.965 --> 09:22.885
Why don't you tell Benji about your
proposal while I go to the ladies' room.

09:24.612 --> 09:26.205
So tell me about it.

09:26.373 --> 09:30.656
Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig
in the Painted Desert.

09:30.858 --> 09:33.819
There are still several areas
that haven't been fully excavated.

09:33.981 --> 09:35.335
- Break up with Charlie.
- What?

09:35.543 --> 09:36.818
What?

09:37.945 --> 09:41.828
Did you just say,
"Break up with Charlie"?

09:42.910 --> 09:48.114
Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it.
And no, I didn't not say it.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.794
- Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
- Listen, I'm sorry.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.393
I just haven't seen her for so long,
all these feelings are rushing back.

09:56.604 --> 09:58.836
I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed her.

09:59.006 --> 10:01.283
And I'm gonna need you
to break up with her.

10:03.410 --> 10:05.881
- Are you serious?
- If you say, yes, then I'm serious.

10:06.053 --> 10:08.285
If you say, no, then I'm joking.

10:09.617 --> 10:11.370
- No.
- Joking it is.

10:15.422 --> 10:18.098
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Hey, how'd it go with Mike?

10:18.265 --> 10:22.103
- Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
- No, he really hates it.

10:22.269 --> 10:24.991
But he's gonna let me keep
my box of human hair.

10:26.273 --> 10:31.352
So you gotta pick your battles.
But the good news is, Gladys is yours.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.471
Wow, what's the bad news?

10:35.883 --> 10:38.958
- Who's Gladys?
- Oh, she's that work of art I made.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.763
You know, with the woman
coming out of the frame.

10:42.650 --> 10:46.248
And Monica gets to keep her?

10:46.413 --> 10:49.408
In her house? I am so jealous.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.251
I didn't know you wanted her too.

10:55.302 --> 10:58.662
Well, I mean, sure, of course.

10:59.146 --> 11:01.139
But you already gave that
to Monica, so...

11:01.348 --> 11:04.981
- You know, I would give her up for you.
- No, I couldn't let you do that.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.350
- No, but I want to.
- But I don't want you to.

11:07.555 --> 11:11.312
- But I insist.
- But I insist harder.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.232
Girls. Girls. Stop.
Okay, we'll flip a coin.

11:15.402 --> 11:18.557
Heads, she's Rachel's.
Tails, she's Monica's.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.521
- Tails. Monica, she's yours.
- No, that landed in your food.

11:25.573 --> 11:29.455
No, no, that's okay.
You won fair and square. I'm so sad.

11:32.660 --> 11:34.219
- Hey, Joe?
- What's up?

11:34.381 --> 11:37.296
Bad news. I watched the tape
and passed it along to my bosses...

11:37.464 --> 11:39.822
...and they weren't interested.

11:40.948 --> 11:43.511
I'm sorry, man.

11:44.672 --> 11:48.589
- But you watched the tape?
- Yeah, I liked it.

11:49.797 --> 11:55.320
But my bosses didn't go for it.
Stupid sons of bitches.

11:59.486 --> 12:03.848
- You didn't watch the tape.
- What? Of course I did.

12:04.051 --> 12:06.727
Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
but to lie to me?

12:06.934 --> 12:09.849
- I'm not lying to you. I watched it.
- You lied again.

12:10.017 --> 12:13.057
- I watched it.
- keep going, Pinocchio.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.021
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

12:16.183 --> 12:18.221
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.

12:20.147 --> 12:22.664
- Did you watch the tape?
- No.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.352
The selection committee has chosen
the three of you as our finalists.

12:29.557 --> 12:33.075
The decision will be based on the
answers you give to the questions I ask.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.714
We'll start with Dr. Li.
You claim the field is too reliant...

12:36.884 --> 12:41.086
...on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
How do you propose to correct this?

12:41.248 --> 12:44.323
I believe that the answers lie
in the osteological evidence.

12:44.491 --> 12:46.245
- I plan to begin there.
- Interesting.

12:46.694 --> 12:48.367
I guess.

12:49.376 --> 12:53.009
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some
fieldwork. Where might that take place?

12:53.180 --> 12:55.743
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region
of South Dakota.

12:55.903 --> 13:00.185
Certainly. Very well.
And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

13:06.313 --> 13:08.067
What? I...

13:09.997 --> 13:12.069
Care to venture a guess?

13:14.481 --> 13:18.364
- May 12?
- That's not even kind of close.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.599
Dr. Li, how many graduate students
will you need?

13:21.809 --> 13:23.688
- Half a dozen.
- I see. And Dr. Biely?

13:23.851 --> 13:26.083
Three for excavation,
and two for analysis.

13:26.253 --> 13:29.932
Certainly. Dr. Geller,
which 1965 Shirelles hit...

13:30.097 --> 13:33.172
...was later covered by
a popular British Invasion band?

13:36.704 --> 13:39.095
What? I need six graduate students.

13:39.306 --> 13:42.985
No, I'm sorry.
We were looking for "Baby It's You."

13:43.150 --> 13:44.379
"Baby It's You."

13:46.033 --> 13:48.151
What? Wait just a minute.

13:48.315 --> 13:51.390
None of my questions have anything
to do with paleontology.

13:51.559 --> 13:53.950
You're right, I apologize.
Scratch the last question.

13:54.121 --> 13:56.193
Spell "Boscodictiasaur."

13:58.445 --> 14:01.646
I've never heard
of a "Boscodictiasaur."

14:01.809 --> 14:04.041
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

14:06.774 --> 14:10.053
- Okay. B-O...
- No, it starts with a silent M.

14:10.257 --> 14:12.329
Oh, come on!

14:18.786 --> 14:22.304
I can't believe Joey.
I hate being called a liar.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.830
But you are a liar.

14:25.192 --> 14:26.991
What did I just say?

14:28.395 --> 14:29.591
- Are you still here?
- Yes.

14:29.757 --> 14:34.039
And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.
When I tell somebody I did something...

14:34.201 --> 14:38.198
Okay, hold on, let me just stop you
right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?

14:38.365 --> 14:40.836
Then you lied about lying, okay?

14:41.008 --> 14:43.730
Then you lied about lying
about lying, okay?

14:43.891 --> 14:49.129
So before you lie about lying
about lying about lying about lying...

14:50.938 --> 14:52.817
Stop lying.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.537
Why are you so sure
I didn't watch this tape?

14:55.703 --> 14:57.696
You wanna know why?
You wanna know why?

14:58.225 --> 15:00.058
Well, this is going well.

15:01.428 --> 15:03.022
Here's how I know.

15:03.230 --> 15:07.865
If you had seen what was on this tape,
believe me, you'd have some comments.

15:08.035 --> 15:10.711
All right, remember,
I got paid a lot of money for this...

15:10.918 --> 15:13.036
...and it only aired in Japan.

15:13.881 --> 15:15.440
Ichiban.

15:16.844 --> 15:18.962
Ichiban, lipstick for men.

15:31.178 --> 15:34.093
Ichiban, lipstick for men.

15:37.665 --> 15:39.976
And that's how I know
you didn't watch the tape.

15:42.910 --> 15:45.187
He really is a chameleon.

15:51.879 --> 15:55.922
Well, Gladys, say hello
to your new home.

15:58.966 --> 16:01.529
- Oh, my.
- Wow.

16:01.689 --> 16:04.764
Oh, she is so nice and big.

16:06.574 --> 16:12.495
Oh, Monica, where are you going
to display Gladys, oh, so proudly?

16:13.501 --> 16:17.578
- I haven't really settled on a spot yet.
- How about right above the TV?

16:17.745 --> 16:22.027
That way, it will be the first thing
that you see when you walk in the door.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.510
Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid
of that French poster.

16:26.714 --> 16:28.547
- I like that poster.
- Really?

16:28.996 --> 16:31.068
It doesn't have anything
coming out of it.

16:31.919 --> 16:34.435
Or maybe there's someplace
for her in your bedroom?

16:34.642 --> 16:38.240
- There's nothing above your bed.
- Are you still here?

16:41.448 --> 16:43.361
Oh, hi. Hello.

16:43.531 --> 16:47.608
Have you come to ask me some more
paleontology-related questions?

16:47.775 --> 16:51.738
Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?
Ann-Margaret's pant size?

16:54.061 --> 16:58.263
I've come here to apologize.
I think I may have let my feelings...

16:58.425 --> 17:01.181
...for Charlie interfere
with the interview process.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.381
No. Stop!

17:04.071 --> 17:06.872
Anyway, I decided
to offer you the grant.

17:08.516 --> 17:12.832
- Really?
- There is just one small stipulation.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.993
- I have to break up with Charlie?
- Hey, you got one right.

17:18.526 --> 17:22.682
- You're crazy.
- Crazy or romantic?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.445
Crazy.

17:26.854 --> 17:28.447
- Or?
- Get out!

17:35.222 --> 17:36.212
Oh, my God.

17:38.225 --> 17:42.347
- What?
- Joey, what is this thing doing here?

17:42.510 --> 17:47.190
I got her from Monica. She sold it
to me for a very reasonable price.

17:47.394 --> 17:50.834
- Joey, we're not keeping this.
- But it's an original Buffay.

17:53.881 --> 17:56.523
All right, fine. You can keep it.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.916
As long as you don't mind
that she's haunted.

17:59.126 --> 18:00.561
Hey, what? What?

18:00.968 --> 18:05.284
Well, legend has it, Joey, that she
comes alive when you're asleep.

18:07.535 --> 18:10.415
She climbs out of the frame...

18:10.618 --> 18:14.695
...and then drags her half-a-body
across the floor...

18:14.862 --> 18:16.616
...just looking for legs to steal.

18:18.065 --> 18:20.262
And then with her one good hand...

18:20.427 --> 18:24.265
...she slowly reaches up...

18:24.431 --> 18:26.550
...and turns your doorknob.

18:26.754 --> 18:30.352
Get that legless witch out of here!

18:35.523 --> 18:38.483
- Hey, I sold that to Joey.
- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.

18:38.646 --> 18:41.481
- Two can play at this game.
- Too late. You can't give it back.

18:41.649 --> 18:43.767
- Oh, yes, I can.
- No, you can't, she's yours.

18:43.971 --> 18:45.246
- She's yours.
- She's yours.

18:45.412 --> 18:47.724
- She's yours.
- Hey.

18:49.256 --> 18:50.657
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

18:50.818 --> 18:52.651
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

18:52.860 --> 18:55.935
You guys, you don't have
to fight over her anymore.

18:56.263 --> 18:59.383
Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
gets Glynnis.

19:07.274 --> 19:09.346
- I want Gladys.
- She's mine.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.429
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

19:14.642 --> 19:17.442
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't give them your tape.

19:17.605 --> 19:21.487
And I promise next time to submit you,
whether I think you're right or not.

19:21.689 --> 19:24.489
That's not the point, Chandler.
The point is that you lied.

19:24.652 --> 19:29.093
I know. You're right. What's it
gonna take for you to forgive me?

19:29.296 --> 19:30.332
Oh, my God.

19:34.421 --> 19:36.379
Excellent.

19:37.304 --> 19:39.616
Now what do you say?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.905
Lying is wrong.

19:42.069 --> 19:44.426
And? And?!

19:46.153 --> 19:48.829
I'm a pretty little girl.

19:50.437 --> 19:51.792
I knew it.

19:59.126 --> 20:02.326
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.406
- Did you get the grant?
- No. And you wanna know why?

20:05.573 --> 20:08.773
Because your ex-boyfriend
is still in love with you.

20:08.936 --> 20:09.926
What?

20:10.097 --> 20:12.294
He refused me
because I wouldn't give you up.

20:12.499 --> 20:15.654
Benji isn't in love with me.
I mean, he broke up with me.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.900
- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
- Really?

20:20.628 --> 20:23.224
Is it ethical to ask someone
in a grant review:

20:23.390 --> 20:25.223
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"

20:26.033 --> 20:27.467
I'm sure he was just joking.

20:27.635 --> 20:29.787
If you don't believe me,
let's go talk to him.

20:29.997 --> 20:32.912
I'm telling you, he didn't ask me
one paleontological question.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.956
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:

20:36.123 --> 20:38.275
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"

20:38.485 --> 20:41.845
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
in Congo, then M-B-O...

20:42.049 --> 20:43.119
Damn it.

20:46.654 --> 20:49.729
Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are
you doing here?

20:49.937 --> 20:51.691
I want you to tell her everything.

20:51.859 --> 20:55.411
About the deal you tried to make
with me, about the crazy questions you...

20:55.743 --> 21:00.663
Wally Cox.
That's the voice of Underdog.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.421
Like I tried to tell you
in the interview...

21:03.591 --> 21:07.382
...this grant is not based on your
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

21:07.555 --> 21:12.349
No, don't do that. I want you to look
her in the eyes and tell her the truth.

21:13.521 --> 21:14.591
Benji?

21:15.723 --> 21:20.278
It's true. I behaved horribly,
but it's only because I still love you.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.328
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.

21:23.531 --> 21:26.047
Too little, too late, Benji.

21:27.094 --> 21:31.057
- I can't believe this.
- I never should've broken up with you.

21:31.218 --> 21:36.058
I think about you all the time.
Do you ever still think about me?

21:36.263 --> 21:37.664
No.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.703
- Yes.
- What?

21:41.509 --> 21:45.300
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...

21:45.472 --> 21:47.465
...romantic.

21:47.955 --> 21:49.435
Or?

21:52.079 --> 21:54.117
I know I may be
way out of bounds here...

21:54.321 --> 21:57.635
...but is there any chance
you would take me back?

22:00.087 --> 22:02.125
Maybe.

22:02.289 --> 22:06.047
Sweetie, this conversation is starting
to make me a little uncomfortable.

22:07.655 --> 22:11.253
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but...

22:11.418 --> 22:16.019
I mean, there's so much history
between us, you know?

22:16.183 --> 22:18.541
I'm sorry too.

22:26.233 --> 22:29.866
- I love you.
- I love you too.

22:31.759 --> 22:34.674
Okay, that's it,
we are seeing other people.

22:53.861 --> 22:54.851
Gladys?

23:01.509 --> 23:05.221
For the third time this week.
Man, this does not get old.

23:06.514 --> 23:10.305
- You're mean!
- Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.073
