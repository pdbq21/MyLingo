WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:06.463
Check it out, this is unbelievable!

00:06.740 --> 00:09.834
Joey's been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.010
You trying to kill me?

00:18.752 --> 00:21.050
-I want to ask you something.
-What?

00:21.221 --> 00:24.679
Since I'm moving out,
and you're so beautiful...

00:25.792 --> 00:27.157
how about I move in with you?

00:27.427 --> 00:30.590
That would be great,
but what do we do about Denise?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.762
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.

00:33.934 --> 00:34.923
Your roommate?

00:35.135 --> 00:37.160
Yes, Denise. Denise!

00:38.939 --> 00:41.305
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.566
What about Denise? She cute?

00:45.512 --> 00:47.503
How can you have a roommate
that we don't know about?

00:47.681 --> 00:50.013
Because you never listen
to what I say.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.344
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!

00:54.688 --> 00:57.851
I'm gonna have an extra room
over at my place.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.220
-That's true.
-Move in with me.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.557
We can stay up late talking,
and watch movies.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.959
You know about
naked Thursdays, right?

01:08.001 --> 01:10.936
Yeah, yeah. I think
I'll find my own place.

01:11.338 --> 01:15.138
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.843
The One With Ross' Denial

01:57.250 --> 02:00.014
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

02:00.320 --> 02:01.378
Oh, that.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.749
She took it really well.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.722
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.194
Because you're in love with her.

02:09.396 --> 02:13.628
I am not in love with her. She was
upset about having to move out.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.734
If she knew we were still married,
she'd have been more upset.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.267
So I comforted her.
As a friend.

02:19.539 --> 02:20.972
You "comforted her"?

02:21.241 --> 02:22.902
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.875
A classic sign of love,
the hug.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.547
It's also a sign of friendship.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.683
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson."

02:32.452 --> 02:34.249
It was a hug. Okay?

02:34.421 --> 02:35.911
A simple hug.

02:36.089 --> 02:40.025
I was a friend being a friend
to a friend.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.320
Use the word "friend" more.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.393
Did you, or did you not,
smell her hair?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.827
Smell her hair?

02:48.502 --> 02:49.799
What if I did?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.962
Ninety percent of a woman's
pheromones come out of her head.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.937
That's why women are shorter.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.802
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.948
Come on, Ross,
you're a scientist.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.543
I was hugging her as a friend.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.117
It's not my fault
her hair got in my face.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.223
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all... all...

03:13.360 --> 03:14.884
coconutty.

03:16.830 --> 03:20.061
What? It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.895
Maybe it means
I have feelings for coconuts.

03:24.071 --> 03:28.235
Okay, but be careful. Rachel's not
in the same place you are.

03:28.608 --> 03:31.338
If the place you're
referring to is being in love...

03:31.645 --> 03:36.241
she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.142
I didn't understand that.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.248
Maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.329
-A guy just called for you.
-Who was it?

03:52.599 --> 03:55.727
I don't know. How about
"Thanks for taking the message"?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.395
When you move in...

04:00.640 --> 04:04.132
Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.274
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

04:07.514 --> 04:11.746
with a mahogany sleigh bed and
bedside tables with fresh flowers.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.317
And comment cards so people could
tell us how great their stay was.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.752
I really haven't
thought about it that much.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.391
Well, I like that idea... obviously.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.359
I was thinking maybe...
maybe it could be a game room.

04:28.769 --> 04:33.035
You can buy old arcade games, like
Space lnvaders and Asteroids...

04:33.273 --> 04:36.265
for $200. The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!

04:38.278 --> 04:39.302
No.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.539
You mean "No" as in:

04:43.950 --> 04:47.852
"What an interesting idea. Let's
discuss it before we reject it."

04:48.688 --> 04:50.212
I'm sorry.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.825
Interesting idea. But no.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.619
So that's it?

04:57.898 --> 05:01.561
I just don't think arcade games
go in a beautiful guest room...

05:01.835 --> 05:03.962
filled with antiques.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.695
Which is why Asteroids is
perfect. It's the oldest game.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.535
What's wrong with
a beautiful guest room?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.736
I'm not against it.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.746
Especially since everybody we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.247
Are you mocking me?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.978
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.389
Monica and l
had a stupid fight.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.033
You're still moving in together,
right? My ad came out today.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.562
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

05:43.577 --> 05:44.874
Nice.

05:45.045 --> 05:49.675
I figured it'd be more interesting
to have a female roommate.

05:49.916 --> 05:53.545
Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

05:53.753 --> 05:57.382
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

05:57.591 --> 06:00.059
than a girl who is 19?

06:02.395 --> 06:04.090
Not just a hatrack, my friend.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.097
Phoebe, I have to ask you..

06:08.301 --> 06:09.859
I'm swamped right now.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.434
You're just staring into space.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.437
I'm trying to move that pencil.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.476
-This one?
-lt worked!

06:21.615 --> 06:24.948
Phoebe, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.951
Anything I can afford comes with
a roommate who is a freak. Look.

06:29.990 --> 06:34.620
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

06:37.931 --> 06:41.367
That's probably some 12-year-old kid
trying to get girls to call.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.637
There's nothing. This city is full.

06:45.805 --> 06:46.897
Wait! Look at this!

06:47.140 --> 06:51.304
"Two bedroom, two bath. Must be
nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay."

06:52.913 --> 06:55.643
Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.444
-Rach, you still looking for a place?
-Yeah, why?

07:02.989 --> 07:07.119
This guy, Warren, from the museum
is going on a dig for two years.

07:07.827 --> 07:11.763
He's got this great place he needs
to sublet. You interested?

07:11.965 --> 07:15.423
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!

07:15.602 --> 07:19.003
Oh, wait. Is he the guy that asked you
for naked pictures of me?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.374
That doesn't matter,
he won't be there!

07:22.542 --> 07:24.806
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.

07:24.978 --> 07:28.641
Thank the volcano that erupted
thousands of years ago...

07:28.815 --> 07:32.808
killing, but perfectly preserving,
an entire civilization.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.986
Here's Warren's number.

07:37.557 --> 07:41.493
This is great. I'm gonna
call him right now! Thank you!

07:45.065 --> 07:46.726
Okay, you go call him.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.193
I saw it.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.001
What are you talking about?

07:53.206 --> 07:56.198
I'm talking about what you already
know but won't admit.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.843
You love her again. You re-love her.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.776
I do not re-love her.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.644
I can't believe
you won't just admit it.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.416
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

08:08.621 --> 08:12.557
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.824
The apartment
is already subletted.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.988
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.822
Live with me.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.156
-What?
-What?!

08:23.937 --> 08:25.336
What?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.537
Are you serious?

08:30.343 --> 08:33.437
I would love to live with you.
That's great. Thank you.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.045
I'm just glad I could help you out.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.447
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.716
Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

08:47.927 --> 08:52.023
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me. You're my hero.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.092
Hero? I don't know.
Well, all right.

08:57.771 --> 09:01.434
I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.708
Oh, please.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.446
You're gonna say things now,
aren't you?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.885
No. No, I won't.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.391
But I should tell you this.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.556
The same thing happened to my
roommate, Denise.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.992
She moved in with a guy
who was secretly married to her.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.995
He said he didn't love her, but he
really did. And it just blew up.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.930
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.598
Okay, that's a lie.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.111
-You don't have a roommate.
-Denise!

09:41.681 --> 09:44.673
No one ever listens to me!

09:52.492 --> 09:55.120
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.664
I only played those games because I
couldn't get girls. Now I can get..

10:01.534 --> 10:02.694
Now I have you.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.498
No, not that I think I have you...

10:06.840 --> 10:11.072
or think of you as property
in any sort of way. I see women....

10:11.277 --> 10:12.835
Stop it, Chandler.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.440
I'm sorry too.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.779
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh, yes.

10:20.653 --> 10:24.020
We can think of something
to do with the room together.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.056
Great idea. We can easily think of
a way for us both to enjoy the room.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.725
Totally.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.468
-We don't have to decide now.
-Good.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.139
Let's think about changes
we can make in the living room.

10:41.674 --> 10:42.663
Changes?

10:43.877 --> 10:47.404
We'll have to move some
furniture to make room for my chair.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.113
You're bringing the Barcalounger
over here?

10:52.752 --> 10:53.810
Is that a problem?

10:55.755 --> 10:58.883
It's just that they're a set
and should stay together.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.253
That's cool.
I'll bring them both over.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.920
You're taking them away
from their home.

11:06.065 --> 11:09.728
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
here is mine. Everything is yours.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.439
I'll get up in the morning, put on
your clothes and go off to work!

11:13.873 --> 11:18.333
Yeah, that's it. Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.675
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.108
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.010
In the game room!

11:25.218 --> 11:28.517
It is not my fault your
chairs are incredibly ugly.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.188
That's fine.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.688
I won't bring the chairs.
I won't bring anything!

11:32.892 --> 11:36.350
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance
over here at grandma's place!

11:38.064 --> 11:40.862
Everything on your application
looks really good.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.830
Just one last question.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.267
Will your friends be over here,
partying and hanging out?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.439
Don't worry.
I'm not a party girl.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.910
Don't just be blurting stuff out.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.048
I want you to really think
about your answers.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.282
Call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.948
Ignore him. He's just some
guy who wants the apartment.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.320
But he's not going to get it.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.293
You took down the shower curtain?

12:11.497 --> 12:13.260
That thing was a hazard!

12:14.601 --> 12:16.068
I'm very safety conscious.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.006
I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.271
Thanks.

12:30.483 --> 12:35.352
But listen, Monica and Chandler had a
big fight and they're not moving in.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.581
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

12:40.693 --> 12:44.322
No, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.998
Over a stupid room?

12:47.367 --> 12:51.804
I feel kind of bad for them, but now
I don't have to move in here!

12:52.138 --> 12:54.698
Oh, no. Yeah, that part's great.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.535
What's all this
about you guys fighting?

13:00.546 --> 13:03.174
Is this really over a room?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.781
That is so silly.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.280
-We can handle this.
-Apparently not.

13:10.490 --> 13:15.621
And I can't stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...

13:15.828 --> 13:19.025
be hurt by something
that is so silly.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.302
Enough of the silliness.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.062
Tell her to stop being silly.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.206
Two very good points.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.908
I've known you both a long time.

13:39.218 --> 13:42.745
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy...

13:43.056 --> 13:45.251
as you've been
since you got together.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.989
Do you really want
to throw that all away over a room?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.356
That is so silly.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.829
What's more important, love...

13:56.502 --> 13:58.163
or silliness?

13:59.605 --> 14:02.039
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.176
But we also have a soft spot
for the love.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.572
-Love is the best medicine.
-That's "laughter."

14:08.781 --> 14:10.078
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know.

14:15.288 --> 14:19.725
Now, Chandler, you want
to live with Monica, right?

14:20.927 --> 14:22.189
Yeah, I do.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.794
And, Mon, you want
to live with Chandler?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.087
Yes.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.460
A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York!

14:39.078 --> 14:42.377
So I understand you're
looking for a place?

14:43.983 --> 14:46.042
No, I'm staying put.

14:48.921 --> 14:52.220
I was going to offer you
my apartment.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.886
Why? Where you going?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.560
I don't know.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.131
You won't believe it.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.328
Monica and Chandler
are moving in again.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.473
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.178
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.617
Yeah. You know, about that....

15:20.586 --> 15:24.352
I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...

15:24.624 --> 15:27.252
but don't you think
it'll be weird?

15:29.495 --> 15:32.658
Why? Why would it....
Why would it be weird?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.128
Well, you know,
because of us.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.270
Because of our history.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.330
No!

15:40.807 --> 15:42.604
No, no!

15:42.809 --> 15:46.267
It would only be weird
if we were still in "that place."

15:46.546 --> 15:49.709
Are you still in that place?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.513
-No, not at all.
-Good. Me neither.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.454
So it's not a problem.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.783
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.450
Okay, but eventually
you and I will be dating.

16:05.364 --> 16:07.355
Really? We are?

16:07.633 --> 16:11.034
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
and you'll have a girlfriend.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.703
That'd be great.

16:16.542 --> 16:20.000
But if you think it'll be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.808
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door:

16:24.016 --> 16:26.746
"Come back later.
I'm getting lucky."

16:32.158 --> 16:34.592
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

16:37.029 --> 16:40.590
So are you sure about
this whole moving-in thing?

16:41.367 --> 16:45.497
It's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.107
That's very funny.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.107
He's being silly because
he knows we enjoy the silliness.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.683
No, I'm serious.
Think about it. You move in.

17:00.887 --> 17:05.756
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.

17:06.092 --> 17:09.027
It was just a stupid fight
about a room.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.024
There are no stupid fights!

17:12.431 --> 17:14.558
This isn't about the room.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.134
This is about
what the room represents.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.470
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you!

17:23.910 --> 17:26.435
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.475
Fine. It's your life!

17:29.916 --> 17:31.907
I just don't want
to see you break up.

17:32.118 --> 17:35.781
Which you will do
if you move in together.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.260
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.927
Don't do it!

17:48.301 --> 17:50.769
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.297
Ross didn't scare you?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.735
Scared me out of wanting
to live with him.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.739
-I gotta show you something.
-Okay.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.776
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!

18:06.852 --> 18:08.683
The Barcalounger can go here.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.652
You can see the TV, and it's still
walking distance to the kitchen.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.655
Oh, that's so sweet.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.957
I want to show you
something too.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.654
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

18:21.767 --> 18:25.931
I thought we could get one of those
signs and hang it over our bed.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.438
Because that's you and I together.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.203
"Merge!"

18:34.180 --> 18:35.977
-I love that!
-Really?

18:36.148 --> 18:37.137
"No!"

18:40.987 --> 18:43.455
I found you in my bed

18:44.357 --> 18:46.985
How'd you wind up there?

18:47.393 --> 18:50.021
You are a mystery

18:50.229 --> 18:52.720
Little black curly hair

18:56.235 --> 18:58.863
Little black, little black,
little black

18:59.071 --> 19:01.972
Little black curly hair

19:09.515 --> 19:12.484
If you want to receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows...

19:12.718 --> 19:15.687
please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.084
Where are the other guys?

19:23.429 --> 19:25.829
Well, Monica and Chandler
are occupied.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.696
-Fighting?
-The other thing.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.502
It's great they worked things out.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.502
There's no breaking them up,
is there?

19:35.675 --> 19:38.906
Can I borrow the key to your house
so I can go make a copy?

19:39.211 --> 19:40.735
-Here.
-Thank you.

19:41.681 --> 19:46.141
Are you sure? Once I make
a copy, there's no turning back.

19:46.819 --> 19:51.313
Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out
of here before I change my mind.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.926
You think moving in
with Rachel is a good idea?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.566
I've been back and forth.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.536
Well, maybe you should go back.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.239
She moves in,
and before you know it...

20:09.508 --> 20:11.669
you're right where you don't
want to be, back together.

20:11.911 --> 20:16.007
I don't think so. She's already
talking about dating other guys.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.275
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy...

20:20.553 --> 20:23.920
and you'll be telling her, "Oh,
that's okay. You'll find someone."

20:24.190 --> 20:26.522
And then, bam! She finds you!

20:30.096 --> 20:31.256
Maybe you're right.

20:31.530 --> 20:35.022
Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.393
Is that what you want?

20:37.103 --> 20:38.536
Is that what I want?

20:38.771 --> 20:39.931
Yes.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.600
Here she comes. I'm gonna
make your life much easier.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.838
The place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.208
Or not.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.677
Why don't you move in with me?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.818
Whoa, Joey!

20:57.590 --> 21:02.084
Look, I know I scared you with
that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

21:02.261 --> 21:06.197
but we don't have to do that.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.892
It would be easier
to move across the hall.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.329
Unless you're thinking about
naked Wednesdays.

21:16.475 --> 21:19.273
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!

21:25.951 --> 21:28.476
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.

21:28.654 --> 21:31.350
There's a lot of people
interested in the room.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.322
But I've narrowed it down,
and you're one of the finalists.

21:34.493 --> 21:37.053
-Great!
-Before I decide...

21:37.229 --> 21:40.255
I want to be sure
our personalities match.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.627
So I made up a little test.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.135
I'll say a word, and you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.967
-I can do that.
-Okay, here we go.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.608
-Pillow.
-Fight.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.676
Very good.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.636
"G."

21:55.848 --> 21:58.078
-String?
-Excellent!

22:02.488 --> 22:03.978
Doggy.

22:05.691 --> 22:08.387
-Kitten?
-Sorry!

22:10.563 --> 22:13.259
So close, though. Bye-bye!
