WEBVTT

00:02.337 --> 00:04.740
You said you'd marry Joey?

00:04.943 --> 00:08.313
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.

00:07.983 --> 00:09.680
I would have said yes to anybody.

00:09.853 --> 00:14.055
Like that time
when you and I got married.

00:14.863 --> 00:16.890
I'm not helping.

00:17.201 --> 00:21.666
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?

00:21.877 --> 00:25.874
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.

00:26.052 --> 00:28.181
But I am prepared to let that go.

00:29.325 --> 00:33.163
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again..

00:33.333 --> 00:36.704
you were engaged to my best friend?

00:36.907 --> 00:38.273
Well..

00:38.443 --> 00:40.106
Really?

00:40.314 --> 00:42.911
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.

00:43.086 --> 00:46.582
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my.. No!

00:49.098 --> 00:51.729
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

00:51.937 --> 00:53.839
Rachel said she'd marry you?

00:54.876 --> 00:57.712
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

01:51.957 --> 01:55.954
I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.

01:57.869 --> 02:03.541
No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"
But I can fix this one.

02:07.689 --> 02:09.591
See? Huh?

02:12.431 --> 02:13.900
So sexy.

02:15.103 --> 02:17.700
- Honey?
- Yeah?

02:19.278 --> 02:21.214
- Honey, why don't you lie down?
- It's okay.

02:21.415 --> 02:25.378
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.

02:29.465 --> 02:31.332
Am I producing them?

02:32.772 --> 02:35.334
- Why are you so tired?
- I couldn't sleep last night.

02:35.545 --> 02:38.540
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.

02:38.751 --> 02:41.085
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.

02:41.255 --> 02:45.161
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.531
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."

02:48.704 --> 02:51.004
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.

02:51.209 --> 02:54.842
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

02:57.354 --> 02:58.618
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:58.824 --> 03:00.224
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.793
Phoebe did the signs.

03:02.832 --> 03:06.533
You guys, thanks for doing this.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.302
Look at all that stuff people sent.

03:09.980 --> 03:13.043
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.

03:13.219 --> 03:17.661
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.

03:17.829 --> 03:23.136
What are people think..?
You guys, I love it.

03:24.576 --> 03:26.272
Hey, so where's Ross?

03:26.513 --> 03:28.779
He's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.

03:29.018 --> 03:31.615
- Is he still mad at us?
- Well, you more than me.

03:31.790 --> 03:34.785
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby.

03:35.030 --> 03:37.593
That's not fair. I can't do that.

03:38.202 --> 03:40.468
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.

03:40.708 --> 03:44.773
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.

03:44.983 --> 03:47.546
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.534
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.

03:57.709 --> 04:02.377
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.

04:07.996 --> 04:10.661
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.636
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you..

04:13.807 --> 04:17.804
I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.361
Walter.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.241
She's just so cute.

04:33.479 --> 04:37.978
I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.558
Phoebe.

04:40.761 --> 04:45.031
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.

04:45.971 --> 04:49.410
- Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
- Oh, great. The pacifiers?

04:49.579 --> 04:52.482
- It's in the cupboard.
- The burping cloths?

04:52.852 --> 04:55.653
- Linen closet.
- The diapers?

04:55.858 --> 04:57.292
In the hospital.

04:58.997 --> 05:03.905
- Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.
- No, I left the diapers at the hospital.

05:04.074 --> 05:06.841
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.

05:07.013 --> 05:08.208
All right, thanks.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.683
Could you stop at the coffeehouse
and get me a muffin?

05:10.888 --> 05:14.258
- Sure. What kind?
- Let me think.

05:14.428 --> 05:17.195
What do I want?

05:17.367 --> 05:19.930
What do I want?

05:20.140 --> 05:23.078
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like..

05:23.246 --> 05:28.245
say, I don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.

05:30.761 --> 05:32.663
- Blueberry.
- Blueberry it is.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.233
Thank you.

05:36.005 --> 05:37.975
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?

05:38.176 --> 05:40.476
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?

05:40.681 --> 05:45.315
I don't know. He got over the
"We were on a break" thing quickly.

05:45.925 --> 05:48.327
You know what,
I can't worry about it right now.

05:48.496 --> 05:51.901
Because I've got the cutie little baby.

05:53.005 --> 05:57.105
I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.774
Like, right now? I miss her.
I actually miss her.

06:00.688 --> 06:02.988
You know, that's her?

06:04.729 --> 06:07.667
I know. I know, but she's sleeping.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.775
It's not like when she's awake
and I can see her stretch and wiggle.

06:11.943 --> 06:13.708
Oh, my God, have you seen her yawn?

06:13.880 --> 06:16.784
- It's so cute.
- I know.

06:17.955 --> 06:19.788
When do you think
she's gonna wake up?

06:19.959 --> 06:22.429
She told me to ring her
if she's not up by 11.

06:22.598 --> 06:24.727
She has a job interview.

06:29.144 --> 06:31.547
Okay, but the clouds part
when she yawns.

06:34.288 --> 06:38.696
God, look at her sleeping.
I love her so much.

06:38.897 --> 06:40.890
- I think I'm gonna wake her up.
- Rach, no.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.006
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

06:44.207 --> 06:46.610
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.

06:48.149 --> 06:53.957
Come on, little girl.
Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

06:57.935 --> 07:01.966
Well, I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.

07:02.778 --> 07:05.909
I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep.

07:06.085 --> 07:07.952
Go back to sleep.

07:08.657 --> 07:12.688
- It breaks your heart, doesn't it?
- It really does.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.133
How long do you think
we have to stay?

07:18.008 --> 07:20.376
Okay, if everyone's onboard,
it's settled.

07:20.581 --> 07:23.108
Chandler?

07:28.897 --> 07:30.058
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

07:30.233 --> 07:32.704
Are you onboard?

07:33.372 --> 07:35.536
Yes.

07:35.744 --> 07:39.183
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.912
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

07:45.664 --> 07:49.364
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her..

07:49.605 --> 07:53.670
Try this one. "Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe."

07:55.851 --> 07:57.616
- All right, here's something.
- What?

07:57.788 --> 08:00.190
It says to try holding the baby
close to your body..

08:00.359 --> 08:03.297
and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

08:04.034 --> 08:07.473
Okay.

08:14.187 --> 08:15.485
It worked!

08:17.661 --> 08:20.656
No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.

08:22.337 --> 08:23.704
Mon, what am I gonna do?

08:23.874 --> 08:27.507
It's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.

08:28.683 --> 08:33.021
- She, Rach. Not it. She.
- Yeah. I'm not so sure.

08:34.194 --> 08:37.223
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
- Yeah, no kidding.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.204
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!

08:46.184 --> 08:50.318
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?

08:50.561 --> 08:52.588
- Diapers, huh?
- Yep.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.701
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

08:55.403 --> 08:59.104
- Yep. Can you believe it?
- Nope.

08:59.277 --> 09:02.512
I can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.

09:05.456 --> 09:08.793
You mean, like..

09:15.109 --> 09:16.772
Hey.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.686
I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.

09:21.889 --> 09:24.793
Actually, we don't.

09:25.129 --> 09:29.035
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

09:30.641 --> 09:33.772
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

09:33.980 --> 09:37.384
- I said I didn't technically.
- Okay.

09:37.821 --> 09:40.087
Let's put aside the fact
that you "accidentally"..

09:40.292 --> 09:44.859
picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

09:45.036 --> 09:46.938
Can I just stop you there
for a second?

09:47.173 --> 09:48.574
When people do this:

09:48.743 --> 09:51.213
I don't really know what that means.

09:56.893 --> 09:58.122
You were saying?

09:58.362 --> 10:02.063
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

10:02.236 --> 10:06.301
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

10:06.478 --> 10:10.544
I know. I should've.
"I'm sorry."

10:16.098 --> 10:17.897
Not using it right, Joe.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.365
"I'm sorry."

10:24.414 --> 10:25.781
- I'm gonna go.
- No, come on.

10:25.951 --> 10:28.114
- Ross, we have to get past this.
- Give me the bag.

10:28.288 --> 10:31.488
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now..

10:31.662 --> 10:34.657
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.932
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

10:38.108 --> 10:40.705
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.

10:41.983 --> 10:43.212
- I don't.
- A little bit.

10:43.418 --> 10:45.285
- No.
- Little bit.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.554
- No.
- A little bit more.

10:48.830 --> 10:51.426
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
- No, hit me. Hit me.

10:51.636 --> 10:53.697
- Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.
- Hit me.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.876
- No.
- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

11:08.268 --> 11:11.605
- You ducked!
- I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

11:11.843 --> 11:15.213
- Oh, my God! This really hurts!
- I couldn't help it.

11:15.449 --> 11:19.287
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.

11:21.428 --> 11:23.956
What is the matter with you?

11:24.167 --> 11:26.228
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?

11:26.438 --> 11:28.408
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

11:28.610 --> 11:33.074
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.

11:47.981 --> 11:50.953
- Try feeding her again.
- I already fed her.

11:51.154 --> 11:53.819
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

11:54.995 --> 11:57.227
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?

11:57.433 --> 11:59.666
That's just what she wants.

12:00.439 --> 12:02.204
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:02.544 --> 12:05.675
I told you you shouldn't have
let her watch Terms of Endearment.

12:06.418 --> 12:09.015
- Can I talk to you outside?
- Just stay here.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.593
I'm gonna check her diaper.
Phoebe, you want to come?

12:11.762 --> 12:14.598
I'm kind of part of this.

12:16.906 --> 12:19.240
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.

12:19.444 --> 12:21.915
I knew I should've married Chandler.

12:23.653 --> 12:26.249
- Okay, what's up?
- Okay.

12:26.559 --> 12:29.325
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?

12:29.497 --> 12:32.162
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write..

12:32.336 --> 12:36.641
and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

12:36.812 --> 12:38.941
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:39.117 --> 12:42.682
You know how people say
that Tulsa..

12:44.127 --> 12:46.290
is the Paris of Oklahoma?

12:48.836 --> 12:50.361
What? Who says that?

12:51.408 --> 12:54.107
People who have never been
to Paris?

12:54.815 --> 12:58.983
- Well, what's going on?
- We're moving to Tulsa.

13:01.729 --> 13:04.063
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

13:04.233 --> 13:07.034
Ms. McKenna,
she kind of works above my boss.

13:07.206 --> 13:10.269
- I think you actually met her.
- Don't care. Get back to Tulsa.

13:10.446 --> 13:14.045
She asked me to move to Tulsa
and be president of our office there.

13:14.220 --> 13:17.124
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.

13:17.661 --> 13:21.191
- Tulsa, Oklahoma?
- The Sooner State.

13:22.737 --> 13:24.536
Whatever that is.

13:24.908 --> 13:28.074
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical Oklahoma.

13:28.281 --> 13:31.117
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,"
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

13:31.321 --> 13:35.786
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?

13:38.569 --> 13:40.470
I don't think I can get out of this.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.974
- Oh, my God!
- But you don't know..

13:43.145 --> 13:45.981
it could be like Paris.
You can still take a cooking class..

13:46.151 --> 13:48.987
at Oral Roberts University.

13:49.691 --> 13:53.460
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?

13:53.666 --> 13:57.936
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.

13:59.778 --> 14:02.716
- I'll get out of it.
- Thank you.

14:03.151 --> 14:05.018
- What is wrong with Emma?
- She misunderstood.

14:05.189 --> 14:07.352
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

14:11.936 --> 14:14.567
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

14:14.741 --> 14:19.148
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

14:19.651 --> 14:24.388
- What?
- It's a funny story, actually.

14:25.095 --> 14:28.499
I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.

14:28.669 --> 14:32.199
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.

14:32.409 --> 14:33.571
You fell asleep?

14:33.779 --> 14:36.443
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.

14:36.619 --> 14:38.019
Isn't that funny?

14:39.891 --> 14:42.522
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

14:44.501 --> 14:45.867
See, here's the thing.

14:46.037 --> 14:49.498
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.

14:49.678 --> 14:53.550
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is ltaly.

14:53.719 --> 14:55.746
Please don't make me go there.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.962
- Chandler, I..
- I know that you're upset..

14:59.130 --> 15:02.797
but I just.. I would really
rather just stay here.

15:04.473 --> 15:06.375
Not here in your office..

15:06.545 --> 15:08.377
here at the company..

15:08.549 --> 15:11.680
where I'm rapidly feeling unwelcome.

15:12.489 --> 15:15.553
No, look, Carol.
Can I call you Carol?

15:17.634 --> 15:19.570
Why would I
when your name is Elaine?

15:25.215 --> 15:27.743
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.

15:29.825 --> 15:32.888
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?

15:33.098 --> 15:36.833
Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

15:39.477 --> 15:42.210
I'll call you from Tulsa.

15:46.224 --> 15:48.752
Hey. So how is it?

15:48.929 --> 15:52.869
- I broke my thumb.
- Your thumb?

15:55.375 --> 15:58.108
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?

15:58.281 --> 16:00.912
Make a fist.

16:01.622 --> 16:03.615
Maybe later.

16:03.793 --> 16:05.524
Ross, I feel terrible.

16:05.696 --> 16:10.330
You know what, you can go.
I just have to fill out some forms.

16:14.915 --> 16:16.714
You want me to help you with that?

16:16.952 --> 16:20.722
Why, does it look like I'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.295
Name?

16:27.674 --> 16:30.544
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?

16:30.713 --> 16:32.842
You know, like Rossell.

16:33.384 --> 16:37.256
Or Rosstrophor.

16:37.527 --> 16:40.054
Just Ross.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.761
It's pretty.

16:43.404 --> 16:46.741
- Okay, date of birth?
- You know my birthday.

16:46.912 --> 16:49.075
Sure.

16:49.416 --> 16:53.517
May.. tember?

16:53.893 --> 16:59.097
- October 18.
- Occupation? Dinosaurs.

17:00.640 --> 17:06.242
Actually, I'm a paleon..
Dinosaurs is fine.

17:06.585 --> 17:09.716
The drawing is not.

17:12.931 --> 17:16.233
All right, who do you want
as your emergency contact?

17:17.272 --> 17:20.575
- Rachel, I guess.
- Okay. Relationship?

17:20.746 --> 17:23.616
Boy, this could take a while.

17:26.825 --> 17:28.954
- Just put roommate.
- Come on.

17:29.129 --> 17:32.625
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together, right?

17:32.837 --> 17:34.807
I don't think that we are.

17:36.945 --> 17:39.108
But you two are supposed
to be together.

17:39.316 --> 17:42.517
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.

17:42.890 --> 17:45.190
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.

17:45.362 --> 17:48.232
She'd just had the baby. She was
freaked out about doing it alone.

17:48.401 --> 17:52.466
- She would have said yes to anybody.
- Yeah, that's what she said.

17:52.644 --> 17:56.014
- So?
- So I don't want to be just anybody.

17:59.223 --> 18:00.749
- Wow.
- You know what?

18:00.926 --> 18:04.023
It's better this way anyway.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.239
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.

18:08.408 --> 18:14.080
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.

18:14.286 --> 18:16.347
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:16.725 --> 18:20.459
- And you're okay with that?
- Yes. That's what we always planned.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.160
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.

18:23.371 --> 18:26.776
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?

18:29.316 --> 18:31.081
I'm fine.

18:31.955 --> 18:33.686
Hey, for what it's worth..

18:33.892 --> 18:38.458
with Rachel, I don't think
you'll ever be just "anybody."

18:38.669 --> 18:41.971
Hey, there you go.

18:43.144 --> 18:45.171
"Thanks."

18:50.358 --> 18:53.820
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?

18:53.999 --> 18:56.435
About a week and a half.

18:56.671 --> 19:01.237
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so I'm just gonna go.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.751
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?

19:05.956 --> 19:08.153
All right.

19:09.029 --> 19:12.662
- Try holding her a different way.
- Look, I'm doing the best I can.

19:12.837 --> 19:16.003
- Anyone else is welcome to try.
- All right, I'll try. Fine.

19:16.177 --> 19:18.512
- Yes. Okay. Okay.
- Here you go.

19:18.682 --> 19:21.380
Hey. Oh, gosh.

19:21.555 --> 19:24.721
Nothing works with this child!

19:24.894 --> 19:28.800
God, what am I gonna do, you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.701
- I'm the worst mother ever.
- No, you're just new at this.

19:31.875 --> 19:35.109
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.

19:35.281 --> 19:37.775
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.

19:38.020 --> 19:42.724
Yeah, I don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!

19:42.930 --> 19:46.563
- God, just please take her.
- Okay, I'll take her. Come on.

19:46.738 --> 19:49.676
Oh, boy,
I have to go to the bathroom.

19:49.844 --> 19:52.941
I have to go scream into a pillow.

19:56.558 --> 20:00.658
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

20:00.833 --> 20:05.673
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

20:05.843 --> 20:09.179
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

20:10.886 --> 20:13.585
Have I gone deaf?

20:15.529 --> 20:21.495
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

20:21.708 --> 20:24.338
You must be a fireball in bed!

20:26.050 --> 20:31.858
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.

20:32.028 --> 20:34.430
I have actual magical powers.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.897
I can hear traffic and birds.

20:39.076 --> 20:41.707
I can hear the voices in my head again.

20:43.719 --> 20:45.882
I'm kidding.

20:48.729 --> 20:52.567
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!

20:52.770 --> 20:56.904
Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.

20:57.412 --> 21:02.047
- You are the official baby-crier stopper.
- Yes, I am.

21:02.255 --> 21:05.751
- You're never leaving the apartment.
- Say what?

21:05.996 --> 21:10.300
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.

21:10.506 --> 21:14.240
- No, no, no.
- Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

21:14.413 --> 21:18.514
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later.

21:18.722 --> 21:22.286
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.945
Okay, so listen,
I'm gonna go lay down.

21:34.854 --> 21:35.879
What?

21:36.123 --> 21:39.027
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.

21:39.196 --> 21:40.631
So..

21:42.503 --> 21:43.869
Thank you.

21:47.278 --> 21:49.145
Hey.

21:49.316 --> 21:53.519
- We just got her to go to sleep.
- So there can't be any yelling?

21:55.596 --> 21:57.691
No.

22:00.404 --> 22:03.571
- We're moving to Tulsa.
- What?

22:06.684 --> 22:09.850
I can't.. I can't hear.

22:15.368 --> 22:19.399
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

22:21.413 --> 22:24.909
- What happened to you?
- I had a little thing with Joey.

22:25.121 --> 22:27.387
If you think this is bad,
you should see him.

22:28.895 --> 22:31.229
No, Ross, this is not good.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.842
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.

22:38.949 --> 22:42.616
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.

22:43.090 --> 22:48.158
Okay? I never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?

22:50.037 --> 22:51.164
Okay.

22:52.977 --> 22:55.642
You know what I really, really want?

22:57.786 --> 23:00.256
What, Rach?

23:00.959 --> 23:03.486
I wanna sleep.

23:04.533 --> 23:09.908
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.

23:10.144 --> 23:14.312
I mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.

23:14.486 --> 23:17.755
- Right.
- I mean, because I got news for you.

23:17.926 --> 23:21.092
Emma: not easy.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.736
Well, that's what I'm here for.

23:29.115 --> 23:32.178
- You want me to get that?
- No, that's really okay.

23:32.355 --> 23:36.922
- Monica?
- Got it, got it, got it, got it.

23:46.383 --> 23:50.050
I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fault.

23:50.224 --> 23:52.821
- It's a natural instinct.
- What are you talking about?

23:53.063 --> 23:55.933
Okay, what would you do if I did this?
