WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:04.162
All right, Phoebe?

00:04.371 --> 00:09.001
If I were omnipotent for a day, <br/>I would want world peace...

00:09.209 --> 00:12.144
...no hunger, good things <br/>for the rain forest.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.510
And bigger boobs.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.814
Well, see, you took mine.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.744
What about you?

00:20.954 --> 00:25.891
If I were omnipotent for a day, <br/>I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

00:26.092 --> 00:31.223
There's always one guy. "lf I had a <br/>wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "

00:32.966 --> 00:34.433
Hey, Joey.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.467
What would you do <br/>if you were omnipotent?

00:37.670 --> 00:39.763
Probably kill myself.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.134
Excuse me?

00:42.342 --> 00:46.039
If little Joey's dead, <br/>then I got no reason to live.

00:48.014 --> 00:51.472
Joey, omnipotent.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.953
You are?

00:54.287 --> 01:00.089
Ross, l' m sorry. I had no idea. I <br/>thought it was a theoretical question.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.291
The One With the George Stephanopoulos

01:50.143 --> 01:52.043
How does she do that?

01:52.245 --> 01:54.679
I can't sleep in a public place.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.543
Libraries, airplanes, <br/>movie theaters....

01:57.750 --> 01:59.741
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.912
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us <br/>to the Grand Canyon.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.519
Mom and Dad took us <br/>to the Grand Canyon?

02:08.661 --> 02:12.028
Would you look at her? <br/>She is so peaceful.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.527
Yeah.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.167
What? What? What?

02:16.369 --> 02:20.499
-Hi. <br/>-It's okay. You just nodded off again.

02:20.707 --> 02:21.799
What's going on?

02:22.008 --> 02:26.911
I got no sleep last night. My <br/>grandmother has a new boyfriend...

02:27.780 --> 02:32.649
...and they' re both kind of insecure <br/>in bed, so And deaf.

02:34.521 --> 02:38.184
They reassure each other <br/>that they' re having a good time.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.827
You have no idea how loud they are.

02:42.729 --> 02:46.028
-You can stay with Rachel and me. <br/>-Thanks.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.395
95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.594
Less than 1 00 steps <br/>from our place to here.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.899
You got way too much free time, man.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.703
There's the birthday boy.

02:58.912 --> 03:03.508
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins <br/>tonight and we're taking you.

03:03.716 --> 03:06.844
-Happy birthday, pal! <br/>-We love you, man.

03:08.054 --> 03:11.285
It's funny. My birthday <br/>was seven months ago.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.119
-So? <br/>-So you had an extra ticket...

03:14.327 --> 03:17.626
...and couldn't decide <br/>who got to bring a date?

03:17.830 --> 03:21.493
Well, aren't we <br/>Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

03:21.768 --> 03:25.670
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th? <br/>October 20th?

03:25.872 --> 03:29.968
-I hoped you wouldn't remember. <br/>-What's wrong with the 20th?

03:30.176 --> 03:34.738
Eleven days before Halloween. <br/>All the good costumes are gone?

03:34.948 --> 03:38.611
T oday's the day Carol and I first...

03:38.818 --> 03:41.048
...consummated our...

03:41.254 --> 03:43.814
... physical relationship.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.422
Sex.

03:49.028 --> 03:53.692
-You told your sister that? <br/>-Believe me, I told everyone.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.163
I better pass on the game.

03:56.369 --> 04:01.534
I'm just gonna go home and think about <br/>my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.343
The hell with hockey! <br/>Let's all do that!

04:06.946 --> 04:10.746
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice! <br/>Guys' night out!

04:10.950 --> 04:13.418
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

04:13.620 --> 04:16.180
-What are you doing? <br/>-I have no idea.

04:16.456 --> 04:20.756
-Come on, Ross. <br/>-Maybe it will take my mind off it.

04:20.960 --> 04:24.123
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger? <br/>-You got it.

04:24.497 --> 04:27.227
Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

04:27.433 --> 04:32.029
Look at the window! <br/>There's my name! Hi, me!

04:32.739 --> 04:35.207
I remember when <br/>I got my first paycheck.

04:35.408 --> 04:39.572
There was a cave-in in a mine, <br/>and eight people were killed.

04:40.847 --> 04:45.682
-You worked in a mine? <br/>-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

04:48.588 --> 04:54.049
Isn't this exciting? I earned this. <br/>I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.455
And it was totally...

04:56.663 --> 04:58.858
... not worth it.

04:59.065 --> 05:03.024
What's FlCA? <br/>Why's he getting all my money?

05:03.803 --> 05:07.261
I mean, what? <br/>Chandler, look at that.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.038
This is not that bad.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.041
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.908
You can totally, <br/>totally live on this.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.447
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:18.651 --> 05:22.610
-By the way, great service today. <br/>-Yeah.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.652
-Hockey! <br/>-Hockey!

05:39.405 --> 05:41.771
-Hockey! <br/>-Hockey.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.501
Rachel?

05:46.412 --> 05:48.846
Oh, my God!

05:53.653 --> 05:57.851
I swear I've seen birds <br/>do this on Wild Kingdom.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.718
What are you doing here?

05:59.926 --> 06:05.728
We were in the city shopping, and your <br/>mom said you work here, and it's true!

06:07.700 --> 06:12.160
Look at you in the apron. <br/>You look like you're in a play.

06:14.073 --> 06:17.531
God, look at you! You're so big! <br/>I can't believe it!

06:17.744 --> 06:21.373
I know, I know! I'm a duplex.

06:21.647 --> 06:27.313
IKiki, you look phenomenal. I mean, <br/>you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.385
And you should...

06:29.856 --> 06:33.815
... really, really It's time to stop, <br/>you look perfect.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.550
What's going on?

06:35.762 --> 06:39.823
Well, guess who my dad's <br/>making partner in his firm?

06:42.835 --> 06:45.827
And while we're on <br/>the subject of news....

06:48.941 --> 06:51.603
Look, look! I have elbows!

06:56.783 --> 06:59.274
Passes it up to Leetch.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.750
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

07:03.990 --> 07:08.393
We'll take a time-out while Messier <br/>looks at some women's shoes.

07:08.594 --> 07:13.531
Carol was wearing boots just like <br/>those the night that we first....

07:13.733 --> 07:16.861
You know? In fact, she....

07:17.069 --> 07:19.230
She never took them off.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.704
It's because we Sorry, sorry.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.476
I can't believe

07:27.447 --> 07:29.506
-What? <br/>-Peach pit.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.041
Yes, bunny?

07:32.518 --> 07:36.045
Peach pit. That night, we had

07:36.255 --> 07:40.282
-Peaches? <br/>-Actually, nectarines but....

07:40.493 --> 07:41.983
Could've been a peach.

07:42.195 --> 07:47.827
Then we Then we got dressed <br/>and I walked her to...

07:48.034 --> 07:51.868
...the bus stop. I' m fine.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.866
Hey, that woman's got <br/>an ass like Carol's.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.940
What? I thought we were <br/>trying to find stuff.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.512
Come on, you guys. <br/>T ell me all the dirt.

08:06.719 --> 08:11.782
Well, the biggest news is still you <br/>dumping Barry at the altar.

08:12.892 --> 08:16.658
-Let's talk reality for a second. <br/>-Okay.

08:16.863 --> 08:21.061
-When are you coming home? <br/>-What? Guys, l' m not.

08:21.267 --> 08:24.964
-Come on. This is us. <br/>-l' m not.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.232
This is what l' m doing now. <br/>I've got this job.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.570
I even do my own laundry.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.983
-This is what l' m doing now. <br/>-Waitressing?

08:40.186 --> 08:46.147
I' m not just waitressing. <br/>I mean, l' m....

08:46.359 --> 08:52.264
I write the specials <br/>on the specials board.

08:52.465 --> 08:56.561
And I take the dead flowers <br/>out of the vase.

08:56.769 --> 09:01.638
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the <br/>chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

09:01.841 --> 09:05.971
Well, your mom didn't tell us <br/>about the blobbies.

09:16.022 --> 09:19.048
Hey, Rach. <br/>How was it with your friends?

09:22.295 --> 09:25.594
Okay, how would you like <br/>some Tiki Death punch?

09:25.798 --> 09:28.289
-What's that? <br/>-Well, it's rum and

09:28.501 --> 09:30.264
Okay.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.735
Since Phoebe's staying, <br/>we'll have a slumber party.

09:35.942 --> 09:40.208
We got trashy magazines. <br/>We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

09:40.980 --> 09:46.612
And I brought Operation. But I lost <br/>the tweezers so we can't operate.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.854
But we can prep the guy.

09:51.591 --> 09:56.290
-Rach, it's the Visa card people. <br/>-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

09:56.495 --> 10:00.124
Could you please tell me <br/>what this is in reference to?

10:00.900 --> 10:04.427
There's been unusual <br/>activity on your account.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.969
I haven't used my card in weeks.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.801
That is the unusual activity.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.377
They wanna see if you're okay.

10:13.579 --> 10:17.606
They wanna know if I'm okay? <br/>Okay, let's see.

10:17.817 --> 10:21.651
Well, let's see. <br/>The FlCA guys took all my money.

10:21.854 --> 10:25.449
Everyone is getting married <br/>or pregnant or promoted.

10:25.658 --> 10:29.754
And I'm getting coffee. <br/>And it's not even for me!

10:29.962 --> 10:34.331
If that sounds like I'm okay, <br/>then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

10:36.102 --> 10:41.438
Rachel has left the building. <br/>Can you call back?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.303
All right! Come on!

10:44.744 --> 10:47.372
Let's play Twister!

10:55.521 --> 11:00.424
-Sorry. <br/>-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

11:00.626 --> 11:04.426
There was ice that night with Carol? <br/>Plastic seats?

11:04.630 --> 11:07.622
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

11:08.434 --> 11:12.063
No, I was just saying <br/>we're not sitting together.

11:12.271 --> 11:16.071
But now that you mention it, <br/>there was ice that night.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.443
It was the first frost.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.977
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.776
You're doing <br/>this amazing independent thing.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.283
Monica, what is so amazing?

11:28.487 --> 11:32.685
I gave up, like, everything. <br/>And for what?

11:32.892 --> 11:36.419
-You are just like Jack. <br/>-Jack from downstairs?

11:37.096 --> 11:40.088
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.158
Ah, the other Jack.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.805
Right. He gave up something <br/>but then he got those magic beans.

11:47.006 --> 11:51.375
And then he woke up <br/>and there was this big plant...

11:51.577 --> 11:55.069
...outside of his window, <br/>full of possibilities.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.717
He lived in a village, <br/>and you live in the Village.

11:58.918 --> 12:05.323
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow. <br/>I gave up an orthodontist.

12:05.524 --> 12:10.689
-Okay, I know I didn't love him.... <br/>-Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.257
But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.402
Everything was figured out. <br/>Now it's like....

12:17.603 --> 12:19.662
-Floopy? <br/>-Yeah.

12:20.973 --> 12:24.170
We don't know where we' re going.

12:24.376 --> 12:29.780
It's all gonna come together <br/>and it's just gonna be un-floopy.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.314
Yeah, like that's a word.

12:34.820 --> 12:39.348
Okay. But Monica, what if <br/>it doesn't come together?

12:40.392 --> 12:42.155
Pheebs?

12:43.062 --> 12:46.964
Well, because you just <br/>I don't like this question.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.297
See, you guys? <br/>What if we don't get magic beans?

12:51.504 --> 12:56.203
I mean, what if all <br/>we've got are beans?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.945
Get him! Get him! Get him!

13:03.149 --> 13:06.084
Yes! You're not laughing now, <br/>are you, pal?

13:06.285 --> 13:10.244
All you needed were guys <br/>hitting each other with sticks.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.822
Pass it! Pass it!

13:13.025 --> 13:17.587
-He's open! He's open! <br/>-Shoot it! Shoot it!

13:22.668 --> 13:25.296
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.842
Excuse me?

13:38.050 --> 13:42.316
It says to call if you're not <br/>satisfied with this candy bar.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.649
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.519
Well, the label <br/>promises nutty goodness.

13:51.263 --> 13:56.223
It's an emergency. But you know that, <br/>or we'd be in the predicament room.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.635
Hold on. Fill these out. <br/>Sit over there!

14:01.907 --> 14:06.003
I don't want to make any trouble <br/>but I'm in a lot of pain.

14:06.212 --> 14:10.512
-My face is dented. <br/>-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

14:10.716 --> 14:15.813
-How long do you think it will be? <br/>-Any minute now.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.016
Hey, this

14:31.971 --> 14:36.305
I' m so sorry, you guys. <br/>I didn't mean to bring you down.

14:36.508 --> 14:41.912
No, you were right. <br/>I don't have a plan.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.382
-Pizza guy. <br/>-Food!

14:47.586 --> 14:49.679
-Phoebe? <br/>-What?

14:49.889 --> 14:54.121
-Do you have a plan? <br/>-I don't even have a " pla. "

14:56.562 --> 14:59.156
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

14:59.365 --> 15:03.165
No, no, no. <br/>That's not what we ordered!

15:03.369 --> 15:07.305
We ordered a fat-free crust <br/>with extra cheese!

15:10.042 --> 15:14.502
Wait. You' re not G. Stephanopoulos? <br/>Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

15:14.713 --> 15:18.911
Wait! Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

15:19.118 --> 15:24.181
Yeah, this one goes across the street. <br/>I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

15:24.390 --> 15:28.121
When you do that, <br/>you're only hitting yourself.

15:30.195 --> 15:36.065
Was this a small Mediterranean guy <br/>with curiously intelligent good looks?

15:36.268 --> 15:40.295
-That sounds right. <br/>-Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

15:40.506 --> 15:44.340
-And a power tie? <br/>-No, pretty much just a towel.

15:44.543 --> 15:48.639
-Oh, God! <br/>-You guys want me to take this back?

15:48.847 --> 15:53.614
What, are you nuts? We've got <br/>George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

15:57.222 --> 16:01.818
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?

16:03.562 --> 16:06.122
That's Big Bird's friend.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.300
-I see pizza! <br/>-I want to see. Let me see.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.494
Hello! Who are we spying on?

16:13.706 --> 16:16.869
White House adviser, <br/>Clinton's campaign guy.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.477
The one with the great hair, <br/>sexy smile, cute butt.

16:20.679 --> 16:24.740
Oh, him! The little guy. <br/>Oh, I love him!

16:24.950 --> 16:30.411
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman. <br/>-T ell me it's his mother.

16:30.622 --> 16:33.284
-Definitely not his mother. <br/>-Oh, no!

16:33.492 --> 16:38.156
Wait, she's walking across the floor. <br/>She's walking, she's walking....

16:38.364 --> 16:42.095
She's going for the pizza <br/>That's not for you, bitch!

16:57.082 --> 17:02.076
We've been here for over an hour, <br/>and people less sick have gone in.

17:02.287 --> 17:05.916
That guy with the toe thing, <br/>who's he sleeping with?

17:08.660 --> 17:11.595
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

17:11.797 --> 17:14.595
I know we both said some things...

17:15.534 --> 17:20.267
...we didn't mean but that doesn't <br/>mean we still don't love each other.

17:20.472 --> 17:24.067
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.604
-Come on, push me. <br/>-No.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.409
-Push me. <br/>-We' re gonna get in trouble.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.018
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

17:35.220 --> 17:40.590
All right. I' m gonna push you, okay? <br/>How about I push you like this?

17:42.394 --> 17:48.196
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair <br/>the rest of your life, pally-wally....

17:50.035 --> 17:55.530
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

17:57.010 --> 17:59.001
-Lights still out? <br/>-Yeah.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.010
Well, maybe they' re napping.

18:02.215 --> 18:06.777
-Please. They' re having sex. <br/>-Shut up!

18:09.622 --> 18:14.252
So, what do you think George is like?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.793
-I think he's shy. <br/>-Yeah.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.863
Yeah. I think you have <br/>to draw him out.

18:20.066 --> 18:25.094
And then when you do, <br/>he's a preppy animal.

18:26.039 --> 18:29.031
-What do you think of the guys? <br/>-Our guys?

18:29.242 --> 18:32.643
-Yeah, our guys. <br/>-I feel funny talking about that.

18:32.846 --> 18:36.111
-Oh, come on. <br/>-Okay. Well....

18:36.316 --> 18:39.046
I think Joey's like <br/>a little kiddie ride.

18:39.252 --> 18:43.552
You just have to put the quarter in <br/>and it just goes.

18:44.858 --> 18:48.988
He might surprise you. One time, <br/>he helped me put on my coat...

18:49.195 --> 18:51.993
...and he was really tender.

18:52.198 --> 18:56.726
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.836
Yes!

18:59.906 --> 19:04.570
Chandler's one of those repressed guys <br/>who you'd have to seduce.

19:04.777 --> 19:09.680
I think it's an act. Chandler is <br/>more sophisticated than he seems.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.615
-You know who's kind of sexy? <br/>-Don't.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.782
-Ross. <br/>-No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.657
I know exactly what you mean. <br/>He can be really smooth.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.605
Can't you just picture him in bed?

19:38.812 --> 19:41.076
I really don't want to.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.380
Come on, laugh. Laugh.

19:44.818 --> 19:49.881
I remember the moonlight coming in the <br/>window, and her face had the most...

19:50.090 --> 19:51.751
...incredible glow.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.917
The moon, the glow, <br/>the magical feeling. You did this.

19:56.129 --> 19:59.462
Could I get some painkillers <br/>over here, please?

19:59.933 --> 20:03.699
He's right. Enough. <br/>What's the big deal about today?

20:03.904 --> 20:06.702
So you slept with her <br/>for the first time.

20:06.907 --> 20:10.001
You slept with her <br/>for seven years after that.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.078
It's a little more complicated

20:13.280 --> 20:18.047
What is it, that she left you <br/>for another woman that likes women?

20:18.251 --> 20:23.814
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th <br/>floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.387
Then, what?

20:28.495 --> 20:31.191
My first time with Carol was...

20:31.398 --> 20:33.992
...was my....

20:34.801 --> 20:36.029
What?

20:38.538 --> 20:43.532
It was my first time.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.978
With Carol?

20:50.684 --> 20:51.981
Oh.

20:52.786 --> 20:56.347
So, in your whole life, <br/>you've only been with one?

20:57.858 --> 21:01.817
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.720
There's a bunch of stuff <br/>we could've done tonight.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.528
Okay, I got one.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.064
Do you remember <br/>that vegetarian pate...

21:13.273 --> 21:16.299
...that I made that you loved so much?

21:17.177 --> 21:21.113
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!

21:24.017 --> 21:28.215
Now I don't feel so bad <br/>about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

21:28.421 --> 21:32.380
-What? You slept with Jason? <br/>-You had already broken up.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.060
-How long? <br/>-Just a couple hours.

21:35.262 --> 21:39.961
-Oh, that's nice! <br/>-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

21:41.935 --> 21:46.872
Anyway, the valentine T om left in <br/>your locker was really from me!

21:47.641 --> 21:49.472
Excuse me?

21:49.676 --> 21:54.136
Hello! Like he was really <br/>gonna send you one.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.647
She was a big girl!

21:59.452 --> 22:05.516
Really? Well, at least big girls don't <br/>pee in their pants in seventh grade!

22:05.859 --> 22:08.623
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

22:08.829 --> 22:11.389
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

22:11.598 --> 22:14.931
-Where? <br/>-Where we've been looking all night.

22:15.268 --> 22:18.362
-He's so cute. <br/>-George, baby, drop the towel.

22:18.572 --> 22:22.941
-Come on, drop the towel. <br/>-Drop it. Will you please drop it?

22:23.210 --> 22:25.303
Wow!

22:28.114 --> 22:33.245
Man, can you believe <br/>he's only had sex with one woman?

22:33.920 --> 22:38.050
I think it's great. <br/>You know, it's sweet.

22:38.258 --> 22:40.317
It's romantic.

22:40.994 --> 22:42.188
Really?

22:42.395 --> 22:45.626
You kidding? The guy's a freak. <br/>I judge him.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.732
-Hey, man! <br/>-Hey, buddy!

22:51.538 --> 22:55.599
Oh, that's attractive.

22:56.776 --> 23:00.371
I thought you were great <br/>in Silence of the Lambs.

23:02.215 --> 23:05.810
Admit it, all things considered, <br/>you had fun tonight.

23:06.019 --> 23:09.614
Fun? Where was the fun? <br/>T ell me which part was fun.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.222
Where's my puck?

23:11.424 --> 23:14.393
-The kid has it. <br/>-The kid

23:15.362 --> 23:18.126
Excuse me, that's my puck.

23:18.331 --> 23:22.768
I found it. <br/>Finders keepers, losers weepers.

23:25.305 --> 23:27.330
You gotta do it, man.

23:28.275 --> 23:31.244
I' m rubber, you' re glue. <br/>Whatever you

23:31.444 --> 23:33.241
I can't do it.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.209
-Listen, give me back my puck. <br/>-No.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.043
-Yes, how about? <br/>-No.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.048
-Give me my puck. <br/>-No.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.187
No roughhousing in my ER!

23:42.389 --> 23:44.880
Give me my puck!

23:49.396 --> 23:52.194
Now that was fun.

23:57.604 --> 24:02.041
Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

24:02.242 --> 24:06.076
We could've played Monopoly, but no!

24:11.918 --> 24:13.681
Thanks.

24:19.292 --> 24:23.695
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

24:30.603 --> 24:34.630
Ross, switch with me <br/>and Phoebe could be number two.

24:36.276 --> 24:41.043
Nothing. It's a Twister thing. <br/>The rules are on the back of the box.

24:43.717 --> 24:45.412
Hello?

24:45.618 --> 24:47.518
It's the Visa card people.

24:47.721 --> 24:51.714
-Okay. Will you take my place? <br/>-All right. This is Rachel.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.620
No!

24:55.729 --> 25:01.133
Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know. <br/>I haven't been using it much.

25:01.334 --> 25:04.599
Oh, well, thanks. <br/>But l' m okay, really.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.170
-To the green. <br/>-Oh, no.

25:07.374 --> 25:10.207
I've got magic beans.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.974
No, no, never mind.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.910
T o the left! T o the left!

25:17.117 --> 25:20.280
I' m fine.
