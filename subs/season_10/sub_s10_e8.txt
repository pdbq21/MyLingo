WEBVTT

00:02.249 --> 00:03.319
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:03.490 --> 00:05.244
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:05.452 --> 00:06.967
We need to talk about something.

00:07.134 --> 00:10.174
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.

00:10.377 --> 00:11.812
- What?
- Are you kidding?

00:11.979 --> 00:14.621
Well, it's just with work
and the stress of adoption...

00:14.782 --> 00:16.615
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.

00:16.784 --> 00:21.100
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.

00:21.268 --> 00:24.468
That doesn't sound like you.

00:24.632 --> 00:26.545
That's Monica talking.

00:27.595 --> 00:33.197
- No, we made this decision together.
- She's putting words in your mouth.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.840
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.

00:37.925 --> 00:41.284
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

00:41.488 --> 00:45.485
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?

00:46.854 --> 00:49.974
Well, personally, I think it's great
you're giving yourself a break.

00:50.177 --> 00:52.694
- Thank you, Pheebs.
- Sure. It's just as well.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.533
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.

00:56.824 --> 01:00.787
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am I? Really? Am I?

01:00.948 --> 01:04.307
Well, why don't you cook
Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.

01:05.352 --> 01:08.871
Well, think about it. You'd be trying
to top what you did last year.

01:09.036 --> 01:12.111
You'd be in competition with yourself.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.154
That's my favorite kind.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.795
Okay, we are doing this.

01:17.965 --> 01:20.083
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.

01:20.247 --> 01:23.846
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.

01:25.573 --> 01:29.012
We are supposed to make
these decisions together.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.852
Did you not watch
the Dr. Phil I taped for you?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.899
The One With The Late Thanksgiving

02:24.832 --> 02:26.631
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

02:27.274 --> 02:29.392
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.672
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.

02:33.841 --> 02:36.642
- Could you pick them up for me?
- You're not making the pies?

02:36.844 --> 02:38.164
I don't make chocolate pies.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.888
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.

02:41.048 --> 02:43.565
I ate so many that the
thought of them makes me sick.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.364
Did you at least win the contest?

02:45.573 --> 02:48.534
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.

02:49.577 --> 02:52.013
- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
- Can't wait.

02:52.179 --> 02:57.019
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.

02:58.506 --> 02:59.542
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.

02:59.707 --> 03:01.141
What's Emma doing today?

03:01.308 --> 03:04.861
Well, let's see, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...

03:05.032 --> 03:08.665
...and then she has to make
a very big poop.

03:09.717 --> 03:13.349
- Why?
- I want to enter her in a baby pageant.

03:13.561 --> 03:17.193
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.599
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.204
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.

03:23.931 --> 03:27.006
- Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
- Oh, okay.

03:27.174 --> 03:31.296
No. Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...

03:31.458 --> 03:34.659
...I mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...

03:34.862 --> 03:38.575
- And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.178
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.986
He still believes that what's
on the inside is important.

03:45.152 --> 03:48.944
Okay. And Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.

03:49.156 --> 03:51.753
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?

03:51.959 --> 03:52.949
Well, I was thinking...

03:53.160 --> 03:56.235
Take the clothes
off Joey's Cabbage Patch kid!

04:04.972 --> 04:06.692
Did someone drop the baton again?

04:06.894 --> 04:10.173
Why come all the way
from kansas to do that?

04:12.860 --> 04:15.935
I don't get older, I just get better.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.017
You know what just occurred to me?

04:18.185 --> 04:20.702
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.

04:20.868 --> 04:23.065
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.

04:23.270 --> 04:25.628
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.269
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.428
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

04:30.598 --> 04:34.720
Next year, it's gonna be
you, me and little Hemingway Bing.

04:36.283 --> 04:39.198
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.

04:44.892 --> 04:46.372
The Firm?

04:47.775 --> 04:51.134
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.

04:51.298 --> 04:55.261
You know, you always cook this meal
all by yourself. Let me help this year.

04:55.422 --> 04:57.016
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.

04:57.224 --> 05:00.698
But you don't have to do everything
Dr. Phil tells you to do.

05:00.868 --> 05:06.072
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.

05:06.313 --> 05:08.671
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.757
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.954
Tell me more.

05:14.161 --> 05:18.603
I'm gonna go check on something across
the hall. You start by washing these.

05:20.648 --> 05:22.766
Not with soap!

05:25.613 --> 05:29.895
You obviously haven't tasted
my Palmolive potatoes.

05:31.258 --> 05:34.811
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

05:35.022 --> 05:37.664
Dude, I wanted him to guess.

05:37.865 --> 05:40.301
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.183
- Guess where they are.
- Center ice.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.144
Did I do something to you?

05:48.596 --> 05:50.155
- The game's at 1.
- So?

05:50.317 --> 05:54.234
- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
- So we'll leave before it's over.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.912
But it could take us
a long time to get back home.

05:57.084 --> 06:01.286
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
have to page us to go pick him up.

06:02.289 --> 06:04.601
Dude, two times that happened!

06:06.053 --> 06:07.966
Look, Monica's
been working hard all day.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.971
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.

06:11.178 --> 06:12.407
He's right, man.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.494
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
- Okay.

06:15.703 --> 06:18.458
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.

06:18.626 --> 06:21.985
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

06:25.513 --> 06:28.313
That's some gentle comedy, dude.

06:29.196 --> 06:32.157
- We're still going to the game, right?
- Yeah.

06:36.804 --> 06:40.117
This is contestant number 16,
Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.

06:40.287 --> 06:42.280
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

06:42.449 --> 06:43.850
This place is freaking me out.

06:44.011 --> 06:47.849
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.

06:48.055 --> 06:49.205
But we can't leave now.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.609
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...

06:51.779 --> 06:53.692
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.

06:53.861 --> 06:56.662
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.

06:57.224 --> 06:59.137
Phoebe, it's just too weird.

06:59.306 --> 07:01.698
I just saw a 1 -year-old
with pantyhose on.

07:01.869 --> 07:04.864
Oh, I know. We should've
been more prepared.

07:06.033 --> 07:09.996
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.

07:10.157 --> 07:11.990
My God, they just took her sweater off.

07:12.159 --> 07:14.391
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.

07:14.562 --> 07:18.160
Phoebe, come on.
You know what, it's already 3:00.

07:18.365 --> 07:21.360
They haven't even gotten
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.

07:21.569 --> 07:24.369
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!

07:26.373 --> 07:30.131
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Okay.

07:30.297 --> 07:35.616
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
area are in this room right now.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.143
I overheard a judge say that
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

07:41.348 --> 07:42.544
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:42.710 --> 07:45.385
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.

07:45.593 --> 07:49.305
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
these babies something to cry about.

07:49.476 --> 07:53.314
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.

07:53.521 --> 07:54.671
What?

07:54.882 --> 07:57.000
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.

07:57.204 --> 07:59.481
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.805
- Why not?
- Because I already did.

08:08.135 --> 08:12.371
You suck!
Get off the ice, you idiot!

08:13.380 --> 08:15.613
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.

08:15.783 --> 08:18.858
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.

08:19.026 --> 08:23.069
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.

08:23.350 --> 08:27.427
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

08:29.156 --> 08:30.476
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.

08:30.638 --> 08:33.713
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on Ice"...

08:35.402 --> 08:39.685
...I was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

08:40.207 --> 08:43.247
We'd better get going. If we don't
leave now, we're gonna be late.

08:43.450 --> 08:46.685
But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.
The girls will be there.

08:46.854 --> 08:49.051
Let's just stay for one more goal.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.697
- I don't know.
- One more fight.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.697
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:56.183 --> 08:58.301
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.

08:58.465 --> 09:03.419
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?

09:03.591 --> 09:06.870
They've ruined Cranberry Day.

09:07.835 --> 09:09.907
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.

09:10.077 --> 09:12.434
- Here.
- Okay.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.279
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.

09:16.443 --> 09:19.564
We could just slip in, and
no one needs to know where we were.

09:20.608 --> 09:24.525
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:24.692 --> 09:27.288
You just want to put it on your hand.

09:30.858 --> 09:34.012
- You're not at Thanksgiving?
- No, we're late.

09:34.181 --> 09:36.333
- What are you doing here?
- We're late too.

09:37.505 --> 09:40.067
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.

09:40.267 --> 09:43.228
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

09:43.390 --> 09:46.670
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?

09:46.874 --> 09:49.071
- Well...
- Yeah, what's with the trophy?

09:49.236 --> 09:52.676
Well, we were at a spelling bee.

09:53.881 --> 09:55.555
And I won.

09:56.243 --> 10:00.081
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?

10:00.688 --> 10:03.649
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.

10:03.811 --> 10:09.049
Let me see this. "Grand Supreme
Little Darling, New York Division"?

10:09.256 --> 10:11.568
That's me.

10:12.660 --> 10:16.019
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

10:16.183 --> 10:20.021
And it looks like she put makeup on her.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.179
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?

10:25.513 --> 10:27.631
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.

10:27.835 --> 10:31.353
That you would treat her like
some kind of show dog is inexcusable.

10:31.559 --> 10:35.396
- She won a thousand dollars.
- So this is an annual thing?

10:38.886 --> 10:41.687
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

10:43.050 --> 10:45.965
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.

10:46.173 --> 10:49.647
- What are we gonna do?
- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.977
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.

10:54.461 --> 10:58.458
- All right, what are we gonna say?
- We'll say that we were mugged.

10:58.626 --> 11:01.096
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.

11:01.268 --> 11:03.340
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.

11:03.511 --> 11:05.788
No. Here.

11:09.276 --> 11:10.597
Hey!

11:12.680 --> 11:14.832
Do you hear something?

11:19.046 --> 11:22.725
- They're out there.
- Let me see.

11:23.330 --> 11:28.729
I can't believe this. They're an hour late,
and they're just standing there talking.

11:28.896 --> 11:33.531
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.897
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.

11:38.385 --> 11:41.586
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

11:43.310 --> 11:47.387
- Ross' shirt is torn.
- They're late and they're sloppy.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.793
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?

11:52.079 --> 11:55.632
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.600
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.847
How about this?

12:02.009 --> 12:06.211
We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
not 4:00. That way we're right on time.

12:06.373 --> 12:12.488
Or we could plant PCP in the
apartment and call the cops on her.

12:14.141 --> 12:18.503
That would be a good way to get rid
of all the PCP we have lying around.

12:18.666 --> 12:20.579
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

12:20.748 --> 12:24.346
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.

12:29.196 --> 12:32.032
"We know you're out there."

12:34.602 --> 12:36.959
Who do you think it's from?

12:45.092 --> 12:47.689
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

12:47.855 --> 12:50.212
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.

12:50.417 --> 12:55.371
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

12:55.583 --> 12:59.215
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.

12:59.426 --> 13:03.264
Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors,
and whoever loses, goes in first.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.907
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.

13:10.558 --> 13:12.038
I win.

13:12.199 --> 13:15.752
- What is that?
- That's fire. It beats everything.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.878
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?

13:21.008 --> 13:24.083
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
Well-played.

13:24.251 --> 13:26.448
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.

13:26.614 --> 13:28.891
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:30.618 --> 13:34.091
- It's locked.
- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.

13:34.261 --> 13:36.174
When they're having sex on the couch,
it's like:

13:36.343 --> 13:39.544
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"

13:41.228 --> 13:45.020
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.629
Please let us in so we can have
dinner together.

13:47.795 --> 13:52.190
No, everything's cold. The turkey's
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

13:52.359 --> 13:55.195
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's...

13:55.362 --> 13:57.082
What happens to cranberry sauce?

13:57.244 --> 14:00.284
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

14:00.487 --> 14:03.847
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.564
That's a lie! You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.

14:07.775 --> 14:09.733
For the love of God, take it off!

14:12.980 --> 14:15.702
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.

14:15.863 --> 14:18.903
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.

14:21.789 --> 14:24.750
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.

14:26.193 --> 14:28.231
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

14:28.435 --> 14:32.193
- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
- Water balloon!

14:36.564 --> 14:39.126
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.

14:39.326 --> 14:41.444
I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.

14:41.609 --> 14:44.125
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.488
You touch that,
and you will be sorry!

14:46.694 --> 14:50.896
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

14:54.381 --> 14:56.614
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

14:56.824 --> 14:59.101
That's worse than no food.

15:00.548 --> 15:03.668
All you got was
Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.

15:03.871 --> 15:04.987
Stinky?

15:05.192 --> 15:08.392
Please let me stay on this side
of the door.

15:08.596 --> 15:11.955
Oh, I know!
I still have my old key.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.237
We can just unlock the door.

15:14.401 --> 15:17.282
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.

15:17.444 --> 15:19.084
I don't wanna be with them either...

15:19.246 --> 15:22.686
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.572
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology...

15:25.733 --> 15:28.295
...Iook them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.

15:28.455 --> 15:31.097
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you...

15:33.581 --> 15:36.461
...I can do it.

15:36.624 --> 15:38.856
Yeah, he can do it.

15:47.635 --> 15:49.707
It all looks so beautiful.

15:49.877 --> 15:53.510
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.

15:53.721 --> 15:56.761
Enough! A monkey could've made them.

16:01.729 --> 16:04.883
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.088
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.

16:08.255 --> 16:10.647
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.

16:10.858 --> 16:15.253
Come on, you guys. We want
you to know we're very, very sorry.

16:16.423 --> 16:18.416
Right, guys?

16:18.586 --> 16:23.106
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, so sorry.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.747
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.

16:25.913 --> 16:29.033
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?

16:29.236 --> 16:32.231
The floating heads
do make a good point.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.919
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.

16:35.122 --> 16:37.559
- So bad.
- So bad.

16:39.006 --> 16:40.839
Okay.

16:41.008 --> 16:45.449
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.

16:46.053 --> 16:48.205
Dessert?

16:48.415 --> 16:52.732
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?

16:52.940 --> 16:56.857
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."

16:58.025 --> 17:00.222
Here.

17:02.590 --> 17:06.906
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
- Congratulations!

17:08.516 --> 17:11.989
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.591
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...

17:14.762 --> 17:17.643
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.

17:17.845 --> 17:20.726
Really, girls, not cool.

17:22.009 --> 17:25.322
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.

17:25.492 --> 17:27.725
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.

17:27.895 --> 17:30.696
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.

17:30.858 --> 17:34.297
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.

17:34.461 --> 17:38.424
- It's a day to be thankful.
- Don't make me come up there!

17:38.626 --> 17:40.026
It's too late for apologies.

17:40.187 --> 17:42.988
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.

17:43.190 --> 17:45.946
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.509
- Oh, is that what that is?
- Sorry.

17:50.758 --> 17:53.228
Come on, you guys,
let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.555
- Yeah, I'll cook.
- Yeah, let's go out.

17:58.045 --> 18:00.846
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.

18:01.048 --> 18:04.248
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.615
- I'm stuck.
- Joey, that is not gonna work.

18:17.785 --> 18:19.823
No, seriously.

18:19.987 --> 18:22.298
- I'm really wedged in here.
- I'll pull you through.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.586
Okay.

18:24.231 --> 18:26.668
Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.

18:26.874 --> 18:29.106
It's a little late for that.

18:29.957 --> 18:31.551
Hurry up, you gotta do something.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.076
All right, well,
this does not change anything.

18:34.241 --> 18:36.234
We need to get something
to grease his face.

18:36.403 --> 18:38.475
- We got turkey grease.
- Bring it.

18:38.686 --> 18:42.569
I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred
to the vein as a separate person.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.924
Here you go.

18:45.853 --> 18:48.164
Oh, that smells good.

18:55.503 --> 18:58.178
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.

18:59.907 --> 19:01.820
It isn't working.

19:02.029 --> 19:05.388
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.

19:05.593 --> 19:07.825
Can you ever feel your ears?

19:07.995 --> 19:10.192
Interesting.

19:10.638 --> 19:14.429
- Chandler, where are your tools?
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.

19:17.565 --> 19:19.603
I don't have tools.

19:20.087 --> 19:23.048
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.

19:23.210 --> 19:26.489
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.

19:28.536 --> 19:30.813
I'm finding it really hard
not to mess with him.

19:31.018 --> 19:32.931
I stuffed Brussels sprouts
down his pants.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.216
Nice.

19:35.462 --> 19:37.182
Okay, I have to get that.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.498
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.

19:40.668 --> 19:44.824
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.

19:45.793 --> 19:49.949
- It's really starting to hurt.
- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...

19:50.157 --> 19:53.949
...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?

19:54.121 --> 19:55.715
Okay, so push.

19:55.883 --> 19:59.162
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.167
Hey, stop putting things
down my pants.

20:02.329 --> 20:05.085
- Come on, guys, push!
- Yeah, come on, push!

20:05.252 --> 20:07.404
Push! Push!

20:16.584 --> 20:21.868
- My cranberries!
- Man, I got food all over me.

20:23.671 --> 20:26.346
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.

20:27.114 --> 20:30.997
Look! Look! Look what the...
Look what the floating heads did!

20:32.800 --> 20:34.359
I don't care.

20:36.203 --> 20:38.515
What's going on?

20:38.686 --> 20:40.679
That was the adoption agency.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.207
And?

20:43.370 --> 20:47.333
- We're getting a baby!
- Are you serious?!

20:52.860 --> 20:55.855
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.

20:56.063 --> 20:59.183
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.

21:00.548 --> 21:03.428
I'm so happy for you.

21:04.191 --> 21:07.744
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!

21:14.281 --> 21:18.723
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.

21:23.571 --> 21:26.451
I'm just so happy you guys
are finally getting a kid.

21:27.294 --> 21:30.847
- I know.
- Have you considered pageanting?

21:32.419 --> 21:37.134
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.

21:37.344 --> 21:39.098
I know how you feel.

21:41.028 --> 21:42.543
- Really?
- Sure.

21:42.710 --> 21:45.671
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.554
The waiting, the wondering.

21:50.718 --> 21:55.000
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys"R"Us.

21:55.162 --> 21:57.963
She was in stock.

21:58.726 --> 22:00.605
That is the exact same thing.

22:03.090 --> 22:04.080
