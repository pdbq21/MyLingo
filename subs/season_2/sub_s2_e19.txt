00:07.625 --> 00:10.294
Hey, Eddie.

00:10.962 --> 00:14.799
- What are you doing here?
- Watching you sleep.

00:15.341 --> 00:16.300
Why?

00:16.551 --> 00:19.178
It makes me feel peaceful.

00:19.429 --> 00:20.847
Please.

00:21.097 --> 00:22.306
I can't sleep now!

00:22.557 --> 00:25.309
You want me to sing?

00:26.561 --> 00:29.856
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

00:30.106 --> 00:32.025
What are you talking about?

00:32.275 --> 00:35.236
Hannibal Lecter?

00:35.445 --> 00:37.572
Better roommate than you.

00:37.822 --> 00:41.659
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me and you get scared.

00:41.909 --> 00:45.621
What about the other nights
when you don't see me?

00:45.872 --> 00:47.832
Last night you went
and got some water...

00:48.082 --> 00:51.669
...and I was nice enough
to hide behind the door.

00:51.919 --> 00:55.006
I didn't realize that.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.175
Get out now!

00:57.425 --> 00:59.052
You really want me out?

00:59.302 --> 01:00.261
Yes, please.

01:00.511 --> 01:03.264
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

01:03.514 --> 01:04.599
I want you out.

01:04.849 --> 01:08.061
I want to hear it from your lips.

01:08.061 --> 01:09.354
Where'd you hear it before?

01:09.604 --> 01:12.690
All right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.878
You know what I'll do? I'll go
move into my brother's basement.

01:14.928 --> 01:17.909
When he finds out,
I'll go find some place else.

01:18.340 --> 01:23.137
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

01:23.137 --> 01:26.682
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- I heard that.

01:27.099 --> 01:30.227
The One Where Eddie Won't Go

02:18.428 --> 02:20.221
Well, look at you!

02:20.471 --> 02:23.600
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

02:23.850 --> 02:24.726
You like it?

02:24.976 --> 02:27.770
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought...

02:28.021 --> 02:29.022
..."You know what I don't have?"

02:29.272 --> 02:31.733
A mirror?

02:31.983 --> 02:35.945
Fine, make fun.
I think it's jaunty.

02:36.195 --> 02:39.574
For a guy who's recently lost his job,
you're in a good mood.

02:39.824 --> 02:42.994
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

02:43.244 --> 02:47.332
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on <i>Days of our Lives</i>.

02:47.582 --> 02:50.710
That's got to have some kind of cachet.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.879
Cachet? Jaunty?

02:53.129 --> 02:57.342
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

02:57.842 --> 03:00.887
I'm gonna get some coffee.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.006
Go on. You know you want to.

03:11.711 --> 03:13.373
- No?
- No.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.249
So? Did you read the book?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.626
Oh, my God.
It was incredible!

03:20.876 --> 03:23.129
Didn't it, like,
totally speak to you?

03:23.379 --> 03:24.421
What book is this?

03:24.672 --> 03:29.093
You have to read this book.
It's called <i>Be Your Own Wind Keeper</i>.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.512
It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

03:31.762 --> 03:35.808
But there's wind.

03:35.975 --> 03:38.686
And the wind can make us goddesses.

03:38.936 --> 03:44.191
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.569
Men just take our wind?

03:46.819 --> 03:51.907
All the time. Because they
are the lightning-bearers.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.871
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like <i>The Hobbit</i>.

03:57.121 --> 03:59.748
It is nothing like <i>The Hobbit</i>.

03:59.999 --> 04:02.585
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

04:02.835 --> 04:03.961
Except for Richard.

04:04.211 --> 04:07.715
Richard would never steal your wind.

04:07.965 --> 04:10.426
Because he's yummy.

04:10.676 --> 04:11.677
But all the others.

04:11.927 --> 04:14.764
And the part about how
they're always drinking...

04:15.014 --> 04:16.891
...from our pool of inner power.

04:17.141 --> 04:19.351
But God forbid we should take a sip.

04:19.602 --> 04:21.687
Anybody want a cruller?

04:21.937 --> 04:24.440
This is a typical
lightning-bearer thing.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.108
It's like...

04:26.358 --> 04:31.572
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

04:37.489 --> 04:38.757
Who've you been dating?

04:46.203 --> 04:50.791
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.254
You're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

04:55.504 --> 04:57.089
Look at me.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.342
Look at me!

05:00.676 --> 05:04.638
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

05:07.308 --> 05:08.475
Can we get back to me?

05:08.726 --> 05:12.938
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

05:13.188 --> 05:16.233
I already got you an audition
for <i>Another World</i>.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.444
All right!

05:18.694 --> 05:20.571
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.741
You're welcome.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.493
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

05:26.744 --> 05:30.205
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

05:30.206 --> 05:35.776
Hey. There was a time when I used to
play Pickle Tickle with Rick Harrison.

05:37.556 --> 05:40.851
Things change. Roll with them.

05:41.101 --> 05:43.270
But this is a two-line part!

05:43.520 --> 05:45.605
It's like taking a step backwards.

05:45.856 --> 05:49.276
I'm not gonna do this.

05:50.944 --> 05:53.905
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

05:54.156 --> 05:57.409
...and his pyramid of dogs.

05:57.659 --> 06:02.622
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

06:02.998 --> 06:05.000
I'm sorry.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.003
I'll see you.

06:09.004 --> 06:10.339
God!

06:10.589 --> 06:12.674
Oh, God!
I mean, it's just so...

06:12.924 --> 06:14.760
Isn't it?

06:15.010 --> 06:17.471
This is like reading
about my own life!

06:17.721 --> 06:22.184
This book could have been called
<i>Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel</i>!

06:22.434 --> 06:24.311
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

06:24.561 --> 06:28.273
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

06:29.399 --> 06:33.070
Sweetie, we've got to go.

06:36.156 --> 06:40.953
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

06:41.203 --> 06:44.998
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

06:45.248 --> 06:48.418
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

06:48.669 --> 06:55.133
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.804
You go, girl!

07:00.180 --> 07:03.934
I can't pull that off, can I?

07:04.184 --> 07:07.104
Excuse me, your wind?

07:07.354 --> 07:08.814
Yes, my wind.

07:09.064 --> 07:14.152
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

07:19.116 --> 07:22.703
You know I don't...

07:23.745 --> 07:27.499
...have a problem with that.

07:36.842 --> 07:41.763
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

07:42.014 --> 07:43.849
I'm sorry.

07:44.099 --> 07:47.603
You're right.
I don't have to apologize.

07:47.853 --> 07:50.981
Sorry. Damn it!

07:56.111 --> 07:57.696
- What is it?
- I don't know.

07:57.946 --> 08:00.657
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

08:00.908 --> 08:02.492
...and some sacred pool.

08:02.743 --> 08:05.913
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

08:06.163 --> 08:10.500
This is why I don't date
women who read.

08:11.919 --> 08:13.837
What's that?

08:14.087 --> 08:15.589
It's my VIS A bill.

08:15.839 --> 08:19.635
Envelope one of two.

08:20.218 --> 08:24.514
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open it.

08:26.225 --> 08:28.185
Oh, my God!

08:28.435 --> 08:31.813
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

08:32.064 --> 08:36.401
That's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

08:37.444 --> 08:41.448
Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

08:41.698 --> 08:44.034
My animals.

08:44.284 --> 08:49.331
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

08:49.581 --> 08:50.916
I don't know what to do!

08:51.166 --> 08:54.086
You can start by driving a cab
on <i>Another World</i>.

08:54.336 --> 08:56.046
- What?
- That audition?

08:56.296 --> 08:58.048
That's a two-line part!

08:58.298 --> 09:02.427
Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite."

09:02.678 --> 09:04.805
- So what?
- So suck it up, man.

09:05.055 --> 09:06.723
It's a job. It's money.

09:06.974 --> 09:11.603
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

09:11.853 --> 09:14.731
Toilet paper?

09:16.233 --> 09:19.069
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

09:19.319 --> 09:21.113
You're supposed to be my friend!

09:21.363 --> 09:22.197
I am your friend.

09:22.447 --> 09:24.491
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine."

09:24.741 --> 09:27.828
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

09:28.078 --> 09:29.371
But I don't know it.

09:29.621 --> 09:34.668
What I do know is you owe $2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

09:34.668 --> 09:36.420
I'm aware of what I owe.

09:36.670 --> 09:40.465
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

09:40.716 --> 09:43.510
- How long till you get another?
- I don't want to hear this!

09:43.760 --> 09:44.803
I'm just saying...

09:45.053 --> 09:48.724
Well, don't "just say"!

09:49.600 --> 09:52.561
Maybe I should just go.

09:54.062 --> 09:56.732
I'll see you later.

09:56.982 --> 09:58.525
Just think about it.

09:58.775 --> 10:00.611
I don't need to think about it!

10:00.861 --> 10:03.071
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

10:03.322 --> 10:05.157
That was huge!

10:05.407 --> 10:07.784
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

10:08.035 --> 10:09.411
Ross!

10:09.661 --> 10:12.706
You still there?

10:38.278 --> 10:39.571
What are you still doing here?

10:39.822 --> 10:42.658
Just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.578
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

10:46.829 --> 10:48.622
Aren't you forgetting anything?

10:48.872 --> 10:50.999
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.085
He's feistier than the last one.

10:53.335 --> 10:57.840
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.510
Eddie, isn't there something
you're supposed to be doing now?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.138
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

11:04.388 --> 11:08.767
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

11:10.144 --> 11:13.397
I thought we had a deal.
I thought by the time I got...

11:13.647 --> 11:15.315
You know what that is?

11:15.566 --> 11:18.485
Your last roommate's kidney?

11:18.736 --> 11:20.487
That's a tomato.

11:20.738 --> 11:25.367
This one definitely goes
in the display.

11:32.624 --> 11:35.711
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a lemonade to go.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.129
Lemonade?

11:37.379 --> 11:39.548
You okay, man?

11:39.798 --> 11:41.341
It's career stuff.

11:41.592 --> 11:44.386
They killed off
my character on the show.

11:44.636 --> 11:47.181
That's too bad.
How'd they do it?

11:47.431 --> 11:50.309
I fell down an elevator shaft.

11:50.559 --> 11:51.643
That sucks.

11:51.894 --> 11:55.064
I was buried in an avalanche.

11:55.314 --> 11:56.190
What?

11:56.440 --> 12:00.444
I used to be Brice
on <i>All My Children</i>.

12:20.964 --> 12:22.925
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

12:23.175 --> 12:25.344
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

12:25.594 --> 12:28.180
...watching!

12:38.360 --> 12:41.697
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

12:41.947 --> 12:45.784
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

12:46.035 --> 12:50.456
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

12:50.664 --> 12:52.291
- What?
- You! Move out!

12:52.541 --> 12:56.545
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

12:56.795 --> 13:00.257
You want me to move out?

13:07.306 --> 13:13.145
I gotta tell you, that's kind of
out of the blue, don't you think?

13:13.145 --> 13:14.605
This is not out of the blue!

13:14.855 --> 13:18.526
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

13:19.527 --> 13:21.487
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

13:21.737 --> 13:24.865
You don't have to tell me twice.

13:25.241 --> 13:28.661
Someone will be by for my stuff.

13:32.123 --> 13:36.585
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

13:36.836 --> 13:37.837
You want some help?

13:38.087 --> 13:41.549
No help required, <i>chico</i>!

13:47.376 --> 13:48.713
You don't see that everyday.

13:53.397 --> 13:56.734
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

13:56.984 --> 14:00.238
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

14:00.488 --> 14:04.283
Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.

14:04.659 --> 14:07.703
Five-O dollars.

14:07.954 --> 14:11.749
You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

14:11.999 --> 14:15.711
When I was on <i>Days of our Lives</i>
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

14:15.962 --> 14:19.382
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

14:19.632 --> 14:21.425
That's great.

14:21.676 --> 14:25.680
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

14:25.930 --> 14:27.765
...I could attend to the victims...

14:28.015 --> 14:31.394
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

14:31.644 --> 14:34.188
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

14:34.438 --> 14:39.235
Don't thank me for coming in.
At least let me finish.

14:41.988 --> 14:44.198
We could take the expressway...

14:44.448 --> 14:49.245
...but this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

14:50.705 --> 14:54.333
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

14:54.584 --> 14:57.879
I'll have a good day.

15:00.646 --> 15:04.041
Okay, honey, I know you
didn't mean to. I know. Me too.

15:04.250 --> 15:08.079
Rach, hang up. You're supposed
to be taking a goddess quiz.

15:08.121 --> 15:09.556
You should lose, like, 100 points...

15:09.626 --> 15:12.351
...just for calling
your boyfriend in the middle of it.

15:17.924 --> 15:19.175
Question number 28.

15:19.425 --> 15:23.888
"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

15:24.138 --> 15:27.392
I would have to say no.

15:28.309 --> 15:31.020
And I would have to say...

15:31.270 --> 15:32.146
What?

15:32.397 --> 15:34.065
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

15:34.315 --> 15:40.571
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

15:40.822 --> 15:42.573
And his puppet too!

15:42.824 --> 15:44.951
Well, at least
I didn't let some guy...

15:45.201 --> 15:49.622
...into the forest of my righteous
truth on the first date!

15:52.458 --> 15:55.336
- Who?
- Paul!

15:56.421 --> 15:58.756
Moving on, moving on.
Next question.

15:59.007 --> 16:00.466
Okay, number 29.

16:00.717 --> 16:03.636
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

16:03.886 --> 16:06.764
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

16:07.015 --> 16:11.436
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

16:14.022 --> 16:17.358
Not to my recollection.

16:17.608 --> 16:19.652
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

16:19.902 --> 16:22.363
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

16:22.613 --> 16:26.909
Only because you took up
half the circle!

16:29.203 --> 16:33.082
Listen to you two.
It's so sad.

16:33.333 --> 16:37.837
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.214
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason Hurley...

16:40.465 --> 16:44.802
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

16:45.301 --> 16:46.588
That was only an hour?

16:46.729 --> 16:49.404
You are such a leaf blower!

16:50.230 --> 16:52.739
- Pool drainer!
- Twig snapper!

16:52.944 --> 16:54.078
Monkey butt!

16:56.715 --> 17:00.651
- That is not in the book!
- No, but that's what you are!

17:13.072 --> 17:19.119
Be careful with that 3-D <i>Last Supper</i>.
Judas is a little loose.

17:22.456 --> 17:25.084
Oh, my God! What's going on?

17:25.334 --> 17:28.754
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

17:29.004 --> 17:33.008
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

17:33.258 --> 17:36.762
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

17:37.012 --> 17:40.766
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

17:41.016 --> 17:45.437
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

17:45.688 --> 17:47.231
And that's amazing to me.

17:47.481 --> 17:50.526
I could never do what you do.

17:50.776 --> 17:53.404
- Thanks.
- You hold out for something bigger.

17:53.654 --> 17:55.739
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

17:55.990 --> 17:58.784
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.161
- I went.
- Great! How did it go?

18:01.412 --> 18:03.247
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you!

18:03.497 --> 18:06.250
You're living the dream!

18:06.542 --> 18:09.295
All right, then!

18:09.545 --> 18:12.089
Not my parrot.

18:12.339 --> 18:15.342
I can't watch this.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.803
Hey, hold on, hold on.

18:18.053 --> 18:21.807
How much for the...
How much to save the bird?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.767
- Twelve hundred.
- Dollars?

18:24.018 --> 18:26.854
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

18:27.104 --> 18:29.940
It was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

18:30.190 --> 18:32.568
Go ahead with the bird.

18:32.818 --> 18:37.615
Do you have anything for around $200?

18:37.656 --> 18:40.492
The dog.

18:43.203 --> 18:44.371
I'll take it.

18:44.622 --> 18:47.833
My gift to you, man.

18:48.751 --> 18:49.919
Thanks, Ross!

18:50.169 --> 18:52.588
I really liked that bird, though.

18:52.838 --> 18:56.091
But the dog!

19:03.974 --> 19:05.309
Here are your cakes.

19:05.559 --> 19:07.186
We didn't order cake.

19:07.436 --> 19:10.773
No, I know. They're from me.

19:11.023 --> 19:12.650
You guys, this is not good.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.361
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

19:15.611 --> 19:18.197
...without taking it from each other.

19:18.447 --> 19:20.407
You're right.

19:20.658 --> 19:23.744
I love you goddesses.

19:24.995 --> 19:28.290
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.960
- Thank you. So are we good?
- We're good.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.878
We're good?

19:33.128 --> 19:37.550
Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

19:39.218 --> 19:42.805
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

19:45.891 --> 19:47.476
Are you sure this time?

19:47.726 --> 19:49.645
I actually saw him leave.

19:49.895 --> 19:52.523
That guy is holding a human head.

19:52.773 --> 19:56.610
He's holding a human head!

19:57.570 --> 19:58.612
Check it out, man!

19:58.862 --> 20:01.824
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's.

20:02.074 --> 20:03.158
There's no alley behind Macy's.

20:03.409 --> 20:06.161
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

20:06.412 --> 20:10.040
It'll make a hell of a conversation
piece at our next cocktail party.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.502
"Our next cocktail party"?

20:13.752 --> 20:18.132
We'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

20:19.842 --> 20:21.886
Do you remember yesterday?

20:22.136 --> 20:25.806
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

20:29.351 --> 20:34.023
Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

20:39.069 --> 20:40.196
So what happened?

20:40.446 --> 20:42.364
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

20:42.615 --> 20:46.076
Oh, sweet Moses!

20:46.118 --> 20:48.704
So on this road trip,
did you win any money?

20:48.954 --> 20:52.124
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

20:52.374 --> 20:54.960
$300! He buys me these new shoes.

20:55.211 --> 20:56.337
Nice.

20:56.587 --> 21:00.174
See you upstairs. See you, pals!

21:02.593 --> 21:07.306
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

21:25.491 --> 21:27.952
May I help you?

21:28.160 --> 21:31.247
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

21:31.497 --> 21:34.542
I'm sorry.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.876
Have we met?

21:36.126 --> 21:39.171
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

21:39.421 --> 21:41.465
I'm sorry...

21:41.715 --> 21:45.511
...I already have a roommate.

21:51.058 --> 21:57.064
He's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:58.232 --> 22:02.987
No, he moved out and I moved in.

22:03.237 --> 22:06.657
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

22:06.907 --> 22:09.702
I know I would.

22:09.952 --> 22:12.288
That's a good point.

22:12.538 --> 22:13.581
Okay, wow.

22:13.831 --> 22:17.626
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

22:19.211 --> 22:21.547
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, no problem.

22:21.797 --> 22:24.508
See you.

22:29.305 --> 22:34.059
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

22:34.310 --> 22:38.147
- You want me to help you unpack?
- Nah, I'm okay.

22:38.397 --> 22:42.026
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

22:42.276 --> 22:44.987
I mean, I do have to, but...

22:45.237 --> 22:48.365
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really...

22:48.616 --> 22:51.494
I mean, this is...

22:51.744 --> 22:54.830
Welcome home, man.

23:02.755 --> 23:06.759
- A little foos?
- Absolutely!

23:07.843 --> 23:10.096
What happened to the foosball?

23:10.346 --> 23:13.307
It's a cantaloupe.

23:16.778 --> 23:19.614
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

23:19.864 --> 23:23.576
He paid a lot of money for it.

23:28.164 --> 23:31.459
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

23:31.710 --> 23:35.255
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

23:35.505 --> 23:39.259
Well, I had a whole ceramic
zoo thing going over there.

23:39.509 --> 23:42.367
But without the other ones,
it looks tacky.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.867
Yeah, with things like this,
more is always better.

23:47.871 --> 23:52.167
Is he housetrained or will he leave
little bathroom tiles all over?

23:52.417 --> 23:54.961
Stay.

23:55.253 --> 23:56.504
Stay!

23:56.755 --> 24:00.175
Good fake dog.
