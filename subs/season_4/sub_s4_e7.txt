WEBVTT

00:03.803 --> 00:06.101
I just saw Kathy naked.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.136
It was like torture.

00:08.775 --> 00:12.802
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.273
It keeps getting worse.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.814
It bad enough that I'm in love
with my roommate's girlfriend.

00:19.052 --> 00:23.955
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

00:24.157 --> 00:26.887
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.357
And now I have seen her naked.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.224
At least with her clothes on...

00:33.500 --> 00:36.833
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.503
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

00:42.642 --> 00:44.041
Smooth!

00:48.314 --> 00:51.715
-Could everyone see up his robe?
-Oh, my God!

00:53.186 --> 00:55.086
The One Where
Chandler Crosses the Line

01:40.867 --> 01:42.698
-Here you go.
-I'll call you.

01:42.902 --> 01:43.994
Great!

01:45.805 --> 01:47.636
Hey, hey. Who was that?

01:47.907 --> 01:50.137
Casey. We're going out tonight.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.937
Going out? Wow!

01:55.782 --> 01:58.478
It didn't work out
with Kathy? Bummer.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.016
No, things are fine.

02:00.253 --> 02:04.713
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

02:05.258 --> 02:06.247
-What?
-Yeah.

02:06.392 --> 02:10.351
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.256
You're going out with Kathy!

02:14.400 --> 02:16.163
Yeah. Why are you upset?

02:16.369 --> 02:17.802
Well, I'm upset...

02:18.104 --> 02:19.128
...for you.

02:20.707 --> 02:24.734
Sex with an endless line of beautiful
women must be unfulfilling.

02:26.946 --> 02:30.575
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.216
Look, Joey.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.788
Kathy's clearly not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.215
But, Casey....

02:37.457 --> 02:40.290
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.126
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

02:44.397 --> 02:46.592
...and gets you.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.466
You got all that
from the back of her head?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.729
I think it's time
for you to settle down.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.736
Make a choice.
Pick a lane.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.264
Who's Elaine?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.739
Little Tony Tarzan

03:03.016 --> 03:07.476
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease

03:10.523 --> 03:12.354
I don't know the next verse.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.224
You could just go:

03:15.495 --> 03:16.985
Greatest of ease

03:18.398 --> 03:19.956
Then go right into it.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.492
I like that.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.471
How do you know about...?

03:26.739 --> 03:29.207
You know, I used to play.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.401
That's right.
The keyboards?

03:32.645 --> 03:36.308
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.746
That's when
I really found my sound.

03:42.021 --> 03:46.048
Orange juice just came out
of my nose, but it was worth it.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.661
Oh, my God!

03:49.929 --> 03:52.523
I completely forgot about
your sound.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.693
He'd lock himself in
the basement for hours.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.766
No one was ever allowed to hear
the sound.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.333
I want to hear the sound.

04:03.343 --> 04:07.370
No, I mean,
I haven't played in so long.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.916
Well, it's really personal stuff.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.381
Play that funky music, white boy.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.351
-Yeah, come on.
-No, you guys.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.423
My keyboards are all the way
Yeah, okay.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.725
Who wants to get dinner later?
I wanna try that new ltalian restaurant.

04:27.867 --> 04:32.361
Supposed to be really good. Saw a
lot of Chinese people eating in there.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.070
What are you talking about?

04:34.240 --> 04:38.734
You said some restaurant must be good
because Chinese people were eating there.

04:39.245 --> 04:42.772
That's because it was
a Chinese restaurant.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.848
I still wanna go.
Who wants to come?

04:46.019 --> 04:49.887
Oh, I can't. I got two dinner dates
tonight, so I gotta get ready.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.254
All right, girls' night out.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.328
Sorry, but we have to prep that
catering thing for tomorrow.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.862
Oh, that's right.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.398
I wish I could eat
in restaurants alone.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.002
You should try it.
It's a really good thing to do.

05:04.170 --> 05:09.164
I just think I'd feel really self-conscious.
Like I was on display or something.

05:09.342 --> 05:13.779
I was on display once.
Nothing like eating alone.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.887
I just had a great time with myself.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.623
Well, this could be a good story.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.093
At dinner.
It was so liberating.

05:34.233 --> 05:38.727
You know, I don't need people to
have fun. I'm fun. I'm a fun girl.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.431
Are you a naughty girl?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.006
No, just fun. Fun. Good. Fun.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.137
-See, I told you you'd have fun.
-I know.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.479
Although I must say that I totally
judge any woman I see eating alone.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.086
-Why?
-What's wrong with a woman eating alone?

05:55.254 --> 05:58.417
Well, obviously something.
She's eating alone.

05:59.325 --> 06:00.314
Okay, guys.

06:00.493 --> 06:03.155
All right! Bring it on, you!

06:06.766 --> 06:08.063
Here we go.

06:14.207 --> 06:19.042
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.713
So it's important that
you understand...

06:21.914 --> 06:24.348
...it's about communicating...

06:24.884 --> 06:28.081
...very private emotions.

06:34.794 --> 06:35.852
You know....

06:36.062 --> 06:40.021
You should think of my work...

06:40.233 --> 06:43.691
...as wordless sound poems.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.040
-That's what
-Oh, my God, play.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.510
Well, you know, that was...

07:30.216 --> 07:31.274
...terrific!

07:33.019 --> 07:34.350
Really...

07:35.021 --> 07:36.454
...bitchen.

07:38.524 --> 07:41.857
Wow! It was so wow!

07:42.195 --> 07:43.287
Really?

07:43.963 --> 07:48.400
Yeah! I mean, you should
play in public.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.903
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's

07:52.205 --> 07:54.298
I want to play you another piece.

07:56.843 --> 08:01.337
I left my helicopter sounds on
another disk. I'll be right back, okay?

08:03.316 --> 08:07.013
This is so nice.
I mean, I am so....

08:11.224 --> 08:14.489
God bless my dad for
soundproofing the basement.

08:16.162 --> 08:20.531
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.394
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!

08:25.071 --> 08:27.005
It was so moving.

08:27.139 --> 08:30.700
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.673
You mean, music?

08:37.917 --> 08:39.248
I know what you think.

08:39.485 --> 08:43.148
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

08:45.558 --> 08:46.786
Come in.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.488
Oh, God! Is that Baywatch?

08:51.764 --> 08:55.063
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.660
-So is Joey around?
-No, he's not back yet.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.237
Come in, have a seat.
Bow or stern?

09:02.408 --> 09:04.501
I don't have a preference. You?

09:04.810 --> 09:06.778
I like it in the stern.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.039
Of the boat.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.153
It's me. Casey and l
had a little car trouble.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.154
-What happened?
-We broke down.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.452
I have to get transmission fluid.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.391
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

09:26.666 --> 09:31.126
-Why can't you tell her?
-I think my time is about to

09:37.143 --> 09:38.508
I thought your time ran out.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.146
Me too, but I guess I do have

09:43.849 --> 09:47.808
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.352
I guess it's just you and me, then.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.355
-Okay.
-Yeah, I think it is.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.065
So, what'd you do today?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.858
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.935
-Looks great!
-And then it got canceled.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.401
-I could cut it.
-Really? Do you do that?

10:09.642 --> 10:14.409
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

10:14.714 --> 10:16.045
Dog grooming?

10:16.916 --> 10:18.941
Don't make my tail too poofy.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.491
You have really great hair.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.228
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

10:36.168 --> 10:38.068
You know who also
has great hair is Joey.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.261
Yes, Joey has great hair.

10:40.506 --> 10:44.943
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.090
What are you doing?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.824
Checking to see if it's even.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.795
Looks good.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.465
The phone!
The phone's making sounds!

11:16.642 --> 11:17.802
Hey, dude, it's me.

11:18.010 --> 11:18.999
Hey, it's Joey!

11:20.646 --> 11:22.944
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.811
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.181
-What?
-It fell out.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.821
I just figured we hit a dog.

11:34.126 --> 11:37.493
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.

11:38.297 --> 11:39.628
It's Joey.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.401
No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

11:44.603 --> 11:47.595
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.037
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.937
I should probably go.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.959
I forgot my purse.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.367
I really did.
I forgot my purse.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.315
-This is bad! It's bad!
-Horrible!

12:31.817 --> 12:34.513
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.612
The kiss was good.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.555
-But that's bad!
-Here's what we do.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.727
-We forget it happened.
-What?

12:41.927 --> 12:46.955
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.624
Can you really do that?

12:50.102 --> 12:53.196
I have to. He's my best friend.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.997
And you're seeing him.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.202
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

12:58.444 --> 13:02.210
-But with you
-No, don't! Don't, see?

13:02.515 --> 13:05.313
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.112
I'm sorry.

13:10.556 --> 13:14.549
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.020
I think we have to.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.012
Are you still out there?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.659
Electrifying

13:53.265 --> 13:57.258
Infinite time

13:57.670 --> 14:00.833
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

14:01.373 --> 14:05.036
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go!

14:21.093 --> 14:24.028
Thank you very much!

14:24.430 --> 14:26.421
Hey, aren't you up next?

14:27.766 --> 14:31.065
-I'm not playing tonight.
-Why not?

14:32.137 --> 14:34.264
I can't follow Ross.

14:34.974 --> 14:38.341
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

14:38.544 --> 14:40.876
...who had to
follow the Beatles. No.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.942
Ross sucks.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.617
The place has emptied because of him.

14:49.989 --> 14:53.755
Oh, my God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

14:54.326 --> 14:58.160
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.667
You suck too.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.070
You're awful.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.744
You guys!

15:18.817 --> 15:20.648
You suck too!

15:26.125 --> 15:30.653
Man! I can't believe
I locked myself out again!

15:31.163 --> 15:32.960
Hang on, buddy.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.195
Oh, my God! What happened?

15:39.471 --> 15:42.304
-Did you do all this? Why?
-I sure did.

15:42.508 --> 15:46.171
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.777
You're amazing.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.340
No, this is amazing.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.912
A TV that appears
as if from nowhere!

15:57.556 --> 15:59.717
That's the dream!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.620
How did you afford all this?

16:01.827 --> 16:04.887
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

16:05.297 --> 16:07.822
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.693
I don't know.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.165
No, you are.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.737
You do this, you give me advice....

16:14.974 --> 16:18.842
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

16:19.078 --> 16:20.170
I'll do that.

16:20.579 --> 16:21.603
With Casey?

16:21.814 --> 16:25.181
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.849
-Or Casey.
-No, Kathy.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.248
-Could be Casey.
-No, Kathy.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.423
Consider Casey.

16:33.225 --> 16:36.683
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.692
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

16:39.999 --> 16:44.265
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

16:52.745 --> 16:57.580
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.045
Thanks.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.815
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

17:05.024 --> 17:07.185
...and, you know, my talent.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.516
Is that true?

17:11.196 --> 17:13.391
Well, kind of, yeah.

17:13.665 --> 17:17.396
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

17:17.603 --> 17:21.164
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

17:23.342 --> 17:24.331
See, but....

17:24.576 --> 17:29.343
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

17:29.581 --> 17:32.744
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.918
If it bothers you this much...

17:35.187 --> 17:38.782
...then I won't play anymore.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.686
No, don't do that.

17:42.961 --> 17:48.092
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

17:50.936 --> 17:53.063
Yeah, okay.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.211
-I'd love to, but I have plans on Sunday.
-Well, maybe some other time.

18:01.346 --> 18:06.443
-Sure. Just give me a call, I'm in the book.
-Okay. Thanks a lot. See you.

18:09.988 --> 18:12.980
What are you doing?
He is cute, and he's a doctor.

18:13.392 --> 18:18.056
-How do you know?
-Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.596
-Well, I have plans on Sunday.
-With who?

18:21.733 --> 18:24.361
-Me.
-Oh, God.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.994
You are the one who told me how
important it is to spend time alone.

18:28.140 --> 18:31.109
I can't just go out with that guy
when I have plans with myself.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.336
Wouldn't be fair to me.

18:33.812 --> 18:37.646
So basically you're saying you
don't want to cheat on yourself.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.150
Well, if you wanna make
me sound crazy.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.146
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.485
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

18:50.262 --> 18:51.456
I kissed Kathy.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.028
Are you serious?

18:53.265 --> 18:55.130
-Does Joey know?
-No.

18:55.334 --> 18:59.100
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

18:59.872 --> 19:03.433
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.507
Which we all appreciate.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.347
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

19:10.649 --> 19:13.117
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

19:13.519 --> 19:17.319
Don't say that!
That's not true, is it?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.115
Yeah, he loves you.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.952
Then why didn't you
tell me to do that?

19:22.394 --> 19:24.555
I said something to Phoebe.

19:24.796 --> 19:27.458
And I thought it was
a really good idea.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.692
-Yeah, I remember.
-Oh, my God!

19:31.336 --> 19:33.031
What am I going to do?

19:33.305 --> 19:36.741
-You'll have to tell him.
-Why do I have to tell him?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.667
-Because you do.
-Yeah, I know.

19:43.882 --> 19:47.045
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

19:50.856 --> 19:54.952
I don't know if this is
working out. I think....

19:55.093 --> 19:58.187
I think I wanna see other people.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.231
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.335
It's not that I don't
enjoy this. I do.

20:04.469 --> 20:08.462
I just wanna see
what else is out there.

20:09.808 --> 20:12.299
Hey, Guy. What are you doing here?

20:12.444 --> 20:14.742
I work across the street.

20:14.913 --> 20:18.747
-lt turns out I'm gonna be free Sunday.
-I wish you had called me.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.682
I just told them I'd work this weekend.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.481
Okay, well, maybe next weekend.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.556
-Definitely. I'll see you.
-Okay.

20:25.958 --> 20:30.122
Yeah, you'll be talking to me never,
because you're a freak who eats alone.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.004
Sambuca margarita?

20:40.672 --> 20:42.196
It that a real thing?

20:42.407 --> 20:45.570
Well, we only had sambuca,
so it is now.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.571
Listen, Joe. I need to I need
to talk to you about something.

20:51.717 --> 20:52.877
What's up?

20:54.286 --> 20:55.753
It's about Kathy.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.186
I like her.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.856
I like her a lot, actually.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.261
-You do?
-Yeah.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.763
Your timing couldn't be better.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.797
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.225
What?

21:12.704 --> 21:16.868
-Yeah, she broke up with me.
-When?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.303
Just now, after acting class.

21:19.578 --> 21:23.275
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

21:25.717 --> 21:28.743
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

21:28.987 --> 21:33.287
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

21:33.492 --> 21:36.086
Yes, but I don't have to.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.956
No, it's okay.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.429
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

21:47.906 --> 21:51.069
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.840
You might have your work
cut out for you.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.983
When I talked to her, I got
the feeling she's into some other guy.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.987
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.991
I think I know who the other guy is.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.456
Who?

22:12.197 --> 22:13.630
It's me.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.594
I'm the other guy.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.529
What?

22:18.837 --> 22:23.433
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

22:23.575 --> 22:26.305
...and one thing led
to another, and....

22:26.578 --> 22:29.012
And what?
Did you sleep with her?

22:29.214 --> 22:33.150
-No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

22:34.086 --> 22:36.850
-How is that worse?
-It's the same!

22:37.989 --> 22:41.390
There's nothing I could do.
I think I'm in love with her!

22:41.593 --> 22:42.582
Who cares?

22:42.894 --> 22:45.886
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you!

22:46.198 --> 22:49.463
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

22:49.668 --> 22:54.503
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line!

22:54.740 --> 22:57.402
The line is a dot to you!

22:58.110 --> 23:02.206
Yes, right! And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.074
Oh, my God. Is that
why you bought all this stuff?

23:06.685 --> 23:07.879
You know what?

23:08.186 --> 23:10.552
I will not watch your TV.

23:10.789 --> 23:12.620
I won't listen to your stereo.

23:12.858 --> 23:17.124
And there's a loaf in the new
bread maker I won't eat. Know why?

23:17.362 --> 23:21.992
-Probably because
-It's all tainted with your betrayal!

23:22.667 --> 23:28.333
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you either.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.913
And just so you know...

23:36.481 --> 23:38.745
...I made that bread for you.

23:52.931 --> 23:56.833
Oh, my God! He's lost it.
He's totally lost it.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.265
What?

24:00.205 --> 24:02.469
This cannot get any worse.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.801
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.450
Thank you. Thanks.

24:21.092 --> 24:22.457
I lost it.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.062
I won't play anymore.

24:26.331 --> 24:29.357
Would you?
Can you finish my set?

24:30.235 --> 24:31.702
After that? Yeah.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.200
No, I mean, if I can help.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.213
Yeah, like I could lose it.

24:45.917 --> 24:46.906
What?

24:47.152 --> 24:49.814
I played bad on purpose, guys.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.521
Okay, you were trying to
play bad this whole time.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.125
No. Just that last song.
