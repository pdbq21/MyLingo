00:04.082 --> 00:07.142
Hey, how much you give me <br/>to eat this whole jar of olives?

00:07.452 --> 00:10.683
l won't give you anything, <br/>but you'll owe me $2.95.

00:11.557 --> 00:13.252
Done.

00:14.493 --> 00:16.586
l need an atlas! <br/>l need an atlas!

00:16.762 --> 00:18.821
Why? Do you have a report due?

00:20.132 --> 00:23.192
l have a date with this diplomat <br/>l met while giving free massages...

00:23.368 --> 00:27.964
...outside the U.N. and.... <br/>l don't know where his country is.

00:28.307 --> 00:30.741
Okay, let's start with <br/>the free massages at the U.N.

00:30.909 --> 00:34.743
lt's my new thing. l figure, <br/>bodies at peace make peace.

00:36.648 --> 00:39.640
You might just get <br/>the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

00:40.285 --> 00:41.946
So, what country is this guy from?

00:46.758 --> 00:47.782
There's a G in there.

00:49.328 --> 00:52.024
-Well, where's that? <br/>-ln your atlas.

00:52.798 --> 00:54.060
l don't have an atlas.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.996
But, wait, l do have a globe. <br/>Hold on.

00:57.302 --> 00:58.667
So what's this guy like?

00:59.771 --> 01:01.705
Well, he's very...

01:01.873 --> 01:03.238
...dashing, you know?

01:03.475 --> 01:05.204
And very, very sophisticated.

01:05.377 --> 01:07.038
And he doesn't speak any English...

01:07.245 --> 01:10.442
...but according to his translator <br/>he totally gets me.

01:11.183 --> 01:12.445
Okay, here you go.

01:12.851 --> 01:14.716
What is this?

01:15.854 --> 01:17.947
lt's a globe.

01:18.690 --> 01:20.157
And a pencil sharpener.

01:21.727 --> 01:24.924
People of Earth, surrender.

01:27.599 --> 01:29.658
Giant alien.

01:30.869 --> 01:32.928
Five tiny heads.

01:34.406 --> 01:37.273
Anybody need anything copied? <br/>l'm going to the Xerox place.

01:37.442 --> 01:38.431
No, thanks.

01:38.610 --> 01:41.943
Okay, listen, just give me <br/>anything l can make two of.

01:42.414 --> 01:44.575
lf you don't have anything to copy, <br/>why go there?

01:44.883 --> 01:49.149
Are you going down there to gawk at that <br/>hot girl with the bellybutton ring again?

01:49.488 --> 01:50.887
Yeah. You wanna come?

01:52.391 --> 01:54.018
Yeah.

01:55.927 --> 01:57.087
The One Where <br/>Ross and Rachel Take a Break

02:44.109 --> 02:47.306
Come on, Chloe. <br/>Finish up with your customer first.

02:47.479 --> 02:50.346
Come on, Chloe. <br/>Come on, Chloe!

02:50.515 --> 02:51.709
Can l help you?

02:54.252 --> 02:55.241
You know what?

02:55.420 --> 02:58.287
We're having second thoughts <br/>about our copying needs...

02:58.490 --> 03:01.789
...and we'll need a little <br/>more time to think about it.

03:02.194 --> 03:05.630
Chloe, switch with me. There are <br/>some guys here who got a crush on you.

03:07.299 --> 03:09.358
Okay, that hurt us.

03:09.868 --> 03:13.167
Hi, guys. l haven't seen <br/>you since this morning.

03:13.638 --> 03:15.469
Well....

03:17.375 --> 03:18.399
You know.

03:20.078 --> 03:22.546
Hey, what are you guys <br/>doing tomorrow night?

03:22.714 --> 03:23.976
Both of us?

03:24.583 --> 03:26.881
Maybe. Does that scare you?

03:31.723 --> 03:34.556
Relax. <br/>Just lsaac's deejaying at The Philly.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.557
-You should come. <br/>-We'll be there.

03:36.728 --> 03:39.288
Great. l'll see you then.

03:39.464 --> 03:41.193
All right. Rock on.

03:54.079 --> 03:59.608
He says that walking with you makes <br/>this strange city feel like home.

04:00.418 --> 04:03.182
Me too. Although <br/>this city is my home, so....

04:03.355 --> 04:06.347
So that's dumb, what l said. <br/>Don't tell him l said that.

04:06.525 --> 04:09.551
Just you make something up.

04:18.937 --> 04:21.235
Nice. Thank you.

04:21.706 --> 04:24.072
This is me, here.

04:33.385 --> 04:36.013
Your eyes are very pretty.

04:36.922 --> 04:39.254
Thank you very much.

04:39.424 --> 04:40.413
Oh, thank you.

04:49.968 --> 04:51.731
He would like to kiss you.

04:55.373 --> 04:58.103
Okay. You know what, <br/>you don't have to do that now.

04:58.276 --> 05:00.267
No, no, not him! <br/>No, you don't.

05:05.550 --> 05:07.575
The moment's over.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.900
See, there it is, right there.

05:24.069 --> 05:26.162
Wow, it's small.

05:26.504 --> 05:29.405
Yeah, but Sergei said <br/>it took the Germans six weeks...

05:29.574 --> 05:32.042
...to get all the way across it.

05:32.510 --> 05:34.569
-So you had fun? <br/>-Yeah.

05:34.746 --> 05:37.146
Except for-- You know <br/>when you're on a date...

05:37.315 --> 05:39.112
...and you're getting along great...

05:39.317 --> 05:42.047
...but the guy's translator <br/>keeps getting in the way?

05:42.220 --> 05:44.120
No.

05:45.156 --> 05:46.783
-Hey. <br/>-Hey.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.482
What, is Rach in her room?

05:48.660 --> 05:51.151
No, she's still at work, <br/>but she said to call her.

05:51.329 --> 05:54.594
What? ls she gonna cancel <br/>on me again? How could she do this?

05:54.766 --> 05:56.529
Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?

05:56.701 --> 06:00.501
All right, Ross. This is the extent <br/>of my knowledge on the subject.

06:00.672 --> 06:01.798
''Call Rachel.''

06:02.974 --> 06:04.305
What's that on the bottom?

06:04.476 --> 06:08.378
That's my doodle of <br/>a ladybug with a top hat.

06:08.847 --> 06:10.781
She's fancy.

06:14.185 --> 06:15.277
-Hello. <br/>-Hey, honey.

06:15.453 --> 06:17.683
-Hi. <br/>-Hey, how's it going?

06:17.856 --> 06:20.154
Well, kind of having <br/>an underwear emergency.

06:20.325 --> 06:24.421
Oh, yeah? What happened? Someone <br/>scare you? Make you laugh too hard?

06:24.596 --> 06:27.224
There was a disaster in shipping. <br/>l have to get this order in.

06:27.399 --> 06:30.835
Honey, l'm so sorry, but it looks like <br/>l'm gonna be here all night.

06:31.336 --> 06:33.804
What? Well, how about <br/>l come up there?

06:33.972 --> 06:37.840
No. No. No, honey, please. l've got.... <br/>l just have too much to deal with.

06:38.009 --> 06:41.410
Anyway, l'm going out <br/>with Sergei again tonight, and....

06:41.579 --> 06:43.410
Could you be the translator's date...

06:43.581 --> 06:47.950
...so that when it's time for our <br/>alone time you two can split off?

06:49.054 --> 06:50.919
You know, he's kind of cute.

06:51.089 --> 06:54.422
Kind of cute like really kind of cute? <br/>Or kind of cute like your friend...

06:54.592 --> 06:55.650
...Spackle-Back Larry?

06:56.528 --> 06:58.120
Hey, don't call him that.

06:58.396 --> 07:01.456
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

07:05.270 --> 07:08.762
You know, maybe we should get going. <br/>What time did Chloe say to get there?

07:08.940 --> 07:11.033
-1 0:30. <br/>-What time is it now?

07:11.643 --> 07:13.042
4:30.

07:13.878 --> 07:15.140
Yeah, so we'll hang out.

07:20.785 --> 07:23.948
Hey, remember when she brought <br/>up that thing about the three of us?

07:24.155 --> 07:26.180
Yes, vividly.

07:27.025 --> 07:30.859
-She was kidding about that, right? <br/>-Yeah, l think so.

07:35.266 --> 07:36.995
Yeah, l think so.

07:37.736 --> 07:41.866
God, it'd be weird if that situation <br/>presented itself tonight.

07:43.074 --> 07:44.974
Yeah, l mean...

07:45.577 --> 07:48.375
...what would we do?

07:50.181 --> 07:52.411
Dude, l don't know.

07:53.351 --> 07:54.511
-She was kidding. <br/>-Yeah.

07:54.686 --> 07:56.415
She was....

07:56.588 --> 07:59.318
You know, just in case, <br/>we should come up with ground rules.

07:59.491 --> 08:01.425
Yeah. For sure. Okay.

08:01.593 --> 08:04.426
Probably want the first one to be, <br/>''Never open your eyes.''

08:06.131 --> 08:10.261
You know? Because you don't <br/>want to be doing something...

08:10.435 --> 08:13.404
...and then look up, right?

08:13.671 --> 08:16.333
And see something that <br/>you don't want to be seeing.

08:16.508 --> 08:17.770
-You know? <br/>-Yeah.

08:17.942 --> 08:20.775
Good call. Nice. <br/>Hold it! Hold it!

08:22.280 --> 08:24.942
What if my eyes are closed, and...?

08:26.251 --> 08:28.151
And my hand is out there...?

08:29.921 --> 08:31.388
Okay, eyes open at all times.

08:36.394 --> 08:40.023
How do we decide where we...

08:40.198 --> 08:41.563
...you know, each would...

08:41.800 --> 08:42.892
...you know...

08:44.402 --> 08:45.801
-...be? <br/>-Right.

08:45.970 --> 08:48.302
Right. Well, you know, <br/>we could flip for it.

08:48.473 --> 08:51.533
Yeah, l guess. But, like, <br/>what's heads and what's tails?

08:53.978 --> 08:57.641
Well, if you don't know that, <br/>then l don't want to do this with you.

09:00.452 --> 09:01.441
No, no, no.

09:01.619 --> 09:05.578
l am looking at a purchase order right here, <br/>and it clearly states that we ordered...

09:05.757 --> 09:10.353
...the Riviera bikini in a variety <br/>of sizes and colors and--

09:11.563 --> 09:14.259
What does it matter what l'm wearing?

09:14.532 --> 09:17.899
Could l please speak to your supervisor? <br/>Thank you. We're holding.

09:18.069 --> 09:20.003
-Hi. <br/>-Oh, my God!

09:20.171 --> 09:23.937
-What are you doing here? <br/>-Well, you said you couldn't go out, so....

09:24.142 --> 09:27.339
You brought a picnic. <br/>What a boyfriend.

09:27.512 --> 09:30.743
That's it. On Monday, <br/>l start wearing makeup.

09:30.982 --> 09:34.611
Ross, honey, this is very nice, <br/>but l've got a crisis.

09:34.786 --> 09:36.276
Yeah, but l've got couscous!

09:37.922 --> 09:40.413
Honey, l'm sorry, <br/>l know it's our anniversary...

09:40.592 --> 09:43.959
...but l told you on the phone, <br/>l don't have time to stop.

09:44.129 --> 09:47.690
Okay, you don't have to stop. <br/>l'm invisible. l'm not here.

09:47.866 --> 09:49.493
Yeah, but l don't--

09:49.667 --> 09:52.135
Who approved that order?

09:52.303 --> 09:55.466
Well, there is no Mark Robinson <br/>in this office.

09:55.807 --> 09:58.970
-Get me Mark on the phone! <br/>-l love Mark. Do you know Mark?

09:59.577 --> 10:00.635
Yeah.

10:00.812 --> 10:03.042
Let me just check that <br/>with what l've got here.

10:03.214 --> 10:06.741
All right. See, 038 is not the number <br/>for this store. 038 is Atlanta.

10:12.257 --> 10:14.054
Pepper?

10:15.059 --> 10:17.619
-None for me. <br/>-Okay, sorry....

10:19.130 --> 10:22.622
l'm sorry. As l was saying, <br/>the store number is wrong.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.030
And l'm sorry, but that is-- <br/>Oh, my God!

10:32.610 --> 10:36.273
Excuse me, l'm sorry. l'll have to call <br/>you back. l've got Shemp in my office.

10:39.450 --> 10:41.577
-What are you doing? <br/>-l'm sorry.

10:41.753 --> 10:45.348
But, hey, somebody's off the phone. <br/>How about a glass of wine...

10:45.557 --> 10:48.424
...by the fire? <br/>l can get it going again.

10:48.593 --> 10:52.085
Ross, you're not listening to me. <br/>l don't have time to stop.

10:52.263 --> 10:55.198
-Come on, you don't have 1 0 minutes? <br/>-l don't have 1 0 minutes!

10:55.366 --> 10:59.063
-Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes? <br/>-Hey, Ross, l told you l don't!

10:59.237 --> 11:01.967
Don't yell at me, okay? This is <br/>the most l've seen you all week.

11:02.907 --> 11:05.637
Look, l cannot do this right now, okay?

11:05.810 --> 11:09.109
l've got a deadline. Would you <br/>just go home. l'll talk to you later.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.575
-Yeah, but wait-- <br/>-Goodbye!

11:18.690 --> 11:21.318
Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

11:27.065 --> 11:29.898
-Hey. <br/>-Hi.

11:30.068 --> 11:32.332
Look, about what happened earlier--

11:32.570 --> 11:36.028
l completely understand. <br/>You were stressed.

11:39.544 --> 11:42.536
l was gonna give you a chance <br/>to apologize to me.

11:43.248 --> 11:45.739
For what? For letting you <br/>throw me out of your office?

11:45.917 --> 11:48.977
You had no right <br/>coming down to my office, Ross.

11:49.153 --> 11:52.953
You do not bring a picnic basket <br/>to somebody's work...

11:53.124 --> 11:55.115
...unless maybe they were <br/>a park ranger.

11:57.629 --> 12:01.190
Well, excuse me for wanting to be <br/>with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

12:01.466 --> 12:02.865
Boy, what an ass am l.

12:04.168 --> 12:07.069
But l told you <br/>l didn't have the time.

12:07.238 --> 12:08.899
Yeah, well, you never have the time.

12:09.073 --> 12:11.667
l don't feel like l even <br/>have a girlfriend anymore.

12:11.843 --> 12:13.003
What do you want from me?

12:13.177 --> 12:16.374
You want me to quit my job so <br/>you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

12:16.547 --> 12:20.313
No, but it would be nice <br/>if you'd realize that it's just a job.

12:20.785 --> 12:24.812
-Just a job? <br/>-Yes.

12:24.989 --> 12:29.016
Do you realize this is the first time in my <br/>life l'm doing something l care about?

12:29.193 --> 12:32.287
This is the first time l'm doing <br/>something l'm actually good at?

12:32.563 --> 12:34.053
l mean, if you don't get that--

12:34.232 --> 12:36.700
l get that. l get that big-time, <br/>and l'm happy for you.

12:36.868 --> 12:39.666
l'm tired of having a relationship <br/>with your answering machine.

12:39.837 --> 12:42.829
-l don't know what to do anymore. <br/>-Well, neither do l!

12:44.642 --> 12:46.041
ls this about Mark?

12:48.046 --> 12:49.809
-Oh, my God! <br/>-Okay, it's not.

12:49.981 --> 12:55.886
Oh, my God! l cannot keep having this <br/>same fight over and over again, Ross.

12:56.054 --> 12:58.648
-You're making this too hard. <br/>-l'm making this too hard?

12:58.823 --> 13:02.554
-Okay, what do you want me to do? <br/>-l don't know. l don't know. Look...

13:02.727 --> 13:04.217
...maybe we should take a break.

13:04.395 --> 13:08.832
Okay. Okay, fine. You're right. <br/>Let's take a break. Let's cool off. Okay.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.163
Let's get some frozen yogurt <br/>or something.

13:13.604 --> 13:14.593
No.

13:17.775 --> 13:19.800
A break from us.

13:32.824 --> 13:35.486
And the advances in collating <br/>in the past five years....

13:35.660 --> 13:37.753
l mean, we just got <br/>in an X-5000, you know?

13:37.962 --> 13:41.261
The X-5000 makes an X-50 <br/>look like a T-7 1 .

13:45.136 --> 13:46.728
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy!

13:48.072 --> 13:49.903
-Hi, Ross! <br/>-Hi, Chloe.

13:50.074 --> 13:52.804
l want you to meet <br/>some friends of mine.

13:54.579 --> 13:55.944
This guy's my hero.

13:56.114 --> 13:58.344
He comes in with stuff, <br/>he wants it blown up 400% .

13:58.516 --> 14:00.677
We say, ''We don't do that.'' <br/>He says, ''You gotta.''

14:00.852 --> 14:03.082
And you know what? <br/>We did it.

14:03.254 --> 14:07.088
And now anytime anybody wants <br/>400, we just say, ''Let's Ross it!''

14:07.258 --> 14:10.056
And that's the only color <br/>that comes in.

14:11.229 --> 14:14.721
Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter <br/>for the condom machine?

14:18.336 --> 14:21.772
What are you doing here? l thought <br/>tonight was your big anniversary dinner.

14:21.939 --> 14:26.569
Yeah, a little change of plans. <br/>We're gonna break up instead.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.005
And l can also speak a little French.

14:31.315 --> 14:34.045
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?

14:36.020 --> 14:37.510
Why? What did l say?

14:37.822 --> 14:41.485
Well, you just asked if l wanted <br/>to go to bed with you tonight.

14:43.594 --> 14:44.856
Oh, my God.

14:45.029 --> 14:48.829
No wonder l get such <br/>great service at Cafê Maurice.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.498
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

14:50.701 --> 14:55.638
Hi. Could you please tell Sergei <br/>that l was fascinated...

14:55.807 --> 14:58.674
...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali <br/>said in the New York Times.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.441
You didn't say <br/>''Boutros Boutros-Ghali.''

15:05.183 --> 15:07.413
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

15:09.353 --> 15:10.911
He says he was too.

15:11.088 --> 15:13.113
lnteresting.

15:14.258 --> 15:16.453
So l was wondering--

15:16.627 --> 15:19.391
Before you get all talky again...

15:19.564 --> 15:22.055
...could you also please <br/>tell Sergei...

15:23.534 --> 15:26.002
...that l really like his suit.

15:39.550 --> 15:42.246
He said, ''Thank you.'' <br/>He thinks you look pretty tonight.

15:42.420 --> 15:45.048
''Your hair, golden like the sun.'' <br/>So you're a chef?

15:46.757 --> 15:49.021
l'm also thinking of opening up <br/>my own restaurant.

15:49.260 --> 15:52.718
-Really? <br/>-Could l talk to you behind my menu?

15:55.733 --> 15:59.100
-What are you doing? <br/>-Well, l was having a conversation.

15:59.270 --> 16:01.602
Mischa is so interested in you <br/>that Sergei and l...

16:01.772 --> 16:03.933
...haven't been able to say two words <br/>to each other.

16:04.809 --> 16:07.710
Do you want me to sit here silently <br/>while you three converse?

16:07.879 --> 16:09.574
That would be great. <br/>Thank you.

16:16.888 --> 16:20.016
-Hello? <br/>-Hi. lt's Mark.

16:21.626 --> 16:24.060
-What? ls it my breath? <br/>-No.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.364
Sorry. l just thought <br/>you were somebody else. Hi.

16:27.532 --> 16:30.228
Hi. Look, l was just <br/>gonna leave a message.

16:30.401 --> 16:32.232
lsn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

16:32.403 --> 16:34.268
Well....

16:35.306 --> 16:39.800
-Rach? Are you okay? <br/>-Yeah, l'm fine.

16:40.111 --> 16:41.942
You wanna talk? <br/>I can come over.

16:42.113 --> 16:44.707
No. Really, no. Please. That's okay.

16:44.949 --> 16:47.349
All right. l'm coming, <br/>and l'll bring Chinese food.

16:47.518 --> 16:49.042
Oh, yeah, l'm not hungry.

16:49.220 --> 16:51.711
It's for me.

16:52.290 --> 16:54.315
Okay, bye.

16:57.728 --> 16:59.696
-So, what are you gonna do? <br/>-What can l do?

16:59.864 --> 17:01.991
One person wants to break up, <br/>you break up.

17:02.233 --> 17:05.600
No way. Come on. This is you guys. <br/>Call her and work it out.

17:05.836 --> 17:09.363
Come on. We just had this huge fight. <br/>Don't l have to wait a while?

17:09.540 --> 17:13.670
Hey, this isn't like swimming <br/>after you eat. Pick up the phone!

17:18.349 --> 17:20.783
You know that whole <br/>swimming thing is a myth.

17:20.985 --> 17:23.249
Yeah. Tell that to my uncle Lenny.

17:23.421 --> 17:25.651
Why? What happened to him?

17:25.823 --> 17:28.883
Nothing. He just really <br/>believes in that.

17:30.661 --> 17:33.687
And then we got into this <br/>big, stupid fight.... lt was awful.

17:33.931 --> 17:38.994
l told him he treats me like <br/>a park ranger, something....

17:39.537 --> 17:40.765
And then...

17:41.939 --> 17:44.339
...l told him <br/>l wanted to take a break.

17:44.609 --> 17:47.442
l don't want to take a break.

17:47.612 --> 17:49.136
l'm sorry.

17:50.181 --> 17:53.446
-Egg roll? <br/>-No.

17:54.018 --> 17:57.146
And then l called him, <br/>and he wasn't there.

17:57.321 --> 17:58.948
Well, he's probably just out.

17:59.123 --> 18:02.388
Well, thank you, that's very helpful. <br/>l'm glad you came over.

18:08.199 --> 18:09.325
Hi, it's me.

18:09.734 --> 18:13.192
-Hi. l'm so glad you called. <br/>-Really?

18:13.371 --> 18:16.704
l've been thinking this is crazy. <br/>Don't you think we can work on this?

18:17.842 --> 18:19.400
Hey, what do you wanna drink?

18:19.744 --> 18:20.733
Who's that?

18:22.246 --> 18:23.975
Nobody?

18:24.448 --> 18:27.042
ls it okay if l finish <br/>the apple juice?

18:27.585 --> 18:28.779
ls that Mark?

18:30.688 --> 18:33.987
-Honey, look, he just came over-- <br/>-Yeah, got it!

18:38.562 --> 18:41.622
Hey, dinosaur guy. <br/>Look at you, so sad.

18:41.799 --> 18:44.893
-Come dance. <br/>-That's okay. Thanks.

18:46.370 --> 18:49.237
You don't have to smile. <br/>You just have to dance.

18:49.407 --> 18:52.205
l don't feel like dancing. <br/>l feel like having a drink, okay?

18:52.376 --> 18:55.277
Okay. Hey, two beers.

18:57.181 --> 19:00.082
Okay, now we're <br/>just dancing with each other.

19:07.725 --> 19:09.886
And the vet said it was time.

19:10.127 --> 19:12.118
And so from half a world away...

19:12.396 --> 19:15.058
...while my mother <br/>held the phone to his ear...

19:15.299 --> 19:18.393
...l said goodbye to my dog...

19:18.869 --> 19:20.928
...in seven languages.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.170
-Could l have a tissue? <br/>-Yeah, sure.

19:25.342 --> 19:27.242
l just hope you don't accidentally...

19:27.411 --> 19:30.312
...suck it up through your nose <br/>and choke on it.

19:35.953 --> 19:39.980
Sergei would like to apologize <br/>for my behavior tonight.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.720
Well, tell him, ''Apology accepted.''

19:46.430 --> 19:47.658
He's unbelievable.

19:47.832 --> 19:50.960
For the first time in three years, <br/>someone wants to talk to me.

19:51.135 --> 19:54.935
But do you think he would <br/>let me enjoy that? No!

19:55.239 --> 19:58.834
You silly diplomat. Why don't you <br/>learn some English, Sergei.

20:00.811 --> 20:04.508
Excuse me, but isn't he paying <br/>for your dinner?

20:04.682 --> 20:06.673
Hey, the man's dog just died.

20:24.602 --> 20:26.627
l have just resigned my post.

20:26.837 --> 20:29.465
Would you care to accompany <br/>me to the Rainbow Room?

20:29.640 --> 20:31.403
l have diplomatic coupons.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.042
lt would be my pleasure.

20:36.714 --> 20:39.046
My guy has coupons.

20:40.684 --> 20:43.346
Your guy can't even say ''coupons.''

20:50.694 --> 20:54.357
-Plate. <br/>-Plate! Yes! Plate!

20:54.832 --> 20:56.663
Plate.

20:57.835 --> 21:00.133
See, we don't need them.

21:02.339 --> 21:05.706
-Plate? <br/>-Yeah.

21:14.351 --> 21:16.751
l like this song.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.748
Well, you're practically <br/>dancing already.

21:20.858 --> 21:23.952
-Why don't you just do it over here? <br/>-No.

21:24.128 --> 21:26.323
What, are you married?

21:26.497 --> 21:28.692
Because that's okay.

21:43.247 --> 21:46.080
Be home, be home, be home, <br/>be home, be home, be home.

21:47.952 --> 21:49.977
Be home, be home, be home.

21:52.556 --> 21:54.683
You're not home.

22:05.135 --> 22:06.432
Still no smile?

22:44.008 --> 22:45.270
American.

22:48.445 --> 22:50.436
You know, it's a very hard language.

22:51.348 --> 22:52.610
Let's do it again.

23:00.257 --> 23:01.246
