WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:04.994
Everybody! Central Perk
is proud to present...

00:05.205 --> 00:09.141
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

00:11.711 --> 00:12.700
Thanks.

00:13.179 --> 00:16.637
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

00:16.850 --> 00:21.184
...when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.788
Okay, here we go.

00:26.993 --> 00:29.154
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.376
Oh, great. This is just

00:50.216 --> 00:52.446
The One With The Blackout

01:40.633 --> 01:44.467
This is so cool, you guys.
The entire city's blacked out.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.504
It's all of Manhattan.
They have no idea...

01:47.707 --> 01:49.572
...when it's back on.

01:49.776 --> 01:54.042
-You guys, this is big.
-Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom?

01:54.547 --> 01:56.742
Who will I meet in a blackout?

01:57.851 --> 02:01.116
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

02:01.654 --> 02:05.454
-Can we talk about this later? Okay.
-Can I borrow the phone?

02:05.658 --> 02:09.150
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

02:09.362 --> 02:10.693
What's my number?

02:12.432 --> 02:14.332
I never call me.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.871
Oh, my God! It's her.
It's that Victoria 's Secret model.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.370
Something Goodacre.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.939
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.739
She 's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre. Oh, my God!

02:27.947 --> 02:31.849
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.819
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium.

02:36.356 --> 02:39.985
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

02:41.127 --> 02:45.154
I' m fine. I' m just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

02:45.365 --> 02:49.495
Jill says vestibule,
I'm going with vestibule.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.731
I' m fine. No, l' m not alone.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.032
I don't know, some guy.

02:56.242 --> 03:00.508
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

03:00.713 --> 03:03.409
Jill, I saw you with some guy
last night.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.448
Yes, he was some guy.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.086
Hey, everyone.

03:23.736 --> 03:27.638
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi T ribbiani.

03:30.810 --> 03:35.372
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish.
These are our only candles.

03:35.582 --> 03:36.810
So happy Hanukkah!

03:38.918 --> 03:42.285
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.721
That had to hurt!

03:53.166 --> 03:55.999
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes...

03:56.236 --> 03:59.069
...and you still haven 't said
one word. God!

03:59.272 --> 04:02.867
Do something!
Just make contact. Smile!

04:06.679 --> 04:08.169
There you go.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.146
You 're definitely scaring her.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.859
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.152
Mom.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.159
Mom, you' re tripping!

04:26.699 --> 04:30.191
Dexter's a dog.
The blackout's scaring him.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.767
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too
if you didn't know.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.938
All right, call me back.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.434
-Mothers.
-Yeah.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.616
Attaboy! A word.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.444
That wasn 't so hard.
Mothers. Yeah!

04:46.653 --> 04:49.417
Mothers. Yeah! Perfect.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.221
Don 't smile.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.686
Would you like to call somebody?

04:56.462 --> 04:59.795
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.938
Yeah, thanks.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.244
-Hello?
-It's me.

05:12.445 --> 05:16.472
-It's Chandler. Are you okay?
-Yeah, l' m fine.

05:16.683 --> 05:20.983
I' m stuck in an ATM vestibule...

05:21.954 --> 05:25.014
...with Jill Goodacre.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.056
-What?
-l' m stuck...

05:29.696 --> 05:32.256
...in an ATM vestibule...

05:32.465 --> 05:34.626
...with Jill Goodacre.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.767
I have no idea what you said.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.835
Put Joey on the phone.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.574
-What's up, man?
-l' m stuck...

05:46.446 --> 05:48.937
...in an ATM vestibule...

05:49.582 --> 05:52.517
...with Jill Goodacre!

05:53.519 --> 05:54.611
Oh, my God!

05:54.921 --> 05:58.220
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre!

06:00.259 --> 06:01.453
Chandler, listen.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.856
Like that thought
never entered my mind.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.895
-Okay.
-Somebody.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.136
-I'll go. I'll go.
-Okay.

06:15.341 --> 06:19.107
Senior year of college,
on a pool table.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.738
-Pool table?
-That's my sister.

06:24.016 --> 06:27.611
Okay, my weirdest place
would have to be...

06:27.820 --> 06:32.621
...the women's room of the New York
City Public Library.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.760
Oh, my God! What were you
doing in a library?

06:37.897 --> 06:41.799
-Pheebs, what about you?
-Oh, Milwaukee.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.405
It's a really weird place.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.768
Ross?

06:53.913 --> 06:57.371
Disneyland, 1 989.
" It's a small world after all. "

06:59.719 --> 07:00.845
No way.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.577
The ride broke down...

07:02.789 --> 07:08.056
...so Carol and I went behind
those mechanical Dutch children.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.595
We were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.566
Let's see, that leaves....

07:17.770 --> 07:20.466
-Rachel?
-Come on, I already went.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.106
-You did not go.
-I did.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.342
T ell us. Come on.

07:24.544 --> 07:29.777
All right, the weirdest place
would have to be...

07:31.951 --> 07:34.112
...the foot of the bed.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.115
-Step back!
-We have a winner!

07:46.899 --> 07:51.097
This must be what the fridge
looks like with the door closed.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.328
Spooky.

07:54.207 --> 07:58.701
Anybody hungry?
We got a Klondike...soup.

07:59.412 --> 08:03.314
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

08:03.516 --> 08:07.077
Where you have to have somebody
even in a theme park.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.614
It was the only thing to do
that didn't have a line.

08:15.461 --> 08:19.397
Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature golf course.

08:19.599 --> 08:20.657
-Come on.
-No.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.427
He said we held up
the people behind us.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.465
You didn't marry him because...?

08:28.407 --> 08:31.808
Do you think there are people
that go through life...

08:32.011 --> 08:34.605
... never having that kind of...?

08:34.814 --> 08:36.406
-Probably.
-Really?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.983
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.676
-Yeah, right.
-lt is.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.379
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

08:44.824 --> 08:49.659
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and....

08:49.862 --> 08:51.887
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

08:57.737 --> 09:01.696
For those people who miss out
on that passion thing...

09:01.908 --> 09:03.375
...there's other stuff.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.674
-Okay.
-But I don't think that'll be you.

09:09.715 --> 09:13.173
-You don't?
-See, I see...

09:13.386 --> 09:16.583
-... big passion in your future.
-Really?

09:17.490 --> 09:18.855
-You do?
-I do.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.256
Ross, you' re so great.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.229
It's never gonna happen.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.306
-What?
-You and Rachel.

09:48.454 --> 09:51.389
What? Me and Ra?

09:52.625 --> 09:53.751
Why not?

09:55.895 --> 09:58.386
You waited too long
to make your move...

09:58.598 --> 10:01.533
...and now you' re
in the "friend zone. "

10:02.768 --> 10:06.898
-l' m not in the zone.
-No, Ross. You' re mayor of the zone.

10:08.741 --> 10:13.144
Look, l' m taking my time, all right?
I' m laying the groundwork.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.213
Every day I get
a little bit closer to

10:16.415 --> 10:17.575
Priesthood!

10:19.385 --> 10:23.378
I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

10:23.589 --> 10:26.990
She just ran her fingers
through my hair.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.788
-Were you missing that interaction?
-No, no, no.

10:30.997 --> 10:34.865
This is running fingers
through your hair, okay?

10:35.067 --> 10:38.264
Now this is a tousle.

10:39.472 --> 10:44.409
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll be in the zone forever.

10:44.610 --> 10:48.444
I will, I will.
I'm waiting for the right moment.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.511
What?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.679
-What, now?
-Yeah.

10:56.289 --> 11:00.248
What's messing you up?
The wine? The moonlight?

11:00.761 --> 11:04.162
You gotta go up to her and say,
" Look, Rachel, l"

11:06.266 --> 11:08.029
-What?
-We' re shushing...

11:08.935 --> 11:11.733
... because we' re trying
to hear something.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.704
-What? What?
-Don't you hear that?

11:21.048 --> 11:22.072
See?

11:27.087 --> 11:29.555
-Would you like gum?
-ls it sugarless?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.654
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then no, thanks.

11:34.861 --> 11:35.850
What was that?

11:38.331 --> 11:42.392
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

11:42.602 --> 11:47.062
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it!

11:48.942 --> 11:52.241
New York City has no power

11:52.446 --> 11:56.075
And the milk is getting sour

11:56.450 --> 11:59.647
But to me it is not scary

11:59.853 --> 12:04.051
Because I stay away from dairy

12:13.200 --> 12:14.792
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.366
-I'll do it.
-Want help?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.731
You come out, you' re a dead man.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.338
-Good luck, man.
-Thanks.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.748
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:33.887 --> 12:37.345
Where you going?
You can't go out there.

12:37.557 --> 12:41.425
-Why not?
-Because of the reason.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.293
-That would be?
-I can't tell you.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.627
Joey, what's going on?

12:48.835 --> 12:53.397
You gotta promise you'll
never tell Ross that I told you.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.440
-What?
-He's planning your birthday party.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.773
-Oh, my God! I love him!
-You better act surprised.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.314
-About what?
-My surprise party.

13:04.518 --> 13:08.511
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.680
He didn't tell me.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.226
Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.794
This is typical.
I'm always the last to know.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.966
You are not. We tell you stuff.

13:20.167 --> 13:25.434
I was the last one to know when
Chandler got bit by the peacock.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.536
I was the last to know
you had a crush on Joey.

13:29.743 --> 13:30.801
What?

13:31.611 --> 13:34.307
Looks like I was second to last.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.078
You had a crush on me?

13:41.888 --> 13:46.587
All right. It wasn't a crush,
it was a dent.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.227
Big dent?

13:49.429 --> 13:54.628
You were moving your furniture.
I thought you had nice arms.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.767
Nice arms, huh?

13:59.339 --> 14:02.467
Hey, Mon, l' m moving the chair.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.008
Do anything for you?

14:08.381 --> 14:12.613
With all the lights out
you can actually see the stars.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.582
It's so nice.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.888
I have a question.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.462
Actually, it's not
so much a question.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.190
It's more
of a general wondering....

14:29.102 --> 14:30.262
ment.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.970
-Okay.
-Okay. Here it goes.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.440
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to....

14:42.582 --> 14:46.985
-Yes, that's right.
-Look at that little kitty!

14:47.721 --> 14:48.949
What?

14:50.523 --> 14:55.324
Top of the world
Looking down on creation

14:55.528 --> 14:59.692
And the only explanation I can find

15:01.434 --> 15:07.395
Is the love that I found
Ever since you 've been around

15:21.688 --> 15:24.657
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.926
-Ow!
-Sorry, that was wax.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.599
Poor little T ooty's scared.
We should find his owner.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.202
Why not put poor T ooty in the hall?

15:39.306 --> 15:42.036
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.641
Yeah?

15:46.212 --> 15:49.204
Damage control. Get back to the gum.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.350
Gum would be perfection.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.579
Gum would be perfection?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.216
Gum would be perfection.

15:58.425 --> 16:02.122
Could've said,
"Gum would be nice. " But, no.

16:02.329 --> 16:06.060
For me, gum is perfection.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.796
I loathe myself!

16:12.038 --> 16:15.337
Oh, no, they' re nuns.
They hate all living things.

16:21.247 --> 16:25.650
Hi. We just found this cat,
and we' re looking for the owner.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.252
Yeah, it's mine.

16:29.689 --> 16:34.285
-He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
-It's my cat. Give me my cat.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.892
-Wait a minute. What's his name?
-Bob Buttons.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.895
-Bob Buttons?
-Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.137
You are a very bad man!

16:49.909 --> 16:51.536
You owe me a cat.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.176
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.182
Here, kitty, kitty.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.514
Where did you go, little kitty?

17:04.391 --> 17:07.827
IKitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.499
-Hi.
-Buona sera.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.300
Wow!

17:22.709 --> 17:25.701
Mon, wanna go for a ride
in my racecar?

17:25.912 --> 17:27.846
I'll bring my arms.

17:28.615 --> 17:32.073
We can bring my wheelbarrow
for your teeth!

17:34.788 --> 17:36.779
Come on, lucky sixes!

17:37.624 --> 17:40.218
Everybody, this is Paolo.

17:40.927 --> 17:45.159
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Monica...

17:45.365 --> 17:47.196
-Hi.
-...and Joey...

17:47.400 --> 17:50.335
-Hi.
-...and Ross.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.834
Hi.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.639
He doesn't speak much English.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.778
Monopoly!

18:05.485 --> 18:06.952
Look at that!

18:08.154 --> 18:11.646
So, where did Paolo come from?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.521
Italy, I think.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.390
No, I mean tonight.
Suddenly, into our lives.

18:19.099 --> 18:23.832
That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.
Isn't that funny?

18:25.405 --> 18:29.000
That is funny.
And Rachel keeps touching him.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.805
I looked all over and couldn't find
the kitty anywhere.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.449
I found him. It was Paolo's cat.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.183
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.657
And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.193
Paolo, this is Phoebe.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.295
You betcha!

19:00.206 --> 19:03.175
All right. Okay. What next?

19:03.776 --> 19:06.643
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.679
It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.282
Here we go.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.324
Nice going, imp!

19:25.131 --> 19:27.531
It's okay. All I need to do...

19:27.734 --> 19:32.330
...is reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

19:33.907 --> 19:37.934
Good save!
We 're back on track and I'm...

19:38.144 --> 19:41.238
... chewing someone else 's gum.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.978
This is not my gum!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19:46.819 --> 19:48.616
And now you 're choking.

19:50.924 --> 19:51.913
You all right?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.961
My God! You' re choking!

20:00.967 --> 20:03.936
-Better?
-Yes.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.764
Thank you. That was....

20:06.472 --> 20:09.134
-That was....
-Perfection?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.854
That was no tousle.

20:37.737 --> 20:42.640
-What'd he say that was so funny?
-I have absolutely no idea.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.742
That's classic.

20:44.944 --> 20:49.005
My God, you guys! What am I doing?
This is so un-me!

20:49.215 --> 20:51.376
If you want, I'll do it.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.715
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.123
But I won't.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.758
The first time he smiled at me...

21:01.961 --> 21:05.863
...those seconds were more exciting
than weeks with Barry.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.464
Did you rent mopeds?

21:09.602 --> 21:14.005
Because I've heard
Oh, it's not about that right now.

21:14.340 --> 21:18.208
I know it's superficial,
and we have nothing in common...

21:18.411 --> 21:22.677
...and we don't even speak
the same language, but, God!

21:27.453 --> 21:30.115
-Paolo, hi.
-Ross.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.312
Listen....

21:35.261 --> 21:38.424
Listen, something you should know.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.897
Rachel and I are....

21:42.368 --> 21:44.893
We' re kind of a thing.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.001
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.640
-You have the sex?
-No.

21:52.545 --> 21:57.573
No, technically the sex
is not being had. But that's....

21:58.318 --> 22:00.752
But that's not the point.

22:00.953 --> 22:05.583
The point is that
Rachel and I should be....

22:05.958 --> 22:09.018
Well, Rachel and l
should be together.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.219
And if you get in the

22:11.431 --> 22:13.262
-ln bed
-No.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.695
No, not where I was going.

22:16.903 --> 22:21.272
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

22:21.474 --> 22:25.069
...then I would be, well, very sad.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.308
So, do you...?

22:33.753 --> 22:38.213
-So you do know a little English?
-Little.

22:38.424 --> 22:41.882
-Do you know the word "crap-weasel "?
-No.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.626
That's funny.
You are a huge crap-weasel.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.604
We've been doing this
for an hour. It's easy.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.172
Ready?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.604
Okay? Now try it.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.180
You gotta whip it.

23:10.123 --> 23:13.854
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

23:14.060 --> 23:18.360
T en, nine, eight, seven...

23:18.564 --> 23:23.365
... minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48....

23:24.036 --> 23:26.004
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.503
IKind of spooky without any lights.

23:37.717 --> 23:40.413
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

23:52.899 --> 23:56.858
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

23:57.069 --> 23:59.833
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.641
-This has been fun.
-Yes.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.977
Thanks for letting me
use your phone...

24:13.953 --> 24:15.614
...and for saving my life.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.817
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
I had a great blackout.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.188
See you.

24:38.544 --> 24:42.537
Hi, l' m account number 71 43457.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.807
I don't know if you got that...

24:45.017 --> 24:48.214
... but I would really
like a copy of the tape.
