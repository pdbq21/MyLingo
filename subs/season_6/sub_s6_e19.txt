WEBVTT

00:06.072 --> 00:08.666
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.674
All right.

00:14.414 --> 00:15.904
Damn fridge!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.978
- Hi, Joey. How you doing?
- Great...

00:20.720 --> 00:22.210
roomie.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.088
- I guess we are roommates.
- I know.

00:25.325 --> 00:28.624
Now that you bring it up,
our fridge is broken.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.159
We need a new one.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.924
I checked and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.370
I'm not paying for that.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.095
I'm just here while they fix my place.

00:40.306 --> 00:44.936
Look, Rach, my parents bought this
fridge just after I was born. Okay?

00:45.178 --> 00:49.672
I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

00:51.684 --> 00:53.777
What does that tell you?

00:54.054 --> 00:57.581
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

00:59.893 --> 01:03.294
You know the ATM
only lets you take out 300, so...

01:03.963 --> 01:06.329
I'll take a check for the rest.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.023
You're joking, right?

01:09.636 --> 01:12.571
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.571
Thank God, you're pretty.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.206
The One With Joey's Fridge

01:59.319 --> 02:02.220
Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys?

02:02.422 --> 02:05.391
Of course.
My good friend Joey over here.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.958
I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

02:14.033 --> 02:17.264
There's a charity ball
and Ralph Lauren has a table...

02:17.470 --> 02:18.596
so I have to go.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.932
- What charity?
- I don't know.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.633
Something, either trees or disease...

02:25.311 --> 02:26.903
Ralph mumbles a lot.

02:27.914 --> 02:31.975
- He mumbles when you're not attentive?
- Yeah. It's weird.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.150
But I need to find a date.

02:35.355 --> 02:36.879
What kind of date?

02:37.090 --> 02:40.924
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.994
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.126
So close.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.531
- Hey, everybody!
- Hi, there.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.396
- This is Elizabeth.
- Hi, Elizabeth.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.468
I'm the student.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.236
Isn't she cute? Nope.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.239
Weren't you guys supposed to...

03:02.448 --> 03:04.507
not be seen together?

03:04.784 --> 03:05.773
We aren't.

03:05.985 --> 03:10.046
We just happen
to have run into each other here.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.746
This is...

03:13.193 --> 03:15.661
Oh, sly!

03:16.529 --> 03:19.123
I wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.765
- See you later?
- Okay.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.730
- Bye, Ross.
- Bye. See you.

03:23.203 --> 03:27.071
- Didn't mean to run into you, sir.
- That's quite all right, ma'am.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.672
Bye.

03:29.142 --> 03:33.010
Why is she leaving? Is it a
school night and she has homework?

03:33.513 --> 03:37.574
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.446
Tell her good luck with that.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.346
Anyone else? Bring them on.

03:44.123 --> 03:47.217
- When's her birthday?
- I don't know. Why?

03:47.493 --> 03:51.623
It's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.493
- I like Elizabeth.
- Well, thanks.

03:55.702 --> 04:00.196
I like her so much, tell her
I want my cookies early this year.

04:00.607 --> 04:04.043
A box of Thin Mints
and some Tagalongs.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.838
Give him a break.
Ross, how's it going with her?

04:08.047 --> 04:09.412
It's been great.

04:09.716 --> 04:14.619
She's 20, so she's not too serious,
which is perfect for me now.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.822
That's great.
Seriously, she seems nice.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.958
I know you guys like
to give me a hard time...

04:21.160 --> 04:22.718
but it means a lot to me.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.762
- Just knowing..
- Okay, I got a good one.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.627
What is she, like, 12?

04:40.980 --> 04:43.710
Chandler, do we talk about
our relationship enough?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.651
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?

04:48.888 --> 04:50.082
Okay.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.123
I thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.294
That's so funny.
We found someone too.

04:55.561 --> 04:59.429
Good. She'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.958
- Why would our guy be a weirdo?
- Because that's just your taste.

05:05.204 --> 05:08.264
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.498
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.702
My guy is a lawyer,
who does volunteer work.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.312
And he has one of these.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.950
A face ass?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.616
A chin dimple.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.045
Well, you know, our guy works
with Chandler.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.316
He's really nice and smart,
and he's a great dresser.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.789
- Have you seen your guy's body?
- No. Our guy's just a floating head.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.631
Well, my guy is spectacular.
He's a massage client.

05:35.835 --> 05:40.568
And one time, when he was on the table,
I looked at it. And I mean all of it.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.102
- You're not supposed to look.
- Like there are police for that.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.509
You look? You massaged me.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.512
I know.

05:52.151 --> 05:56.520
Fine. Your guy may have a great body,
but our guy is really funny.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.816
Chandler funny?

05:59.425 --> 06:01.689
- Our guy's a great dancer.
- My guy's well-read.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.191
- Our guy has great hair.
- My guy has great teeth.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.762
Our guy smells incredible.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.036
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

06:19.746 --> 06:22.442
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.877
The fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.284
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.419
What was in that brown jar?

06:33.626 --> 06:36.925
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.026
So anyway, how do you want to pay me?

06:41.968 --> 06:45.233
Is this a service you're providing me?

06:45.605 --> 06:49.473
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.209
Our new fridge?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.777
- I don't live here anymore.
- So what?

06:53.980 --> 06:57.381
Look, okay, suppose we were
a divorced couple.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.375
And I got custody of the kid. Right?

07:00.586 --> 07:04.613
Now suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.361
Okay.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.487
Give me $400!

07:13.766 --> 07:16.326
Thank God, you're pretty.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.810
Professor Geller?

07:26.412 --> 07:28.403
Oh, a student I don't know.

07:30.983 --> 07:33.543
I was wondering if I
could talk to you for a moment?

07:33.753 --> 07:36.244
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.981
Making out in your office.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.721
Of course. Why don't we go inside.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.830
- What?
- Doorknob.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.473
Sorry.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.370
I actually do need to talk to you.

07:58.578 --> 07:59.567
What about?

07:59.879 --> 08:02.211
- Spring vacation?
- Spring vacation?

08:02.515 --> 08:05.780
Yeah, we have time off, and
a lot of people are going on trips..

08:06.085 --> 08:10.044
- Professor Geller.
- Yes, Professor Friesenstinlender.

08:10.623 --> 08:13.285
I'll be with you in one moment.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.361
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.

08:21.801 --> 08:26.704
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.568
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this.

08:29.775 --> 08:33.006
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her the truth, tell her you're not ready.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.847
I could do that.

08:37.049 --> 08:41.782
- What if she gets upset?
- Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

08:43.589 --> 08:46.251
Or you could just, you know, you...

08:52.265 --> 08:54.859
What the hell are you doing?

08:55.935 --> 09:00.372
What the hell am I doing?
You just broke my fridge!

09:01.407 --> 09:02.601
What? How do..?

09:02.808 --> 09:04.776
How do you know it's even broken?

09:05.311 --> 09:08.508
You think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

09:09.148 --> 09:10.775
Excuse me!

09:11.717 --> 09:13.514
Well, what do you know?

09:13.719 --> 09:14.981
Broken!

09:15.855 --> 09:17.720
That'll be $400.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.858
Joey, I saw you push him.

09:23.462 --> 09:24.861
You pushed him.

09:27.300 --> 09:31.794
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.339
Remember I told you about our fridge?

09:37.543 --> 09:40.979
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.239
Do not give him any money!

09:43.449 --> 09:47.283
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!

09:54.961 --> 09:59.295
- You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
- Yes. Please come in.

10:04.236 --> 10:07.171
- Doorknob?
- Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

10:08.507 --> 10:11.772
I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.343
Good.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.972
Look, I...

10:21.621 --> 10:24.181
Look, I'm having
a great time with you.

10:24.390 --> 10:29.692
And I just don't want us to move too
fast or put too much pressure on us.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.154
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.765
It's too soon.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.428
Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

10:39.005 --> 10:44.739
I just wanted to tell you that I'm
going to Florida for a couple weeks.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.473
No.

10:49.682 --> 10:53.379
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.514
What I meant was..

10:55.721 --> 10:57.018
You are so adorable.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.192
That. Let's talk about that.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.891
How did it go with Elizabeth?

11:07.233 --> 11:11.465
Fine. Just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.266
She just wanted to let me know she's
going to Florida for a spring vacation.

11:15.474 --> 11:18.739
Wait a minute. Is she going for
spring vacation or spring break? Wahoo!

11:21.547 --> 11:22.707
What's the difference?

11:23.049 --> 11:26.143
Spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.014
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.817
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.018
- What did you do on yours?
- I went to Egypt with my dad.

11:38.998 --> 11:43.526
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo!"

11:44.370 --> 11:49.137
I think Elizabeth is a little more
serious than: "Spring break, wahoo!"

11:49.742 --> 11:51.869
Come on, she's taking my class.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.343
- And slept with the professor.
- I'm gonna call her.

11:58.951 --> 12:02.011
You guys,
I want you to meet Sebastian.

12:02.588 --> 12:08.288
We met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.959
What? I read that.

12:12.031 --> 12:15.626
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- Yes. Thank you.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.467
- Rachel, what the hell is this?
- What?

12:21.741 --> 12:25.575
You ask us to find a guy, and you come
traipsing in here with a guy of your own?

12:25.878 --> 12:26.867
You found me a guy?

12:27.079 --> 12:30.708
Yes. We found you a really cute,
funny guy from Chandler's work.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.317
Yeah, and I found you one too,
who is not a weirdo.

12:35.788 --> 12:39.349
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

12:39.558 --> 12:41.287
but I'm gonna take Sebastian.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.395
Are you sure?
Our guy smells incredible.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.031
Would you stop it with that already?

12:47.533 --> 12:50.127
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.333
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

12:54.807 --> 12:56.832
- Not really. Why?
- No reason.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.307
I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

13:01.647 --> 13:02.978
Are you funny?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.750
- Excuse me?
- What are you guys doing?

13:07.153 --> 13:09.314
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

13:10.823 --> 13:13.121
I just wanted to have coffee
with Rachel.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.589
Well, so do a lot of people.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.520
- Actually, I gotta get going.
- But you..

13:20.132 --> 13:23.124
- Give me a call sometime.
- You didn't give me your phone number.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.996
Okay, see you later.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.531
Turns out he is kind of funny.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.700
I cannot believe you guys!

13:32.912 --> 13:35.938
He was really nice,
and he just left because of you!

13:36.382 --> 13:39.180
Yeah, but "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

13:40.553 --> 13:44.216
You know what I noticed, Rachel?
He scares easy.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.721
Is that the kind of guy you wanna take
to a ball?

13:46.926 --> 13:48.894
"Hey, Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

13:49.395 --> 13:50.885
"Okay. I gotta go. "

13:52.431 --> 13:54.763
Stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.629
That is a very
insensitive thing to do.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.135
Let us make it up to you.
We have two really great guys for you.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.097
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

14:03.309 --> 14:08.246
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.309
- All right.
- So you will meet our guys?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.541
Yes.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.612
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.789
Our guy is perfect.

14:18.224 --> 14:23.127
Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough for herself.

14:23.829 --> 14:26.127
There you are!
You broke my fridge.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.799
You owe me $400.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.269
- Okay, sure.
- Really?

14:32.771 --> 14:36.673
Technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

14:36.876 --> 14:39.845
on your last 10 auditions.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.880
Call it even?

14:46.652 --> 14:48.313
Okay.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.717
There you are.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.424
What did Elizabeth say?

14:53.926 --> 14:58.124
Turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, wahoo. "

14:58.330 --> 15:03.097
That means wet T-shirt contests, guys
doing shots off of girls' bodies...

15:03.302 --> 15:04.394
waking up with strangers.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.935
She is gonna have a great time!

15:08.974 --> 15:11.306
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

15:12.011 --> 15:15.879
- You know the hotels?
- I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!

15:16.081 --> 15:18.777
In 1981, you were 13.

15:19.318 --> 15:22.253
So? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
Had a blast.

15:22.454 --> 15:26.356
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.485
Okay, she can't go.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.926
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.158
- What am I supposed to do?
- You just have to be cool with it.

15:37.369 --> 15:40.236
What if she goes down there and sleeps
with a bunch of guys?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.164
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.682
I'm sorry, this is very serious.
And you know what, Ross?

15:50.849 --> 15:54.683
You like her, she likes you,
everything's gonna be fine.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.253
You're right.
I'm probably overreacting.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.119
It's just she's staying at
this party hotel on the beach...

16:00.292 --> 16:02.817
with a huge pool and free drinks
with every meal.

16:02.995 --> 16:07.523
If she's got enough money for that, she
can certainly pat for the fridge she broke.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.597
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.710
I've been working
so hard this semester.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.403
I really need to go crazy,
blow off some steam.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.411
Sure.

16:25.951 --> 16:29.944
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet, but...

16:30.522 --> 16:33.355
I know a great way
to blow off steam.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.426
- What?
- Are you into crafts at all?

16:38.364 --> 16:39.592
Ross, are you okay?

16:40.065 --> 16:41.896
Yeah. Of course I'm okay.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.126
I'm just being supportive.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.203
Supportive of you
and this whole trip...

16:47.406 --> 16:50.273
and what's this?

16:52.378 --> 16:53.743
It's a bathing suit?

16:54.179 --> 16:56.079
To wear in front of people?

16:57.383 --> 16:58.645
Is that supportive?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.115
Is this?

17:03.088 --> 17:04.316
Okay, good.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.479
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.650
We're so glad you decided to
meet our guy. You'll like him so much.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.693
- When do you want to meet him?
- I don't know.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.765
- I don't work late tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night is good.

17:15.968 --> 17:20.564
But why put off something till
tomorrow that you could do it right now?

17:20.773 --> 17:23.071
- Eldad, come here!
- What?

17:23.642 --> 17:25.940
- This is Rachel.
- How are you?

17:26.145 --> 17:28.579
A little blindsided but good.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.510
Eldad, sit down. Move over now.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.512
There you go. There you are.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.286
Okay, we can take a hint!

17:40.159 --> 17:42.389
What? What are you doing here?

17:42.594 --> 17:43.788
This is Patrick.

17:43.962 --> 17:44.951
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.724
You're too late because
she's already with our guy.

17:47.933 --> 17:52.302
You're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.598
Come on.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.842
Rachel? This is Patrick.

17:58.944 --> 17:59.968
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.010
This is the guy I was telling you about.

18:02.214 --> 18:06.150
This suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.447
Okay.

18:08.787 --> 18:12.723
But, Phoebe, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.517
Okay. That's okay. Have a seat.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.621
- You can't do that!
- I should go.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.856
Sit down, we're winning.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.658
Maybe I should go.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.803
No. Have a seat!

18:26.004 --> 18:28.700
Rachel, you haven't touched
Eldad's hair.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.974
- He has the softest hair. Touch it.
- I'm good.

18:32.177 --> 18:36.614
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.817
This isn't really worth the free massage.

18:41.019 --> 18:43.044
- That's right. Bye-bye.
- No.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.349
Eldad is much more cooperative,
and he can dance.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.150
You dance for Rachel.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.558
Don't dance for me. Please!

18:51.196 --> 18:53.164
What is the matter with you?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.433
Yeah, let's talk it out.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.030
Am I the only one that this is
embarrassing for?

18:59.238 --> 19:01.069
I'm a little embarrassed.

19:03.208 --> 19:07.440
I'll tell you who should
be embarrassed. It's you guys.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.046
I do not need you
to get me a date.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.013
- Why did she ask us to..?
- I am still talking!

19:13.218 --> 19:16.016
Then you chase away
the one guy I actually liked.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.782
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

19:20.025 --> 19:22.016
all the cash.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.354
And you really do have very soft hair.

19:25.564 --> 19:30.661
But I'd much rather go to the ball by
myself than go through any more of this.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.097
Goodbye.

19:34.439 --> 19:38.000
Now, do you use some sort of
special conditioner on that hair?

19:38.210 --> 19:39.438
Papaya extract.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.873
Thank you.

19:46.251 --> 19:49.015
So have a great time down there.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.177
- I will.
- Yeah.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.190
- Did you pack that bathing suit?
- Yeah.

19:53.392 --> 19:57.021
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while.

19:59.898 --> 20:01.456
Anyway.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.831
I am worried about that suit.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.006
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.402
I'm concerned about your health.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.175
Sun exposure.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.676
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.610
- It's SPF 30.
- All right.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.842
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually 30.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.420
Sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4 and...

20:24.623 --> 20:26.853
more often than not, it's just milk.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.427
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.057
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.426
I really like you.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.062
I like how things are going between us.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.498
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.539
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.676
Okay. Cool.

20:46.378 --> 20:47.572
Here they are!

21:00.359 --> 21:01.656
Call me!

21:06.732 --> 21:09.200
Sorry for pushing those guys on you.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.301
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

21:12.504 --> 21:16.702
The charity was a big success, and they
raised a lot of money and awareness.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.741
So, what was it for anyway?

21:20.512 --> 21:22.503
I wanna say a disease.

21:26.151 --> 21:30.349
I just got this really weird message
from Ross. He said to turn on MTV.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.961
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!

21:48.307 --> 21:50.070
Professor Geller.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.146
To be 13 again...
