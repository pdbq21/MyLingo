WEBVTT

00:05.076 --> 00:06.670
-Where's Mon?
-She's at home...

00:06.847 --> 00:09.717
...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.

00:09.919 --> 00:12.082
-You're not helping?
-l tried...

00:12.257 --> 00:16.163
...but apparently singing ''l Will Survive''
in a helium voice, not helping.

00:18.604 --> 00:20.631
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

00:23.346 --> 00:25.943
Don't say that loud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

00:28.657 --> 00:30.820
Good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

00:30.995 --> 00:35.994
-This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.
-Hi.

00:36.172 --> 00:38.643
Somebody's getting a little fussy.

00:38.844 --> 00:42.283
You're damn right l am. l've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

00:43.486 --> 00:45.821
Okay. You know what,
l'm just gonna take her outside.

00:45.991 --> 00:48.325
-No, you stay. l'll do it.
-Okay. Thank you.

00:48.496 --> 00:51.901
-Nice to meet you guys.
-Yeah, you too.

00:52.538 --> 00:54.735
-Wow, Molly's just great.
-Yeah.

00:54.943 --> 00:57.938
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

00:58.416 --> 01:01.445
-What? You really think she's hot?
-Are you kidding?

01:01.623 --> 01:04.959
lf l wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.395
Joey?

01:08.604 --> 01:10.402
How do you think she's doing?

01:12.578 --> 01:15.048
Am l the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

01:15.985 --> 01:19.823
-l mean, she's not unattractive, but...
-Right.

01:19.993 --> 01:22.429
...but hot?

01:22.865 --> 01:24.664
Thank you.

01:26.940 --> 01:28.238
Now that Rachel's gone?

01:28.442 --> 01:30.970
So hot, l cried myself to sleep
last night.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.280
Hey, Mike,
what's the capital of Peru?

02:25.490 --> 02:28.087
-Lima.
-No.

02:30.099 --> 02:33.071
lt starts with a V
and ends with an X.

02:33.239 --> 02:37.111
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.

02:37.648 --> 02:41.018
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is ''Vtox.''

02:43.392 --> 02:44.725
-Oh, God!
-What?

02:44.896 --> 02:47.162
Okay. l don't want to freak you out
or anything...

02:47.334 --> 02:49.236
...but l just saw a rat
in your cupboard.

02:49.438 --> 02:51.909
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

02:53.747 --> 02:55.580
Well, he's your pet rat?

02:55.784 --> 02:58.414
Well, not so much a pet as, you know,
an occasional visitor...

02:58.590 --> 03:04.056
...who l put food out for.
Kind of like Santa.

03:04.802 --> 03:08.503
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.

03:08.844 --> 03:11.782
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're unsanitary.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.945
l mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.

03:15.156 --> 03:16.682
-What are those?
-l don't know...

03:16.860 --> 03:19.330
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.

03:19.498 --> 03:22.026
-You have to get rid of it.
-Okay, fine.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.504
lf it means that much to you,
l'll get rid of Bob.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.371
Thank you.

03:26.546 --> 03:30.315
lt's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.735
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:39.906 --> 03:42.639
Gavin, l just want to say
thank you again...

03:42.845 --> 03:45.840
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.885
l really owe you an apology.

03:48.189 --> 03:50.922
-For what?
-When we first met, you know...

03:51.094 --> 03:54.590
...l thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

03:54.869 --> 03:57.465
ls this your first apology?

03:57.675 --> 04:00.909
No, l just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

04:01.081 --> 04:05.989
And l think you're a really good guy.
And l'm sorry that l misjudged you.

04:06.225 --> 04:08.560
-Morning.
-Hello.

04:08.730 --> 04:11.896
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.976
l am just really, really happy--

04:16.980 --> 04:20.009
l'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...

04:20.219 --> 04:22.986
...so l'll just wait till it's finished.

04:23.459 --> 04:25.429
-What?
-l was giving you an apology...

04:25.597 --> 04:27.590
...and you were totally
checking her out.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.764
l wasn't. l'm in fashion.
l was looking at her skirt.

04:31.943 --> 04:36.885
Or was it pants? l didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.

04:37.487 --> 04:40.015
Wow, you are really....
You're really a creep.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.321
What do you care
if l was looking at her?

04:42.497 --> 04:43.830
Are you jealous?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.697
Oh, yeah. l'm jealous.

04:45.871 --> 04:49.207
''Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass.''

04:50.514 --> 04:53.007
Stop looking at my ass!

04:53.185 --> 04:55.918
l mean, l just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

04:56.091 --> 04:59.495
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

04:59.699 --> 05:03.194
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?

05:03.372 --> 05:06.607
That is totally different
for two reasons.

05:06.813 --> 05:10.252
One: l didn't know
that you knew that.

05:11.556 --> 05:15.188
And two: l wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

05:15.363 --> 05:19.828
We had a.... We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.

05:21.609 --> 05:23.339
What was Tag's last name?

05:23.546 --> 05:25.242
lt was....

05:27.053 --> 05:28.920
Oh, my God.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.621
He didn't-- He didn't--
He didn't have a last name.

05:32.798 --> 05:38.469
lt was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...

05:38.877 --> 05:41.313
...you know, Moses.

05:42.785 --> 05:45.187
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.

05:45.423 --> 05:48.418
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.

05:48.596 --> 05:51.362
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

05:51.536 --> 05:54.336
-Tag's last name was Morgan!
-lt was Jones.

05:54.642 --> 05:57.169
What are you, his boyfriend?

06:01.288 --> 06:05.194
-Man, l wish l had a nanny like you.
-You mean when you were a baby?

06:05.564 --> 06:07.830
Sure.

06:10.206 --> 06:11.835
Would you stop staring at her?

06:12.745 --> 06:14.544
l wasn't staring.

06:14.715 --> 06:17.151
l was leering.

06:17.688 --> 06:19.555
What's the big deal with her?

06:19.725 --> 06:22.822
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

06:23.031 --> 06:26.333
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

06:26.506 --> 06:29.102
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

06:29.277 --> 06:32.078
Me, l like to have to work
to find someone attractive.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.083
Makes me feel like l earned it.

06:35.256 --> 06:37.385
Looks like Joey's doing all right
with her.

06:37.795 --> 06:40.027
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

06:40.199 --> 06:43.296
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

06:44.608 --> 06:48.103
-l'm gonna take her to the apartment.
-Okay. l'll be home right after work.

06:48.382 --> 06:50.876
-Okay.
-Okay, bye, Emma.

06:51.087 --> 06:54.253
l love you.

06:54.628 --> 06:55.994
-Bye.
-Bye.

06:56.164 --> 06:58.635
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.

06:58.803 --> 07:01.171
lt's not so good.

07:01.441 --> 07:03.605
l think it's sweet.

07:03.813 --> 07:05.942
Bye, Emma!

07:07.788 --> 07:12.787
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, l would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.

07:12.998 --> 07:16.027
-Why not?
-lt took months to find a good nanny.

07:16.204 --> 07:20.076
And l wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

07:20.279 --> 07:22.306
So you think l'm just
gonna sleep with her...

07:22.483 --> 07:25.786
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?

07:25.957 --> 07:28.086
Yeah, that sounds about right.

07:28.963 --> 07:31.297
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there.

07:31.468 --> 07:36.410
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.

07:36.646 --> 07:39.743
Oh, man! What'd you have to go
and say that for?

07:39.919 --> 07:43.654
Now that you told me l can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

07:44.427 --> 07:47.058
-What are you, a child?
-Yes!

07:47.668 --> 07:50.731
lt's true.
He's like a little boy, like Ben.

07:50.907 --> 07:55.371
Just think of him
as a really, really, really horny Ben.

07:57.386 --> 07:58.514
No!

08:00.660 --> 08:03.187
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.

08:03.365 --> 08:08.273
Just try to focus your sexual energy
on someone else.

08:08.743 --> 08:10.906
Fine.

08:18.195 --> 08:19.390
Take me home.

08:30.587 --> 08:32.317
Do you want a piece of this?

08:36.164 --> 08:38.567
-Hey, Mikey.
-Hey, Pheeb.

08:38.770 --> 08:41.206
-What are you doing?
-Setting rattraps.

08:41.408 --> 08:45.975
-To kill Bob?
-No. No, to test his neck strength.

08:46.217 --> 08:49.451
No, l don't want to kill him.
l thought we were gonna capture him...

08:49.625 --> 08:52.255
...and, you know, set him free
in the countryside...

08:52.430 --> 08:54.332
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...

08:54.501 --> 08:57.438
...and a wisecracking owl.

08:57.741 --> 09:01.475
-Okay, okay. l'll throw away the traps.
-All right, l'll find Bob. l'll get him.

09:01.649 --> 09:05.783
Bob? Bob?

09:05.957 --> 09:08.359
Robert?

09:10.032 --> 09:12.833
Wait, l think l hear him.

09:13.371 --> 09:18.679
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

09:18.850 --> 09:20.443
We'll have to think of a new name.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.056
l don't know,
l kind of like ''Bob'' for a girl.

09:23.258 --> 09:26.561
No, no. l mean, l'm not sure that we--

09:28.168 --> 09:32.074
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

09:32.276 --> 09:34.907
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

09:35.082 --> 09:37.484
Susie?

09:43.331 --> 09:44.561
That's it?

09:44.735 --> 09:46.602
lt's over?

09:46.772 --> 09:48.537
Who shot J.R.?

09:49.578 --> 09:51.673
Who shot J.R.?

09:53.084 --> 09:55.749
l have got to get a job.

09:57.193 --> 09:59.186
What's up?

10:00.399 --> 10:02.529
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

10:04.373 --> 10:07.311
Listen, can you do me a favor?
l'm gonna be out today.

10:07.479 --> 10:08.846
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

10:09.016 --> 10:11.613
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

10:11.822 --> 10:13.951
-You don't trust him?
-Well, no.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.859
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...

10:17.032 --> 10:20.938
...and asked for her daughter,
the ''hot nanny.''

10:21.675 --> 10:24.373
ls this your long-term plan,
for me to run interference?

10:24.548 --> 10:28.214
Because l could get a job any day now.

10:28.388 --> 10:31.987
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

10:32.162 --> 10:35.464
Look, come on, man. l'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

10:35.637 --> 10:38.107
...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?

10:38.341 --> 10:40.208
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.

10:40.379 --> 10:42.976
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...

10:43.151 --> 10:46.613
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

10:48.061 --> 10:50.760
Well, l mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

10:50.933 --> 10:54.771
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

10:57.112 --> 10:59.309
-Picturing that tree?
-l am, yes.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.164
Where you going, Joe?

11:13.546 --> 11:15.310
For a walk.

11:15.516 --> 11:17.451
You mind if l join you?

11:17.821 --> 11:22.991
Actually, l'd rather be alone. You know,
l really need to organize my thoughts.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.499
Your thoughts?

11:26.805 --> 11:28.502
Plural?

11:29.711 --> 11:33.206
All right, fine.
l only have one thought.

11:33.953 --> 11:36.048
lt's about the hot nanny!
l gotta see her!

11:37.059 --> 11:40.590
-l'm afraid l can't let you do that, Joe.
-Now you're saying l can't see her?

11:40.767 --> 11:45.265
You're killing me! She's forbidden fruit!
lt's like, like...

11:45.475 --> 11:49.245
...like she's the princess
and l'm the stable boy.

11:50.118 --> 11:53.215
Look, l know. She's the most
beautiful woman in the world.

11:53.391 --> 11:55.020
l can hear you.

11:55.328 --> 11:59.496
Could you set my pillow and blanket
on the couch for me, please?

12:01.107 --> 12:03.407
Why are you doing this, huh?

12:03.579 --> 12:05.947
Did Ross tell you not to let me
go over there?

12:06.184 --> 12:08.883
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So l can't let you go.

12:09.758 --> 12:12.924
lnteresting. Now there are obstacles.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.597
Hot nanny and me against the world!

12:17.774 --> 12:19.903
This is the stuff great novels
are made of.

12:20.111 --> 12:22.708
-Great novels?
-Fine. Mediocre porn.

12:27.594 --> 12:29.689
-Gavin Mitchell's office.
-Rachel Greene's office.

12:29.865 --> 12:31.424
Give me that phone.

12:32.871 --> 12:36.606
Hello, this is Rachel Greene.
How can l help you?

12:37.680 --> 12:41.643
Okay then.
l'll pass you back to your son.

12:42.824 --> 12:45.660
Hey, Mom.
No, that's just my secretary.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.741
Excuse me, Gavin.
l have a question l need to ask you.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.972
Mom, l'll call you later. Yeah.

12:55.282 --> 12:58.653
-Yes?
-lf you like looking at butts so much...

12:58.822 --> 13:02.283
...why don't you just go
look in a mirror?

13:03.164 --> 13:04.565
Thank God you finally said that.

13:04.734 --> 13:08.036
l saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.448
-Man, l really bug you. Don't l?
-Oh, no. Please...

13:13.619 --> 13:15.451
...l don't care about you
enough to bug me.

13:15.623 --> 13:19.118
ln fact, from now on,
l'm going to take the high road...

13:19.330 --> 13:22.792
...and l'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy...

13:22.971 --> 13:24.337
...starting right now.

13:26.612 --> 13:28.046
-Hey, Rach.
-Hi.

13:28.214 --> 13:30.047
-Ready for your birthday lunch?
-l am.

13:30.218 --> 13:33.281
But first, Monica,
l would like to introduce you...

13:33.458 --> 13:36.625
...to my very talented colleague
and more importantly...

13:36.798 --> 13:39.634
...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.

13:39.871 --> 13:41.636
-Pleased to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

13:41.808 --> 13:43.367
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

13:43.579 --> 13:46.949
Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...

13:47.119 --> 13:49.590
...most likely with his mother.

13:50.191 --> 13:54.495
l don't mind. l'll cancel them. l would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

13:56.605 --> 14:00.773
Why did you invite him?
l can't stand that guy!

14:00.980 --> 14:03.450
-You were being so nice to him.
-l was faking it.

14:03.619 --> 14:05.451
Can't you tell when l'm being fake?

14:06.692 --> 14:09.060
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

14:09.229 --> 14:12.201
Right there.
That was so fake!

14:21.722 --> 14:23.817
Hey, Chandler, which do you like better...

14:23.992 --> 14:26.292
...the tuna tartare
or the mushroom empanadas?

14:28.201 --> 14:32.643
-The pile of raw fish, or the tacos?
-Oh, the tacos. Definitely, the tacos.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.410
l still can't believe you invited Gavin.

14:38.622 --> 14:41.457
He is just the last person
l want to see.

14:41.661 --> 14:45.191
You're welcome for the party.
l'm glad you're having a good time.

14:45.401 --> 14:49.068
l hope he doesn't show up.
Of course he won't, the guy hates me.

14:49.243 --> 14:51.270
-Does he?
-What?

14:51.748 --> 14:54.777
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.

14:54.954 --> 14:57.653
lt's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...

14:57.827 --> 15:00.297
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.

15:00.498 --> 15:03.699
Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

15:03.906 --> 15:07.174
Honey, all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.

15:09.216 --> 15:12.313
-She's out. l'm gonna take her home.
-Okay. Thank you.

15:12.489 --> 15:14.960
Bye, sweetheart.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.227
Do you see what all the guys
see in her?

15:20.438 --> 15:22.966
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

15:23.512 --> 15:24.946
No more vodka for me.

15:26.818 --> 15:29.254
Hey, Rach. So can l sing
''Happy Birthday'' to you now?

15:29.456 --> 15:32.952
-Yeah, sure.
-All right.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.728
See you later.

15:37.673 --> 15:39.506
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.872
Give me!

15:42.015 --> 15:47.481
-Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
-Careful! Careful!

15:47.693 --> 15:50.027
These are my rat babies!

15:52.770 --> 15:56.209
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

15:57.747 --> 16:01.413
You brought rats
to my birthday party?

16:01.621 --> 16:04.559
So this is what a stroke feels like.

16:04.761 --> 16:07.095
Well, l had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

16:07.265 --> 16:09.497
They're our responsibility now.

16:09.671 --> 16:13.634
You know, they require constant care.
You should know that, you're a mother.

16:15.481 --> 16:18.351
Are you comparing my daughter
to a rat?

16:18.588 --> 16:20.558
No. Seven rats.

16:22.128 --> 16:24.428
We should take them home.
We need to feed them.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.366
You're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

16:27.606 --> 16:29.974
Well, l'm sorry, Rachel,
but l'm not like you. Okay?

16:30.144 --> 16:32.809
Not everyone can afford help.

16:40.231 --> 16:42.167
Hey, where the hell
are Joey and Molly?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.827
l asked you to watch them.

16:44.039 --> 16:46.533
l'm sorry. l got a little preoccupied.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.709
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.718
Right behind you, big guy.

16:55.529 --> 16:57.829
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...

16:58.034 --> 17:01.701
...is that acting is a discipline.
lt takes a lot of hard work.

17:01.908 --> 17:04.778
-So where'd you study?
-l didn't go to college.

17:05.014 --> 17:10.890
-No, where'd you study acting?
-Molly, people don't study acting.

17:13.765 --> 17:17.569
Molly, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

17:17.773 --> 17:20.039
-Sure. l'll go check on Emma.
-Thanks.

17:21.981 --> 17:25.044
Will the stable boy
never get the princess?

17:25.388 --> 17:29.557
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

17:29.764 --> 17:32.964
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

17:34.306 --> 17:37.575
This isn't fair. What makes you think
l'm gonna sleep with her...

17:37.746 --> 17:39.112
...and then blow her off, huh?

17:39.282 --> 17:43.724
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that l actually like her...

17:43.892 --> 17:45.725
...and might want something real?

17:47.298 --> 17:52.434
Look, the truth is, l haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

17:52.610 --> 17:55.810
Okay?
l didn't think l could ever love again.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.275
-Come on!
-Joe!

18:04.634 --> 18:06.968
Hi. ls Molly here?

18:07.172 --> 18:08.869
Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

18:09.376 --> 18:14.718
-Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
-Hey.

18:16.156 --> 18:19.687
-l'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

18:28.915 --> 18:33.219
Well, Joey, l guess
we have no problem.

18:34.326 --> 18:38.198
lt's like my favorite fairy tale
come true.

18:39.537 --> 18:42.907
The princess, the stable boy
and the lesbian.

18:46.383 --> 18:48.650
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formula...

18:48.855 --> 18:50.552
...and l'll start changing the box.

18:50.726 --> 18:53.857
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

18:54.065 --> 18:55.932
When did we become
one of those couples...

18:56.103 --> 18:58.597
...whose lives revolve around
their rats?

19:00.244 --> 19:02.943
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.

19:03.150 --> 19:06.646
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

19:06.891 --> 19:09.259
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

19:09.462 --> 19:12.434
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

19:12.770 --> 19:15.206
Yeah, not such a problem with rats.

19:15.408 --> 19:18.813
No, they're more of a ''love the one
you're with'' kind of animal.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.678
No. Really?

19:21.854 --> 19:25.315
Oh, my-- Get off your sister!

19:26.998 --> 19:29.526
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

19:29.704 --> 19:32.835
The-- We have seven rats.

19:33.010 --> 19:35.641
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...

19:35.816 --> 19:39.756
...and then each of those
has seven rats? That's like....

19:42.863 --> 19:45.994
That's math l can't even do!

19:47.004 --> 19:48.974
What are we gonna do?

19:49.175 --> 19:51.578
Well, l know this is gonna
sound crazy...

19:51.748 --> 19:58.353
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.

20:00.398 --> 20:03.963
Yeah, okay. l guess you're right.

20:04.139 --> 20:07.510
All right, so we should just
give them away.

20:08.113 --> 20:13.614
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.160
Those were Bob's favorites.

20:16.329 --> 20:18.265
lt's gonna be okay.

20:19.570 --> 20:23.339
-You must think l'm crazy.
-No, l think you're sweet.

20:23.545 --> 20:29.979
Good. This is just so hard.
lt's hard for me to let them go.

20:30.157 --> 20:34.120
l guess it just brings back memories,
you know...

20:34.667 --> 20:39.575
...from when l gave birth to my brother's
triplets and l had to give them up.

20:45.589 --> 20:47.991
l haven't told you about that yet,
have l?

21:00.552 --> 21:03.820
Thanks for the party, honey.
Should l help you clean up?

21:03.992 --> 21:08.330
No way. You had your party.
Now l have mine.

21:11.406 --> 21:13.570
-ls everything all right?
-l just get bummed...

21:13.745 --> 21:15.236
...when my birthday's over.

21:15.414 --> 21:18.649
Well, at least you have one thing
to be happy about.

21:18.821 --> 21:21.850
That jerk, Gavin, from your office
didn't show up.

21:22.028 --> 21:24.727
Yeah, l hate him.

21:26.871 --> 21:30.037
We weren't talking about you.
We were....

21:30.244 --> 21:34.116
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

21:35.789 --> 21:39.228
-Fun party.
-Well, it was.

21:39.395 --> 21:42.196
And you would have seen it
if you didn't show up at....

21:42.368 --> 21:47.869
9:30?! God! This party was lame.

21:48.213 --> 21:50.980
Again, you're welcome!

21:51.152 --> 21:55.856
-Look, l'll just give you this and go.
-You bought me a present. Why?

21:57.031 --> 22:00.732
Let me explain how birthday parties
usually work. There are presents...

22:00.905 --> 22:03.741
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.052
Okay, l....

22:08.253 --> 22:12.193
l got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

22:12.863 --> 22:17.361
Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

22:18.273 --> 22:20.744
-''From Gavin.''
-l really mean it.

22:27.993 --> 22:29.553
lt's beautiful.

22:29.763 --> 22:31.960
lf you don't mind...?
Let me.

22:34.272 --> 22:37.507
Well, what do you know, it fits.

22:39.516 --> 22:43.957
See, Gavin. You're capable of being
a nice guy.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.186
Why do you give me such a hard time?

22:47.465 --> 22:48.991
l'm not sure.

22:49.302 --> 22:54.210
Well, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.

22:54.445 --> 22:56.507
l do have feelings for you.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.552
-You do?
-Yes. l feel that you're a little annoying.

23:03.029 --> 23:04.361
See, why? Gavin, why?

23:04.633 --> 23:08.664
Right when l'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you--

23:12.014 --> 23:14.747
And you do that.

23:40.605 --> 23:43.907
Hey. Listen,
l think l left something here.

23:45.013 --> 23:47.985
Well, somebody left this.
ls this yours?

23:48.186 --> 23:49.655
No, but l like it.

23:50.859 --> 23:53.831
No, l think l left one of my rat babies.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.471
Well, no. l haven't seen it,
but if l do, l'll let you know.

23:58.641 --> 24:01.943
Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

24:03.517 --> 24:04.542
Maybe that's him.

24:06.991 --> 24:08.984
