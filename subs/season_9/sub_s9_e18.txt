Monica?
Hey, can l borrow the Porsche?

00:09.418 --> 00:11.149
-Okay.
-All right!

00:11.322 --> 00:13.725
But what is it not?

00:14.328 --> 00:17.323
A place to entertain my lady friends.

00:17.935 --> 00:22.433
-And what else is it not?
-A place to eat spaghetti.

00:23.112 --> 00:25.241
Very good. What do you need
it for anyway?

00:25.450 --> 00:27.887
The Powerball lottery
is up to 300 million...

00:28.122 --> 00:32.564
-...and they don<i>'</i>t sell tickets here.
-So you<i>'</i>re driving up to Connecticut?

00:32.765 --> 00:35.965
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.810
Maybe l<i>'</i>ll drive you up there.
l<i>'</i>d like to buy some tickets myself.

00:41.182 --> 00:45.384
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

00:45.558 --> 00:50.499
Yes, because if l was at my old job,
we<i>'</i>d say, ''300 million? No, thank you.''

00:52.337 --> 00:54.398
-Will you get me tickets too?
-Yeah, me too.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.272
-Sure.
-l have an idea.

00:56.445 --> 00:59.714
Why don<i>'</i>t we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we<i>'</i>ll pool our money together...

00:59.886 --> 01:03.587
-...and then if we win, we<i>'</i>ll split it.
-That<i>'</i>s a great idea!

01:04.128 --> 01:06.462
No, thanks.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.466
-You don<i>'</i>t wanna win the lottery?
-Sure l do.

01:09.639 --> 01:11.666
l also want to be king
of my own country...

01:11.843 --> 01:14.610
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

01:15.216 --> 01:18.382
-Still on Amelia Earhart?
-The woman just vanished!

01:20.093 --> 01:21.892
Seriously, you don<i>'</i>t want in on this?

01:22.097 --> 01:25.001
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

01:25.170 --> 01:28.803
l mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

01:29.011 --> 01:32.177
But there<i>'</i>s six of us, so we<i>'</i>d
only have to get struck 7 times.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.581
l like those odds!

01:35.390 --> 01:39.296
Seriously, you guys, l can<i>'</i>t believe
you<i>'</i>re gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

01:39.464 --> 01:42.699
l mean, that<i>'</i>s such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

01:46.045 --> 01:47.981
l<i>'</i>ll ask.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.208
''Boo-hockey''?

01:51.188 --> 01:53.351
Oh, we think Emma<i>'</i>s about
to start talking...

01:53.527 --> 01:57.159
...so we<i>'</i>re trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.531
So get ready to hear a lot
of boo-hockey...

01:59.706 --> 02:02.302
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

02:03.981 --> 02:05.951
How do you know
she<i>'</i>s gonna start talking?

02:06.151 --> 02:09.989
When l talk to her, l almost feel
like she understands what l'm saying.

02:10.159 --> 02:12.026
Kind of like Joey.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.226
What<i>'</i>s that now?

03:06.840 --> 03:10.472
God, look at all these tickets.
lt<i>'</i>s so exciting.

03:10.714 --> 03:12.684
l haven<i>'</i>t won anything
since sixth grade.

03:12.885 --> 03:15.185
Pie-eating contest?

03:17.026 --> 03:20.522
You assume because l was heavy that<i>'</i>s
the only way l could win something?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.729
No, l saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.776
-That was a good day.
-Yeah.

03:27.380 --> 03:31.343
-They<i>'</i>re towing your car!
-l'm parked in a garage on Morton.

03:32.190 --> 03:34.753
They<i>'</i>re towing a car.

03:34.929 --> 03:38.664
And l am seeing spots.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.535
Ross, you don<i>'</i>t have Emma!
Rachel, you don<i>'</i>t have Emma!

03:41.709 --> 03:44.111
-Where<i>'</i>s Emma? Who has Emma?
-Joey, relax.

03:44.281 --> 03:48.586
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

03:49.592 --> 03:52.392
-l was?
-Yes, and you talked to her.

03:52.798 --> 03:55.895
-l did?
-She dropped off a casserole.

03:56.104 --> 03:59.076
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

03:59.344 --> 04:01.645
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

04:01.850 --> 04:05.414
Yeah. And then l figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

04:05.591 --> 04:10.032
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

04:11.134 --> 04:13.503
Don<i>'</i>t touch the phone!
l<i>'</i>ll get it!

04:13.974 --> 04:16.605
-You think he washed his hands?
-Hello?

04:16.813 --> 04:19.147
-Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
-What<i>'</i>s going on?

04:19.351 --> 04:22.586
Chandler<i>'</i>s supposed to find out
if he<i>'</i>s getting a job at his agency.

04:22.758 --> 04:25.160
But out of 1 5 interns,
they<i>'</i>re only hiring three.

04:25.363 --> 04:27.162
-Tough odds.
-Yeah.

04:27.367 --> 04:31.137
lf only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

04:32.176 --> 04:35.980
Yeah, look who<i>'</i>s coming around!

04:36.184 --> 04:39.885
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

04:41.228 --> 04:44.098
-Did you get it?
-One of the slots got filled.

04:44.602 --> 04:49.043
-By you?
-Sense the tone.

04:50.346 --> 04:53.877
-No, that kid Nate got it.
-Oh, l hate that guy.

04:54.054 --> 04:57.288
l mean, come on, kid,
pull up your pants!

04:57.460 --> 04:59.362
Well, there<i>'</i>s two spots left, right?

04:59.565 --> 05:02.195
Yeah. l mean, l want this so much.
l wanna get one.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.568
l want my friend Charlie
to get one.

05:04.742 --> 05:06.837
Except l don<i>'</i>t care about Charlie.

05:08.717 --> 05:09.776
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey!

05:09.952 --> 05:12.719
You are not gonna believe this.
l just saw my psychic...

05:12.891 --> 05:16.763
...and she said l was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

05:18.135 --> 05:20.230
l thought we could use
some extra luck...

05:20.406 --> 05:22.433
...so l brought a wishbone home
from work.

05:22.645 --> 05:29.113
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.652
-All right, who wants to do it?
-Can l?

05:31.896 --> 05:34.834
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.872
lt<i>'</i>s really not fair. Just because
we don<i>'</i>t eat the meat...

05:38.042 --> 05:41.105
...doesn<i>'</i>t mean we don<i>'</i>t like
to play with the carcasses.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.446
All right. Rach?

05:43.653 --> 05:46.021
l don<i>'</i>t want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

05:46.224 --> 05:49.789
l<i>'</i>ll do it! lt<i>'</i>ll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

05:52.236 --> 05:54.867
-l hope l win.
-Well, it doesn<i>'</i>t really matter.

05:55.042 --> 05:57.012
You<i>'</i>re both wishing
for the same thing.

05:57.213 --> 06:01.985
l can<i>'</i>t tell you what l'm wishing for,
or else, you know, it won<i>'</i>t come true.

06:02.323 --> 06:05.227
Right. But we know
what you<i>'</i>re wishing for.

06:05.463 --> 06:08.401
-l can<i>'</i>t really say.
-l understand.

06:08.570 --> 06:11.097
But you<i>'</i>re wishing
for what we think, aren<i>'</i>t you?

06:11.341 --> 06:14.074
l'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

06:14.247 --> 06:16.342
-Please!
-Just do it!

06:16.552 --> 06:18.522
Okay. One, two, three.

06:18.690 --> 06:20.592
l won! Hey!

06:20.761 --> 06:23.892
You know what? l'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

06:24.067 --> 06:28.941
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

06:30.246 --> 06:32.273
That thing gets hot!

06:32.450 --> 06:34.113
Ross, just keep making your jokes.

06:34.287 --> 06:36.520
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

06:36.726 --> 06:39.892
-You<i>'</i>re not gonna win.
-l know the odds are against us...

06:40.065 --> 06:44.233
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

06:44.407 --> 06:48.142
We<i>'</i>re gonna be like, ''Everybody, let<i>'</i>s
take our helicopters up to the Cape.''

06:48.315 --> 06:50.684
And you<i>'</i>re gonna be all,
like, ''Oh, l can<i>'</i>t, guys.

06:50.854 --> 06:54.088
l<i>'</i>ll have to meet you up there.
l gotta gas up the Hyundai.''

06:58.202 --> 07:02.267
Okay, l<i>'</i>ve heard myself on tape,
and l sound nothing like that.

07:03.078 --> 07:05.641
l can see the headline now:
''Lottery Winners' Friend...

07:05.817 --> 07:08.219
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm.''

07:08.957 --> 07:10.391
Why would l eat my own arm?

07:10.627 --> 07:14.191
Well, you wouldn<i>'</i>t, but we own the paper.
We can print whatever we want.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.998
You know what? l'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

07:17.674 --> 07:19.610
-Why?
-Because l know that you think...

07:19.778 --> 07:22.841
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

07:23.218 --> 07:26.749
...but we<i>'</i>re all here, and we<i>'</i>re gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

07:26.926 --> 07:30.923
And you<i>'</i>re my brother,
and l want you to be a part of this.

07:31.669 --> 07:35.369
You don<i>'</i>t have to do that.
l mean, l<i>'</i>ll pay for myself.

07:35.543 --> 07:39.414
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that<i>'</i>s so sweet.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.213
Come here.

07:42.256 --> 07:44.727
Get a room.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.733
So now that you<i>'</i>re in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

07:50.941 --> 07:55.576
-l don<i>'</i>t know. l<i>'</i>ll probably just invest it.
-Calm down.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.551
Seriously, that<i>'</i>s your fantasy?
To invest it?

07:58.756 --> 08:03.459
Oh, l'm sorry. Did l say, ''invest it''?
l meant, ''Be cool and piss it all away.''

08:05.770 --> 08:09.402
l know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

08:09.745 --> 08:11.612
l don<i>'</i>t really care about the Knicks.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.754
You will when l pick you
as starting forward.

08:15.155 --> 08:19.152
You would do that?
l never get picked!

08:19.698 --> 08:21.691
l'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

08:21.869 --> 08:25.239
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
l can<i>'</i>t believe you<i>'</i>re taking this away.

08:25.510 --> 08:29.472
You<i>'</i>re right, it has been your dream
for over 1 5 seconds.

08:30.285 --> 08:33.747
How long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

08:34.260 --> 08:38.291
l<i>'</i>ll take this one too.
''Mommy''?

08:38.970 --> 08:41.497
Oh, l<i>'</i>ve gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel...

08:41.675 --> 08:43.736
...''Mommy'' when we<i>'</i>re around Emma.

08:43.913 --> 08:47.819
Which l now realize we are not.

08:48.923 --> 08:52.362
l'm hoping that if she hears it enough,
it<i>'</i>ll be her first word.

08:52.564 --> 08:56.732
Although if we<i>'</i>re gonna do that,
we should probably call me ''Daddy'' too.

08:57.239 --> 08:59.733
l like that, Daddy.

09:03.452 --> 09:06.356
l was just talking about Rachel.

09:06.559 --> 09:09.428
ls Daddy getting angry?

09:11.334 --> 09:13.965
ls Daddy gonna spank me?

09:15.910 --> 09:18.142
Well, that depends.

09:18.348 --> 09:21.081
Have you been a bad--?
No, l can<i>'</i>t.

09:24.561 --> 09:28.763
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

09:29.771 --> 09:32.298
What? Susan got it? How?

09:32.476 --> 09:35.608
Oh, man, l would<i>'</i>ve slept with him!

09:36.384 --> 09:38.411
All right, bye.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.621
Dude, l'm sorry.
But hey, there<i>'</i>s one spot left, right?

09:41.795 --> 09:44.493
-Well, Charlie<i>'</i>s gonna get that.
-Hey, don<i>'</i>t say that.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.332
You<i>'</i>ve got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.203
He is the boss<i>'</i> son.

09:49.778 --> 09:52.305
-Come on, lottery!
-Yeah!

09:52.483 --> 09:55.182
-lt starts in, like, 20 minutes.
-Okay, here we go.

09:55.355 --> 09:58.726
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.629
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.965
Okay, how about this:

10:04.741 --> 10:06.802
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

10:06.979 --> 10:10.008
The remaining 1 0 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

10:10.219 --> 10:12.986
-l have another idea.
-l'm sorry, idea time is over.

10:15.062 --> 10:17.533
-Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
-Yeah.

10:17.734 --> 10:21.195
-What about the ones on the nightstand?
-There are no tickets there.

10:21.407 --> 10:24.174
Yes, there are.
l just saw them a few minutes ago.

10:24.982 --> 10:27.749
No, you didn<i>'</i>t.
You must be mistaken.

10:27.921 --> 10:31.725
-There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
-Chandler, sense the tone.

10:33.398 --> 10:37.601
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

10:38.576 --> 10:41.946
Okay, fine. l bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

10:42.784 --> 10:45.881
The psychic also said that
l would be betrayed.

10:47.594 --> 10:50.463
l can<i>'</i>t believe this.
l thought we were all in this together.

10:50.667 --> 10:54.003
-Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
-Three minutes ago!

10:54.173 --> 10:56.736
l don<i>'</i>t know why that<i>'</i>s important.

10:56.945 --> 11:01.079
l was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

11:01.287 --> 11:05.786
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.861
l<i>'</i>ll show you how.

11:08.836 --> 11:12.138
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

11:12.309 --> 11:15.145
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

11:15.349 --> 11:19.153
Please. lf l win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

11:19.323 --> 11:23.491
Someone gave me muffins last week, and
l couldn<i>'</i>t get rid of you for three days!

11:24.601 --> 11:27.801
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

11:28.007 --> 11:30.877
She<i>'</i>s right. You shouldn<i>'</i>t have
bought tickets just for us.

11:31.114 --> 11:32.708
Let me finish.

11:32.884 --> 11:35.515
However, it doesn<i>'</i>t look like
l'm gonna get this job...

11:35.690 --> 11:40.028
...so l can<i>'</i>t afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.563
There<i>'</i>s the man l married.

11:43.839 --> 11:46.105
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

11:46.277 --> 11:48.270
...it<i>'</i>s the last you<i>'</i>re gonna hear
from us.

11:48.516 --> 11:53.219
Fine. Don<i>'</i>t be my friends.
l<i>'</i>ll buy new friends.

11:53.458 --> 11:58.400
Yeah, and then l<i>'</i>ll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

11:58.569 --> 12:01.199
You know what?
l want my share of the tickets.

12:01.374 --> 12:03.868
l want my tickets too!
And l'm buying the Knicks!

12:04.046 --> 12:06.482
And Steffi Graf!

12:06.685 --> 12:09.053
Cool. Then l want mine too!
And if l win...

12:09.223 --> 12:12.389
...l'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

12:12.597 --> 12:16.935
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

12:17.105 --> 12:19.132
No. No, we should divide them up...

12:19.310 --> 12:21.747
...and l should get extra because
we used my car!

12:21.949 --> 12:24.648
Hey! Hey! lf anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

12:24.821 --> 12:29.455
-This whole thing was my idea!
-Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

12:30.533 --> 12:33.003
Just give them to me,
and l<i>'</i>ll split them up!

12:35.375 --> 12:37.436
Hey, hey!

12:38.114 --> 12:41.143
God, l can<i>'</i>t take it anymore!
l'm putting an end to this!

12:41.354 --> 12:44.691
-Okay, if she jumps, l get her tickets!
-Wait, no, no! Hey!

12:46.497 --> 12:49.492
lf we<i>'</i>re not doing this together,
we<i>'</i>re not doing it at all.

12:49.671 --> 12:52.005
-Say goodbye to your tickets.
-No! No! No!

12:52.209 --> 12:54.806
Do not come any closer!

12:54.981 --> 12:58.682
Can l come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

12:58.889 --> 13:01.554
Now, what<i>'</i>s more important,
your friends or money?

13:01.795 --> 13:04.163
-Friends!
-Money!

13:07.507 --> 13:09.032
Friends.

13:09.911 --> 13:12.347
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

13:12.550 --> 13:14.348
They<i>'</i>re all in there.

13:15.322 --> 13:18.625
-Even these five that l hid in my bra.
-Monica!

13:18.829 --> 13:21.630
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.636
There is no way l was
gonna dump this--

13:24.841 --> 13:27.141
God! No!

13:30.118 --> 13:32.783
l think l broke your bowl.

13:33.091 --> 13:35.756
Go! Go! Go!

13:47.954 --> 13:52.156
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.127
And the wind sure made it fun.

13:55.970 --> 13:58.372
-Phoebe, we lost half of them.
-So what?

13:58.542 --> 14:00.705
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

14:00.913 --> 14:04.352
My psychic said l was
gonna win, remember?

14:04.521 --> 14:09.053
Weird your psychic didn<i>'</i>t mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

14:09.798 --> 14:13.396
As a matter of fact, she said
that<i>'</i>s how l'm going to die.

14:13.572 --> 14:17.876
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

14:18.047 --> 14:20.210
There<i>'</i>s two messages.
This could be from work.

14:20.385 --> 14:24.086
-Oh, play them.
-Okay. Here we go.

14:25.161 --> 14:31.003
<i>Hello. This is the pigeon from</i>
<i>the balcony calling to apologize.</i>

14:31.474 --> 14:36.918
<i>I shouldn</i>'<i>t have knocked the tickets</i>
<i>out of the pretty lady</i>'<i>s hand.</i>

14:37.587 --> 14:42.119
<i>It was all my fault.</i>
<i>Not hers. Bye.</i>

14:47.940 --> 14:51.140
Well, l bet that was very hard
for him to do.

14:53.251 --> 14:54.914
<i>Hey, Chandler, it</i>'<i>s Charlie.</i>

14:55.088 --> 14:56.955
This is it.

14:57.125 --> 15:01.293
<i>Listen, it turns out I got the last spot.</i>

15:01.467 --> 15:04.303
<i>I'm really sorry, man.</i>
<i>It was a lot of fun working with you.</i>

15:04.473 --> 15:06.944
<i>Give me a call if you want.</i>

15:07.112 --> 15:09.845
Gosh, l'm so sorry, honey.

15:10.051 --> 15:11.577
Sorry, Chandler.

15:11.755 --> 15:16.663
lt is so unfair. lt<i>'</i>s like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

15:16.865 --> 15:18.596
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

15:18.802 --> 15:22.468
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

15:22.710 --> 15:25.078
You guys, the drawing<i>'</i>s
about to start.

15:25.248 --> 15:27.685
We should call my mom<i>'</i>s
and say good night to Emma...

15:27.854 --> 15:29.881
-...before she goes down.
-Good idea.

15:30.391 --> 15:33.192
Honey, you<i>'</i>re being really strong
about this.

15:33.364 --> 15:35.892
l know how badly you wanted that job.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.903
Yeah, you know, l really
thought l deserved it.

15:39.209 --> 15:44.517
But let<i>'</i>s go win the lottery. l mean, we
still have a 1 30 chances to win, right?

15:46.156 --> 15:48.559
Hundred and thirty-one.

15:49.496 --> 15:52.195
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
l love you.

15:52.369 --> 15:56.207
And remember,
you<i>'</i>re Daddy<i>'</i>s little girl.

15:56.377 --> 15:59.372
Phoebe<i>'</i>s totally ruined that for me.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.181
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

16:04.359 --> 16:06.352
Rach, they<i>'</i>re announcing
the numbers!

16:07.098 --> 16:10.560
My God, l can already feel
myself changing.

16:10.973 --> 16:14.879
<i>Here are your official Powerball</i>
<i>numbers. We have 53.</i>

16:15.081 --> 16:17.575
-l<i>'</i>ve got that.
-We have one too!

16:17.753 --> 16:20.554
We are on the road, people!

16:21.895 --> 16:22.920
Come on!

16:23.130 --> 16:28.597
Mom, please, l know you love your new
lips, but l can barely understand you.

16:28.775 --> 16:31.906
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

16:32.115 --> 16:34.483
<i>And here we go.</i>
<i>The Powerball is seven.</i>

16:34.721 --> 16:38.421
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

16:39.864 --> 16:41.857
You guys,
you<i>'</i>re not gonna believe this.

16:42.035 --> 16:45.439
l was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

16:45.843 --> 16:47.745
-What?
-Well, what did she say?

16:47.947 --> 16:50.783
She said, ''Gleba'' !

16:54.627 --> 16:56.859
Make me rich!

16:57.499 --> 17:00.870
-lsn<i>'</i>t that amazing?
-Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that<i>'</i>s great.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.771
Why aren<i>'</i>t you more excited?

17:03.512 --> 17:07.212
Rach, gleba is not a word.

17:07.653 --> 17:11.650
-Well, of course it is.
-Okay. What does it mean?

17:11.861 --> 17:14.890
Well, l don<i>'</i>t know all the words.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.763
You know, l'm just glad l didn<i>'</i>t
miss my daughter<i>'</i>s first word.

17:18.942 --> 17:23.315
-Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
-Okay. Use it in a sentence.

17:23.518 --> 17:27.321
Okay. Emma just said, ''Gleba.''

17:30.364 --> 17:34.361
-lt<i>'</i>s not a word.
-Okay, fine. l'm gonna look it up.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.065
Okay, great.

17:36.276 --> 17:39.373
While you<i>'</i>re at it,
she said another word the other day.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.577
Why don<i>'</i>t you look up:

17:45.896 --> 17:50.269
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba.
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

17:50.471 --> 17:55.881
Here it is! ''The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi.''

18:00.659 --> 18:04.189
She<i>'</i>s gonna be a scientist.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.008
-Damn it. Anybody got anything?
-No.

18:14.687 --> 18:16.349
l'm still looking through mine.

18:16.558 --> 18:19.724
Just double-checking. No.

18:19.931 --> 18:22.835
No. No.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.707
No!

18:32.957 --> 18:35.724
Hello? Hold on.

18:35.896 --> 18:37.159
lt<i>'</i>s your boss.

18:37.332 --> 18:39.895
The ''l'm sorry l rejected you'' phone call.

18:40.071 --> 18:42.702
l'm not used to getting these
from guys.

18:43.745 --> 18:46.238
-Hey, Steve.
-Chandler, hi.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.354
l'm sure you<i>'</i>ve heard
we filled the three positions.

18:49.523 --> 18:51.857
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

18:52.028 --> 18:54.498
...you wouldn<i>'</i>t be happy
being someone<i>'</i>s assistant.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.262
l<i>'</i>d love to be somebody<i>'</i>s
assistant. Answering phones...

18:57.438 --> 18:59.271
...getting coffee,
l live for that stuff.

18:59.442 --> 19:04.384
And l<i>'</i>m not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

19:06.423 --> 19:09.726
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

19:09.897 --> 19:13.336
We<i>'</i>re offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

19:15.074 --> 19:17.807
Me? That guy
who just said, ''butt cracks''?

19:17.980 --> 19:19.175
<i>Yes, that</i>'<i>s right.</i>

19:19.416 --> 19:21.751
We<i>'</i>re excited about the level
of sophistication...

19:21.921 --> 19:24.255
...you<i>'</i>ll be bringing to the job.

19:25.662 --> 19:29.328
Okay. Well, thanks, you won<i>'</i>t regret it.
l<i>'</i>ll see you tomorrow.

19:41.828 --> 19:43.490
What?

19:43.665 --> 19:46.397
Oh, yeah, l'm gonna
be a junior copywriter.

19:47.706 --> 19:50.678
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, l'm so proud of you.

19:50.846 --> 19:53.476
Thanks. Does that mean
l get the good loving tonight?

19:53.651 --> 19:57.488
You bet. No TV or anything.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.496
-Hey, that is so great about the job.
-Thanks, man.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.830
l<i>'</i>d like to think l had
something to do with it.

20:04.038 --> 20:07.238
-Really? Why?
-Well, before with the wishbone.

20:07.412 --> 20:13.186
l didn<i>'</i>t wish we would win the lottery.
l wished you<i>'</i>d get the job.

20:13.658 --> 20:15.685
Oh, yeah?

20:16.096 --> 20:19.536
Listen, don<i>'</i>t tell Monica.
She<i>'</i>ll rip your heart right out.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.702
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

20:24.880 --> 20:26.941
...that really thought
we were gonna win.

20:27.185 --> 20:33.620
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.228
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

20:38.407 --> 20:40.970
-Seven.
-We won.

20:41.279 --> 20:43.078
-What?
-We won!

20:43.250 --> 20:45.949
-Let me see! Let me see!
-Don<i>'</i>t tear it!

20:46.323 --> 20:50.127
Phoebe, you don<i>'</i>t have any
of the first five numbers!

20:51.233 --> 20:57.474
l know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

20:58.347 --> 21:02.447
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

21:02.623 --> 21:07.257
l don<i>'</i>t care. l<i>'</i>ve never won
anything before. l can<i>'</i>t believe this!

21:07.465 --> 21:09.698
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

21:09.904 --> 21:14.174
Well, it<i>'</i>s not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.709
You know what?
You can have mine.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.147
-Me too.
-Me too.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.553
Me too.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.237
Well, l guess if everybody else is.

21:37.325 --> 21:40.297
Hey, guys. So l just called
the Powerball hot line.

21:40.632 --> 21:45.768
-Can you believe it? Nobody won.
-l beg to differ.

21:47.278 --> 21:50.911
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

21:51.086 --> 21:55.994
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $ 1 0,000.

22:06.149 --> 22:10.648
Again, don<i>'</i>t blame the pretty lady.

22:11.026 --> 22:15.968
lt was not her fault.
lt was me, the pigeon.

22:19.543 --> 22:21.536
Seriously, stop staring at her.
