WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:06.730
-Thanks for the tasty dinner.
-You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.973
What are you guys looking at?

00:09.142 --> 00:11.542
Ross and the most beautiful girl
in the world.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.742
Yeah, come to Papa!

00:19.219 --> 00:20.584
I know!

00:22.689 --> 00:24.680
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

00:24.891 --> 00:27.257
...but did you see the ass on her?

00:27.494 --> 00:29.724
What did you...?
When did you...?

00:29.996 --> 00:32.897
How did you...?
How did you get a girl like that?

00:34.100 --> 00:38.400
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

00:38.638 --> 00:41.937
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

00:42.142 --> 00:44.303
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.141
But that's, like, the easiest era.

00:48.848 --> 00:51.681
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured....

00:53.887 --> 00:56.378
But I made her dinner.

00:56.689 --> 01:00.090
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

01:02.595 --> 01:06.497
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.065
Fine by me.
Hope she wins.

01:11.337 --> 01:14.636
Hey, we should have
a contest. Yeah.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.174
See who can bring home
the most beautiful woman.

01:17.577 --> 01:21.206
That's a good idea, Joe.
We could call it life.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.273
The One with the Dirty Girl

02:09.195 --> 02:10.958
You have any wrapping paper?

02:11.264 --> 02:13.061
Is it for my birthday present?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.768
It was your birthday months ago.

02:16.369 --> 02:21.102
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.001
I have a call in about that.

02:27.614 --> 02:31.414
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.109
The Velveteen Rabbit!

02:34.387 --> 02:37.049
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real....

02:37.290 --> 02:40.657
Don't touch it because
your fingers have destructive oils.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.796
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.233
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

02:49.469 --> 02:52.063
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

02:52.272 --> 02:56.641
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.500
Honey, that's so sweet.

02:58.811 --> 03:03.407
What a great way to say, "l secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

03:04.617 --> 03:06.107
It doesn't say that.

03:06.786 --> 03:07.775
Does it?

03:08.421 --> 03:12.687
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

03:12.926 --> 03:16.919
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

03:17.463 --> 03:20.830
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.299
It's got to be better than that book.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.094
Like a crossbow!

03:27.440 --> 03:29.032
Once again, I am sorry.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.032
Thank you. Bye.

03:32.445 --> 03:36.074
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

03:36.449 --> 03:39.282
Oh, my God!
What happened?

03:39.786 --> 03:41.378
Sixty guests.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.056
Why'd you have to turn it down?

03:47.260 --> 03:49.558
I don't have
the money or equipment...

03:49.796 --> 03:53.254
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.730
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

03:56.336 --> 03:59.237
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!

04:01.007 --> 04:02.497
Moni-ca.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.511
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.341
-Do you want to be a caterer?
-I don't know.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.517
There you go!
That's the spirit!

04:14.153 --> 04:18.089
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

04:18.324 --> 04:21.760
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

04:22.028 --> 04:26.590
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

04:26.799 --> 04:30.428
-Neither have you.
-Yes, but I'm doing this.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.164
That would be great! Thank you.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.778
-Can I borrow your apartment keys?
-Why?

04:44.617 --> 04:45.811
You can pee here.

04:49.989 --> 04:52.116
Yes, I can, of course.

04:53.192 --> 04:56.286
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.824
What are you getting
for her birthday?

05:02.101 --> 05:06.003
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.935
You have to get her
something really nice.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.271
-I know!
-And not one of your coupons...

05:12.512 --> 05:14.241
...for an hour of "Joey Love."

05:20.353 --> 05:23.322
-A crossword! Can I help?
-No.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.684
Last week I got all
but three answers...

05:25.892 --> 05:28.486
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

05:28.795 --> 05:29.784
Fine.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.794
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

05:35.868 --> 05:36.892
How'd it go?

05:37.170 --> 05:40.162
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

05:41.074 --> 05:42.974
Everyone loved the food.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.677
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.073
The dead guy from today's best friend.

05:48.548 --> 05:52.211
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.386
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

05:54.587 --> 05:57.317
Thanks. Check out
my new catering stuff.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.858
Look!
I'm an omelet station!

06:00.259 --> 06:02.056
Omelet? Made to order?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.587
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.658
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

06:10.937 --> 06:14.395
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.569
I used it to buy all this stuff.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.008
Aborigine.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.616
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.256
Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.128
Aborigine.
Oh, no, I tried that already.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.177
Would you like to come in?

06:52.845 --> 06:56.713
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?

06:58.217 --> 07:00.048
According to recent findings.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.730
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

07:15.368 --> 07:17.131
Mitzi is...?

07:17.336 --> 07:19.133
My hamster.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.304
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.370
Have a seat.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.976
Where?

07:27.680 --> 07:29.511
Oh, hey. Do you....

07:33.753 --> 07:36.722
Do you have any
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

07:37.824 --> 07:39.519
Well, I do.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.987
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

07:44.230 --> 07:47.996
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties....

07:49.569 --> 07:52.697
-I'd rather not.
-Oh, yeah? Why not?

07:54.173 --> 07:56.505
Don't take this the wrong way...

07:56.742 --> 08:00.178
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

08:07.386 --> 08:10.446
-ls everything in the car?
-Did you settle the bill?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.187
I hate this part.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.451
Look what we almost left!

08:16.696 --> 08:18.129
That's not mine.

08:18.865 --> 08:21.265
Look what we almost took!

08:28.608 --> 08:30.235
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?

08:30.743 --> 08:32.370
Well, we're all cleaned up.

08:33.646 --> 08:35.978
Good. Thank you.

08:39.485 --> 08:43.387
And, well, there's
this small matter of the....

08:44.423 --> 08:46.254
-Dear?
-The matter of...

08:47.560 --> 08:48.652
...payment.

08:49.795 --> 08:53.595
Jack used to handle the finances.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.035
-You get it?
-No, but I made a widow cry.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.507
See you in hell.

09:12.084 --> 09:14.416
You know what we should all do?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.747
Go see a musical.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.725
Sure.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.427
You know which one?

09:24.697 --> 09:27.598
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

09:28.434 --> 09:31.164
I mean, that one's gotta be good.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.869
Do you know the name of that one?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.605
I don't know. Grease?

09:41.547 --> 09:42.878
Rent?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.181
Yes! Rent!

09:46.052 --> 09:47.542
So when do you want to go?

09:47.787 --> 09:50.278
What? I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.994
Man, it is so hard
to shop for girls.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.055
Yes, it is...

10:01.300 --> 10:03.325
...at Office Max!

10:05.471 --> 10:06.961
What did you get her?

10:08.307 --> 10:09.968
A pen.

10:10.977 --> 10:15.414
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.345
-You can't give her that.
-Why not?

10:19.652 --> 10:20.744
She's not 11!

10:22.555 --> 10:25.183
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.696
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

10:31.931 --> 10:34.491
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.031
Sure it is.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.496
She needs a pen for work.

10:37.770 --> 10:42.332
She's writing. She turns it over.
"It's time for my date with Joey!"

10:44.377 --> 10:48.575
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

10:49.382 --> 10:50.906
She didn't have one.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.351
For three years?

10:55.888 --> 10:58.686
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.915
I can't shop anymore.

11:02.561 --> 11:05.860
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.725
Thanks, man.

11:07.967 --> 11:11.061
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

11:11.804 --> 11:14.932
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

11:15.141 --> 11:19.100
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

11:20.146 --> 11:26.312
Oh, so it's a card,
but it's also a poem-holder.

11:29.221 --> 11:33.351
-You have to get our money.
-She couldn't stop crying.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.053
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.691
I know, it's tough.

11:38.898 --> 11:42.129
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

11:42.301 --> 11:44.201
-What?
-Pay the caterer!

11:45.237 --> 11:46.670
I've had a lot of jobs.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.831
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.772
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

11:53.979 --> 11:56.209
...or "l don't know
any of those songs"...

11:56.415 --> 12:00.442
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

12:02.988 --> 12:04.751
So you think she's faking?

12:05.057 --> 12:08.584
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.728
She sounded pretty upset to me.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.599
She seems fine now.

12:24.944 --> 12:28.141
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

12:28.380 --> 12:31.975
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

12:32.284 --> 12:36.084
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

12:37.656 --> 12:40.648
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

12:41.994 --> 12:45.486
And instead of the end of the day,
it's the end of time...

12:45.731 --> 12:47.995
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.563
-Here.
-Wow. Thanks.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.973
So what happened?

12:55.174 --> 12:57.506
Nothing.
I had to get out of there.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.075
Next time, you take her
to your place.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.110
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.583
-What kind of smell?
-I don't know. Soap?

13:08.287 --> 13:11.154
-Listen, you like this girl, right?
-Yeah.

13:11.323 --> 13:12.688
-You want to see her again?
-Yeah.

13:12.925 --> 13:15.655
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

13:16.762 --> 13:18.957
Yeah, okay. You're right.

13:19.665 --> 13:23.101
I mean, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

13:25.271 --> 13:27.671
-It's endearing, really.
-All right!

13:27.940 --> 13:30.875
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

13:40.719 --> 13:44.280
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

13:44.490 --> 13:47.288
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

13:47.459 --> 13:48.448
Any luck?

13:48.627 --> 13:53.030
Yeah, I found this great place
called "lnvisible Things for Kathy."

13:53.299 --> 13:56.132
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

13:56.468 --> 13:59.995
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

14:00.239 --> 14:02.969
...and you get her
something worse than that...

14:03.209 --> 14:04.540
...Iike a regular pen.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.575
She's really going
to love this, you know?

14:09.181 --> 14:11.809
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

14:12.017 --> 14:15.384
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.588
Honey, that's so sweet.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.018
You don't think it's just pathetic?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.089
Oh, "pathetic"!

14:26.699 --> 14:29.259
I've been looking all over for you.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.767
-Where?
-Our place. The hall.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.204
I got something for her.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.450
It's a book.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.545
A book?

14:50.189 --> 14:52.555
Is it a book that's also a safe?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.790
It's a book that's just a book.

14:57.029 --> 15:00.795
It's the Velveteen Rabbit.
It was her favorite as a kid.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.625
So just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

15:03.869 --> 15:07.361
You got it. Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.307
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

15:15.114 --> 15:17.776
No, it came out to an even twenty.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.614
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

15:35.668 --> 15:39.434
-You didn't get the money?
-Maybe I can try at intermission?

15:40.306 --> 15:42.570
You know what?
Let's just go.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.167
We're not leaving till we get paid!

15:45.644 --> 15:47.669
I don't know
who she thinks she is.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.347
I talked to the florist.
She didn't get paid either.

15:50.516 --> 15:56.113
Or the limo driver, or the priest, and he
can get the dead guy damned for all eternity.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.319
Well, I'm not going back out there.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.222
Fine. Enough is enough!

16:03.729 --> 16:05.162
Hey, widow?

16:06.398 --> 16:07.422
Widow?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.490
Excuse me? Excuse me!

16:11.837 --> 16:16.137
Thanks. Clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

16:16.342 --> 16:19.573
But we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

16:19.778 --> 16:21.678
...because you ate that service.

16:21.914 --> 16:26.180
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

16:26.418 --> 16:30.650
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.323
All right. I'll get my bag.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.622
Good.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.168
I'm going to leave some cards here.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.473
Please think of us
for your next event.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.106
So you want to come inside?

17:00.319 --> 17:01.513
Yes.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.555
Yes, I do.

17:15.234 --> 17:18.032
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.427
Guess who?

17:45.564 --> 17:48.089
Department of Sanitation?

17:49.334 --> 17:50.392
It's me.

18:04.950 --> 18:05.939
What?

18:06.452 --> 18:08.044
Oh, Cheryl!

18:30.809 --> 18:34.245
-It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
-Oh, my God!

18:34.480 --> 18:37.074
I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.874
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

18:39.985 --> 18:41.748
It's just a rat.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.785
I did it!

18:47.493 --> 18:50.485
I finished it!
I did it all by myself!

18:50.696 --> 18:52.664
And there's nobody to hug.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.855
Move!

19:01.840 --> 19:03.034
Hey, you guys!

19:03.275 --> 19:05.368
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.009
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

19:10.282 --> 19:11.374
How did it go?

19:11.617 --> 19:15.644
The widow wouldn't pay,
so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.015
I'm a hard-ass.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.293
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

19:23.529 --> 19:26.293
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.991
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.231
We should be partners.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.538
We should be catering partners.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.540
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.009
I cook and you take care
of the money.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.910
It'll be like
I have a wife in the 50s!

19:50.889 --> 19:52.481
How did she like the gift?

19:52.758 --> 19:55.659
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.088
Yeah? That's great.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.626
I got to tell you...

19:58.830 --> 20:01.731
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

20:01.967 --> 20:04.993
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

20:12.144 --> 20:14.009
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.646
You know, Chandler got you
a gift too.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.447
No, he didn't.

20:21.753 --> 20:25.154
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.554
Happy birthday.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.897
I'm sorry.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.035
You really didn't have to.

20:43.208 --> 20:47.577
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.543
No, this is great!

20:51.283 --> 20:54.377
-Thank you, Chandler.
-Oh, yeah.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.119
Want to go to bed?

20:59.024 --> 21:01.185
I'll be in, in a minute.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.890
Don't forget your coupon.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.198
Good night.

21:16.808 --> 21:19.208
Thank you for the gift.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.408
I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

21:24.616 --> 21:27.380
...you don't always
know the exact time.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.049
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

21:33.558 --> 21:34.650
The book?

21:34.893 --> 21:36.451
The Velveteen Rabbit?

21:36.662 --> 21:39.563
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.992
What do you mean?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.593
When Joey gave it to me he said:

21:43.802 --> 21:48.330
"This is because I know you like
rabbits, and I know you like cheese."

21:51.109 --> 21:52.974
Thanks. I love it.

21:53.178 --> 21:56.147
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

21:57.416 --> 22:01.443
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

22:02.187 --> 22:05.486
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.190
Oh, yeah. He's my

22:12.197 --> 22:14.427
He's my best friend.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.632
-Well....
-Good night.

22:27.879 --> 22:31.110
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.926
You don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

22:45.163 --> 22:48.428
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.931
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.104
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.533
So would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

23:04.282 --> 23:06.773
I won't be able to sleep.
