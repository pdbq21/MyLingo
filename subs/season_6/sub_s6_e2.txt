WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:06.169
Did everything go okay
with the annulment?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.738
No problems.
It's all taken care of.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.170
Ross, thank you.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.403
Want to go see a movie?

00:13.614 --> 00:14.603
Yeah, why not?

00:14.815 --> 00:16.305
I'll get my sweater.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.311
Want to hear something weird?

00:21.522 --> 00:22.819
Always.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.584
I didn't get the annulment.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.920
What?

00:29.129 --> 00:30.528
We're still married.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.992
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.331
Do you have any gum?

00:41.375 --> 00:45.277
Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?

00:45.512 --> 00:47.207
We'll be late for the movie.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.277
There's a cab. Taxi!

00:50.017 --> 00:51.609
That's great.

00:51.818 --> 00:54.446
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.850
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.490
The Angelika! Go! Go!

01:01.795 --> 01:03.524
You didn't get the annulment?!

01:03.730 --> 01:05.391
I know.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.368
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:

01:10.571 --> 01:13.096
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"

01:13.273 --> 01:16.572
Yes, in that high voice.

01:16.777 --> 01:21.305
I just don't want my tombstone to read:
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces."

01:21.548 --> 01:25.143
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.

01:25.385 --> 01:28.081
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."

01:29.156 --> 01:33.456
You know? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."

01:34.061 --> 01:37.553
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.

01:37.798 --> 01:41.666
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.732
Woman. Sorry.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.741
Okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.341
Just don't say anything to Rachel.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.570
Rachel is one of my closest friends.

01:54.815 --> 01:58.979
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.423
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.024
Hey, Rach!

02:07.194 --> 02:08.752
What was that?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.588
Sorry. Mix-up.

02:11.698 --> 02:12.995
How was the movie?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.598
I haven't seen it yet.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.963
You'd better hurry.
The Angelika! Go!

02:21.541 --> 02:23.600
The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel

03:02.349 --> 03:04.783
When I move in,
can I get a gumball machine?

03:05.052 --> 03:07.953
Of course. Joey wouldn't
let you have one?

03:08.221 --> 03:11.520
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.619
Did you tell him you're moving out?

03:14.895 --> 03:18.194
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out, "Joey, I have to.."

03:18.432 --> 03:22.368
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with, "go to the bathroom."

03:22.969 --> 03:24.436
He may think I'm sick.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.899
I have to tell Rachel, but....
We just gotta get it over with.

03:29.109 --> 03:32.306
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.709
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.448
-Pretty much.
-All right.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.618
Hey, man, you feeling better?

03:47.594 --> 03:49.255
We have something to tell you.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.559
Oh, my God!

03:51.798 --> 03:53.493
You're pregnant!

03:55.168 --> 03:56.795
No!

04:00.507 --> 04:02.441
Look, Joe, here's the thing.

04:04.478 --> 04:08.244
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.107
I'm gonna be moving out, man.

04:18.458 --> 04:22.622
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.755
Are you okay?

04:24.965 --> 04:27.433
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.831
Like you'd believe that.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.866
This sucks!

04:34.374 --> 04:37.002
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you...

04:37.210 --> 04:40.771
the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.248
Maybe that's now.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.776
If you're gonna move in with him...

04:46.987 --> 04:50.354
I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.750
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.688
He forgets to....

04:55.829 --> 04:57.990
He always, he always....

04:59.099 --> 05:01.033
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!

05:06.373 --> 05:08.204
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey.

05:08.375 --> 05:12.106
Oh, look, here's an article about people
who marry people and don't tell them.

05:12.279 --> 05:15.806
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.107
Have you seen Rachel?

05:19.286 --> 05:21.516
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.182
You're pregnant.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.048
No!

05:27.127 --> 05:28.958
Chandler and I are moving in together.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.754
Oh, that's good!

05:30.964 --> 05:34.695
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.869
What's up?

05:41.808 --> 05:44.242
Chandler and I are moving in together.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.605
Oh, my God.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.474
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend...

05:50.750 --> 05:52.308
shacking up.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.318
That's great. That's great.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.423
Guys, I'm happy too.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.124
Okay, come here.

06:01.127 --> 06:05.723
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.767
I gotta go find Rachel.

06:11.004 --> 06:15.338
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.110
Something bad to tell Rachel.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.316
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?

06:26.586 --> 06:28.850
Can you just lay off, please?

06:29.122 --> 06:33.650
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.952
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.257
You'll have a life, you'll date..

06:40.467 --> 06:44.665
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.668
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy...

06:47.941 --> 06:49.932
Murderer Guy...

06:50.176 --> 06:51.837
and geologists.

06:53.213 --> 06:57.206
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.612
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.846
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?

07:04.057 --> 07:08.391
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.893
You're young.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.293
That's true, I am young.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.333
Well....

07:18.305 --> 07:20.796
Nobody cares about this except you.

07:21.007 --> 07:24.340
This embarrassment thing is
all in your head.

07:25.345 --> 07:28.075
-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
-What?

07:28.348 --> 07:32.444
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.176
But wouldn't you date him?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.447
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.590
Thought you were Rachel.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.862
What gave me away?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.695
I gotta tell her.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.132
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.965
It's official.
We're moving in together.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.573
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!

07:58.778 --> 07:59.802
No.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.139
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.145
The worst day.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.983
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.

08:14.227 --> 08:18.323
Listen, for the first four years
of my work, everybody called me....

08:24.671 --> 08:26.662
-Seriously.
-I believe you.

08:28.274 --> 08:32.108
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.007
So everyone's calling me Racquel.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.943
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.

08:39.619 --> 08:43.146
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.181
What?

08:46.926 --> 08:48.416
All yours, babe.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.455
Have a seat.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.833
Listen, Chandler and I...

08:57.604 --> 08:59.469
are going to live together.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.830
Here.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.337
Oh, my God.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.370
That's so great!

09:10.116 --> 09:12.516
I'm so happy for you guys!

09:12.719 --> 09:13.811
Really?

09:14.120 --> 09:16.384
And that was so sweet of you to ask.

09:16.623 --> 09:20.525
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!

09:22.328 --> 09:23.454
Yes, we are.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.728
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take...

09:27.967 --> 09:30.902
because you know
Racquel can't be late.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.901
He'll work on that.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.373
This is so exciting!

09:40.513 --> 09:42.845
Come and knock on our door

09:45.151 --> 09:47.244
We'll be waiting for you

09:53.560 --> 09:56.552
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.324
First marriage: Wife's hidden
sexuality. Not my fault.

10:01.501 --> 10:04.436
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.398
A little my fault.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.768
Third marriage: They shouldn't
let you get married...

10:11.044 --> 10:13.410
when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.171
Nevada's fault.

10:16.716 --> 10:20.675
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?

10:21.020 --> 10:23.352
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.090
But not while he's still married.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.349
And you, wouldn't you want to date?

10:27.594 --> 10:29.562
I'm not dating at all anymore.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.390
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.099
So I decided that..

10:34.300 --> 10:35.699
Good. Good. Whatever.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.094
And you, Meg?

10:38.304 --> 10:41.102
Well, I don't care about
the divorces, either.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.468
But I wouldn't date him.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.443
Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.

10:47.714 --> 10:51.377
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.744
What?

10:52.919 --> 10:56.514
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl."

10:59.359 --> 11:02.692
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.557
And I have loved her in the past...

11:05.798 --> 11:08.096
but now, she is just my wife.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.530
Phoebe, will you help me out here?

11:12.739 --> 11:15.765
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.

11:16.042 --> 11:20.445
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.143
You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!

11:26.653 --> 11:28.484
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.952
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.456
Now he's using
this three-divorces reason...

11:34.727 --> 11:37.958
because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.665
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.327
Fine. If this is what you think,
forget about...

11:45.572 --> 11:47.096
the whole three-divorce thing.

11:47.307 --> 11:51.641
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.505
She means nothing to me.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.645
Nothing!

11:57.483 --> 12:01.249
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.849
I am so attracted to him right now.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.095
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.254
Soon.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.299
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.834
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.528
Joey's my best friend.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.366
I'm not your best friend?

12:24.777 --> 12:26.108
You just said..

12:27.780 --> 12:29.839
Of course you're my best friend.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.045
Would you tell Rachel?

12:32.719 --> 12:35.449
All right. At least I'm prepared.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.555
Oh, yes.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.290
-They're not for you. Are you upset?
-I am now.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.632
Hey, roomie.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.695
Okay, bye.

12:54.741 --> 12:58.336
There's something important
I have to tell you.

12:58.544 --> 12:59.841
Are you pregnant?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.980
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.982
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.

13:08.554 --> 13:13.582
When I said that Chandler and I
wanted to live together...

13:14.060 --> 13:17.029
we meant alone together.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.230
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.200
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.034
I wasn't clear.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.267
I'm really sorry.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.447
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.411
There's absolutely no rush.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.880
Okay.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.417
Don't you want a cookie?

13:49.362 --> 13:50.522
Sure.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.124
Thanks.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.732
Do you need a tissue?

13:59.772 --> 14:02.297
-Where did you get these?
-I made them.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.238
Oh, God, they're so yummy!

14:08.181 --> 14:10.775
-Okay, whose is this?
-That's mine.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.282
-And what about this? Whose is this?
-That's mine.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.718
Okay, whose dishwashing soap is this?

14:16.889 --> 14:20.222
That was here when we moved in.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.794
Oh, I guess it really is concentrated.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.991
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.033
No more Joey and Chan's.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.467
No more J and C's.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.140
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.

14:40.079 --> 14:43.480
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.549
We won't be able to have
those long talks at night...

14:46.753 --> 14:48.721
about our feelings and the future.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.346
Not once did we do that.

14:52.492 --> 14:56.223
Don't you remember that night,
it was late and I was feeling sick...

14:56.396 --> 15:01.390
and you said
I would feel better tomorrow?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.262
Oh, yeah. I remember that.

15:03.803 --> 15:07.534
I don't know.
I'm just gonna miss living with you.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.732
Yeah, me too, man.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.403
-What the hell is that?
-That's disgusting.

15:17.016 --> 15:20.110
I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.684
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.450
Really well.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.782
Surprisingly well.

15:27.059 --> 15:30.290
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.635
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.769
All I'm asking for is
a little emotion.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.099
Is that too much to ask
after six years?

15:42.375 --> 15:45.105
What, are Rachel and l
not as close as you guys?

15:45.311 --> 15:49.441
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?

15:50.883 --> 15:52.874
When we told Joey,
he cried his eyes out.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.881
I did not cry my eyes out!

15:57.457 --> 15:59.584
Come on, it's like the end of an era.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.726
No more J-Man and Channy's!

16:03.729 --> 16:05.959
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.800
You got married again?

16:15.908 --> 16:16.932
Yes.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.336
So that's your second marriage
in two years?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.912
Yes. Second in two years.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.482
Third, overall.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.983
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years...

16:30.256 --> 16:33.316
and never have I had
so much business from one client.

16:35.261 --> 16:38.094
Why don't you tell me what happened?

16:38.998 --> 16:42.798
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.369
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said...

16:46.639 --> 16:48.470
at the altar
in the second marriage?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.369
Yes, yes, yes.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.676
But I do not love her.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.807
That's better then.

16:57.283 --> 17:00.719
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.045
I see.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.149
Have you considered therapy?

17:07.059 --> 17:10.859
I think just the annulment for today.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.461
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.

17:13.733 --> 17:18.136
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.202
No problem.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.636
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.577
There's no way to do this without her?

17:29.849 --> 17:33.717
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.911
Of course you did.

17:37.823 --> 17:42.192
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.

17:44.030 --> 17:47.158
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.702
I will think about the therapy.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.745
So I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.848
Okay.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.283
No point in dragging it out.

18:07.887 --> 18:11.015
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out...

18:11.223 --> 18:13.350
and us not living together anymore.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.958
What about this? Who gets this?

18:23.202 --> 18:26.933
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.132
-What is that?
-I don't know.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.546
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.814
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.950
Something to remember me by.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.885
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.319
We're gonna see each other
all the time.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.497
But still, it's a big change.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.930
The end of an era, you might say.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.671
Are you okay? You're not blinking.

19:03.909 --> 19:08.073
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.106
Oh, all right.

19:11.984 --> 19:16.148
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.

19:16.455 --> 19:19.288
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.926
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

19:23.129 --> 19:26.530
-What is the matter with you?
-What is the matter with you?!

19:27.967 --> 19:29.525
Why aren't you more upset?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.828
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?

19:33.139 --> 19:35.039
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?

19:35.374 --> 19:38.207
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.539
It's just a little hard to believe.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.714
What's hard to believe?

19:44.950 --> 19:49.148
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?

19:49.355 --> 19:53.451
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.

19:53.693 --> 19:58.130
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.204
It's going to happen.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.037
Chandler will move in here.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.141
-But I..
-I know, just let me finish, okay?

20:12.078 --> 20:15.844
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.573
This is something
that we both really want.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.752
And it is going to happen.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.988
It is?

20:27.159 --> 20:28.490
Really?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.589
Yeah, sweetie.

20:32.364 --> 20:36.266
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.705
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.707
I'm gonna miss you.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.608
I mean, it's the end of an era!

20:49.882 --> 20:51.372
I know!

20:54.854 --> 20:57.254
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, no.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.255
So did you get the annulment?

21:00.459 --> 21:03.587
-I couldn't.
-I knew it. Because you love Rachel.

21:04.396 --> 21:07.365
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated..

21:07.566 --> 21:09.796
Complicated because of the love.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.863
I do not love Rachel.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.039
I'm telling her
about the whole thing...

21:15.274 --> 21:18.539
so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.712
Would I do that if I loved her?

21:20.913 --> 21:23.905
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.379
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?

21:31.557 --> 21:33.923
Oh, what's wrong?

21:35.060 --> 21:37.153
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here...

21:37.429 --> 21:40.125
and I have to move out
and everything is changing.

21:40.332 --> 21:43.824
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.333
Everything's gonna be okay.

21:46.605 --> 21:49.631
-Thank you.
-Of course.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.851
So Ross and Rachel got married.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.846
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.

22:06.358 --> 22:07.950
You think we should hook up?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.290
Oh, we do.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.997
But not just yet.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.459
Really? Well, when?

22:19.471 --> 22:22.406
Well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married...

22:22.708 --> 22:24.903
and be filthy rich, by the way.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.634
But it won't work out.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.471
I know.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.416
Then I'll marry Chandler
for the money.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.086
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.653
Great.

22:38.390 --> 22:40.824
But then we ditch them
and we get married.

22:41.493 --> 22:44.053
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.

22:44.330 --> 22:48.266
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.660
What about Ross?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.997
I don't want to go
into the whole thing.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.172
But we have words and I kill him.
