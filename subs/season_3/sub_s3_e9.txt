WEBVTT

00:04.092 --> 00:05.457
Oh, come on!

00:06.295 --> 00:07.956
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.655
You know, instead of watching
football, you could help.

00:10.866 --> 00:12.163
We know.

00:13.769 --> 00:17.500
Hey, Rachel, you wanna put the
marshmallows in concentric circles.

00:18.941 --> 00:21.933
No, Mon, you want to put
them in concentric circles.

00:22.110 --> 00:24.874
I want to do this.

00:33.522 --> 00:35.683
Every year.

00:36.458 --> 00:37.584
The One With the Football

01:22.838 --> 01:25.136
To the ten, to the five.
Touchdown, Giants!

01:25.774 --> 01:30.837
You know, for once I am gonna sit down
and try to watch one of these things.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.137
Halftime.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.846
Who wants to throw
the ball around?

01:37.019 --> 01:40.011
- Get a little three-on-three going?
- That would be so much fun.

01:40.188 --> 01:43.783
- Can I play too?
- I've never played football, like, ever.

01:43.959 --> 01:46.826
Great! You can cover Chandler.

01:48.030 --> 01:49.793
No, no. I don't really want to play.

01:50.365 --> 01:53.425
You never want to do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

01:53.602 --> 01:57.902
That's not true. I wanted to wear my
bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.

01:58.073 --> 02:01.406
I wanted to start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

02:02.010 --> 02:04.604
Chandler, you have to start
getting over her, all right?

02:04.780 --> 02:08.443
If you play, you get some fresh air.
Maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.

02:08.617 --> 02:12.348
If you don't play, everyone will be mad
at you because the teams won't be even.

02:12.521 --> 02:15.285
- Come on.
- All right, I'll play.

02:15.457 --> 02:18.324
But I don't like you.

02:19.895 --> 02:21.988
- Let's do it! Ross?
- What?

02:22.164 --> 02:24.064
Wanna play football?

02:26.701 --> 02:30.034
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

02:30.539 --> 02:32.632
Says who? Your mom?

02:33.675 --> 02:34.664
- Yeah.
- Yes.

02:36.545 --> 02:38.513
"What do you mean?"
She asks her boyfriend...

02:38.680 --> 02:41.046
...really scared to hear the answer.

02:41.416 --> 02:45.284
Every Thanksgiving, we used
to have a touch football game...

02:45.454 --> 02:47.149
...called the Geller Bowl.

02:47.322 --> 02:49.654
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

02:50.659 --> 02:54.095
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains.

02:54.262 --> 02:57.857
It got kind of competitive,
and one year, Geller Bowl VI...

02:58.033 --> 03:01.434
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.831
It was so not an accident.

03:05.073 --> 03:07.439
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

03:07.609 --> 03:10.578
...her big fat
grandma-arm elbow in my face...

03:10.779 --> 03:12.713
...and just kept running.

03:12.881 --> 03:14.872
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

03:16.785 --> 03:19.583
You did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

03:19.788 --> 03:24.782
...because of the spectacularly
illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.

03:25.961 --> 03:27.189
I won the game.

03:27.395 --> 03:31.263
Oh, yeah? Then how come
you didn't get the Geller Cup?

03:32.434 --> 03:34.368
There was a Geller Cup?

03:35.036 --> 03:37.732
Yes, it was the trophy
you got if you won the game.

03:37.906 --> 03:41.239
But our dad said nobody won that game,
and he was sick of our fighting.

03:41.409 --> 03:44.003
So he took the trophy...

03:49.718 --> 03:51.982
...threw it in the lake.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.745
And was the curse lifted?

03:56.758 --> 03:57.952
Anyway...

03:58.760 --> 04:01.923
...that's why Mom said we were
not allowed to play football again.

04:02.397 --> 04:05.298
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.501
I mean, come on.
It's been 12 years.

04:08.270 --> 04:09.703
Can I see you for a second?

04:14.910 --> 04:18.744
- Wuss!
- All right, we're gonna play.

04:18.914 --> 04:20.438
Wait. How are we gonna get there?

04:20.615 --> 04:22.810
Because my mom
won't let me cross the street.

04:28.290 --> 04:30.383
Pheebs, here you go.

04:31.326 --> 04:32.987
- Okay, let's bring it in.
- Wait.

04:33.161 --> 04:34.321
Honey, throw it to me!

04:34.496 --> 04:35.485
Here you go.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.091
That almost hit me in the face!

04:41.269 --> 04:43.100
All right, we have to pick captains.

04:43.271 --> 04:45.637
And then Tennilles.

04:47.576 --> 04:49.100
Okay, so how do we decide that?

04:49.277 --> 04:51.541
- Well, why don't we just bunny up?
- What?

04:51.713 --> 04:54.113
- Bunny!
- Bunny!

04:54.716 --> 04:57.150
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains.

04:57.686 --> 05:01.554
There must be a place in heaven for people
who hung out with you in high school.

05:02.624 --> 05:05.889
Okay. So I bunnied first,
which means I get to pick first. Joey.

05:06.194 --> 05:08.025
- Thank you.
- Monica!

05:08.196 --> 05:10.027
I'm your best friend.

05:10.398 --> 05:14.835
Sweetie, don't worry,
you'll get picked. Chandler.

05:16.571 --> 05:18.334
- Ross!
- Phoebe.

05:21.977 --> 05:23.672
Sweetie, now I pick you.

05:23.845 --> 05:27.372
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

05:28.116 --> 05:29.583
Okay. All right. So let's see.

05:29.751 --> 05:32.845
Let's play from the trash can
to the light post, right?

05:33.088 --> 05:34.578
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

05:34.789 --> 05:37.451
All right, people, listen.
I've got exactly 28 minutes...

05:37.626 --> 05:39.594
...before I have to baste again.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.887
Wow, just like in the pros.

05:42.631 --> 05:44.030
Come on. Huddle up!

05:44.266 --> 05:47.599
- All right, huddle up right over here!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

05:48.303 --> 05:50.203
Oh, cool! This is my first huddle.

05:51.172 --> 05:52.161
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:52.340 --> 05:55.503
So what do you guys
really think of Chandler?

05:57.145 --> 05:59.773
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

05:59.948 --> 06:01.176
Joey's going to catch it.

06:01.349 --> 06:04.113
- And you and I are going to block.
- What's block?

06:04.286 --> 06:08.689
- I thought you knew what you were doing.
- I thought you meant in life.

06:09.291 --> 06:10.918
Break!

06:11.092 --> 06:14.960
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

06:20.302 --> 06:21.633
Son of a...!

06:22.237 --> 06:24.137
- Come on!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

06:24.306 --> 06:26.968
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

06:28.176 --> 06:29.438
I got it!

06:29.678 --> 06:31.077
Go, go, go!

06:39.821 --> 06:43.518
Score! Seven to nothing!

06:44.225 --> 06:46.455
Okay, honey,
just so that I'm clear on this.

06:46.628 --> 06:50.564
You said in the huddle that if Joey caught
the ball, you'd be the one to stop him.

06:50.732 --> 06:53.257
Now, you didn't.
So is that like a football strategy?

06:53.435 --> 06:56.734
Yeah, it was part of my plan
to fall instantly behind. So...

06:56.905 --> 06:58.167
Come on. Let's go.

06:58.707 --> 06:59.935
Losers walk.

07:00.141 --> 07:02.803
Yeah? Losers talk.

07:02.977 --> 07:05.502
No. No. No. Actually, losers rhyme.

07:07.549 --> 07:08.982
Forty-three.

07:09.150 --> 07:10.276
Seventy-four.

07:14.289 --> 07:15.916
- You wanna go shotgun?
- Yeah.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.391
- Hike.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

07:20.562 --> 07:22.621
Over here! Over here!

07:23.531 --> 07:24.691
I almost caught that one!

07:26.301 --> 07:29.361
Great. Now the score's
7 to almost 7.

07:29.938 --> 07:31.064
Okay.

07:31.239 --> 07:34.367
On this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

07:34.642 --> 07:36.405
- Break!
- Wait. What am I gonna do?

07:36.578 --> 07:37.909
You?

07:38.079 --> 07:39.068
You go long.

07:39.247 --> 07:40.475
Well, how long?

07:40.648 --> 07:43.515
- Until we start to look very small.
- Okay.

07:43.685 --> 07:45.448
Break!

07:46.054 --> 07:47.851
- Hike.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

07:48.022 --> 07:49.512
Switch! Switch! Switch!

08:00.602 --> 08:02.797
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

08:02.971 --> 08:04.939
You are playing American football?

08:05.106 --> 08:09.372
Yeah. Wow! You're, like,
from a whole other country!

08:09.978 --> 08:11.036
I'm Dutch.

08:11.212 --> 08:13.476
Hi, I'm Joey.

08:13.648 --> 08:14.910
I am Margha.

08:15.683 --> 08:18.709
I'm sorry, Dutch.
I didn't get that last little bit.

08:18.887 --> 08:21.515
Hey, Joey, you wanna play
football or... Hi, I'm Chandler.

08:22.123 --> 08:23.522
Hello, Chandler.

08:23.792 --> 08:27.421
Her name is Dutch and also Margha.

08:27.796 --> 08:28.785
Margha.

08:28.963 --> 08:31.227
- Margha.
- Margha.

08:31.766 --> 08:34.030
Mar-hon.

08:35.270 --> 08:36.259
Margha.

08:36.438 --> 08:40.568
Yo, flirty boys.
We're in the middle of a game.

08:40.742 --> 08:43.233
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Come on. Second down!

08:44.145 --> 08:47.239
- Hello? It's third down.
- No, it's not. It's second.

08:48.349 --> 08:50.374
- Wow.
- Wow what?

08:50.652 --> 08:54.554
How it just amazes me
that you're still pulling stuff like this.

08:55.089 --> 08:58.923
- Pulling what? It's second down.
- Okay, it's second down.

08:59.327 --> 09:01.522
Take all the second downs you need.

09:02.363 --> 09:05.025
- I heard that.
- Well, I said it loud.

09:06.868 --> 09:09.098
It is okay if I stay and watch?

09:09.270 --> 09:10.760
I can't go home just yet.

09:10.939 --> 09:16.377
My roommate is forshlocking
a big American businessman.

09:17.545 --> 09:20.571
- Just sit right there.
- Yeah, why don't you stick around?

09:20.748 --> 09:22.375
- Well, that went well.
- I think so.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.551
You know, I was thinking
about asking her for her number.

09:25.820 --> 09:30.553
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself, you know?

09:31.926 --> 09:33.416
No. I was thinking about for me.

09:33.595 --> 09:36.587
As part of that whole getting-over-Janice
thing you talked about.

09:37.232 --> 09:38.529
Oh, yeah. That.

09:39.501 --> 09:41.560
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

09:41.736 --> 09:43.431
Thanks.

09:44.305 --> 09:46.500
Let me have her?

09:46.674 --> 09:49.268
What do you mean?
If you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?

09:49.844 --> 09:52.369
I don't like to say it out loud...

09:53.047 --> 09:54.071
...but yeah!

09:55.283 --> 09:57.547
Don't feel bad, man.
We all have our strengths.

09:57.719 --> 10:02.349
- You're better with numbers and stuff.
- Math? You're giving me math?

10:03.625 --> 10:05.752
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

10:06.027 --> 10:08.393
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

10:12.367 --> 10:15.700
Chandler, I want you to run
a post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie...

10:15.937 --> 10:17.131
Yeah, I know. Go long.

10:17.405 --> 10:21.068
You know, it's like all I'm doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.

10:21.709 --> 10:25.304
Well, you wanna just stay out there?

10:26.180 --> 10:28.307
Can I see that for a second?

10:31.052 --> 10:33.316
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

10:33.555 --> 10:34.783
- I got Chandler!
- Hike!

10:35.056 --> 10:37.957
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.421
Fumble!

10:45.400 --> 10:48.335
What the hell's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

10:49.070 --> 10:51.300
Well, now you have two.

10:52.574 --> 10:55.134
Hey, I am good at math!

10:55.310 --> 10:57.505
That's it. I was still
gonna let you have her.

10:57.679 --> 11:00.477
But now forget about it.
Prepare to feel bad about yourself.

11:00.648 --> 11:04.015
Hey, well, I've been preparing
for that my entire life!

11:04.719 --> 11:06.880
Or something about you that's mean!

11:07.522 --> 11:09.285
All right. Come on, guys. Let's go.

11:09.524 --> 11:11.321
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

11:11.826 --> 11:13.919
Forty-two, 38, hike!

11:14.128 --> 11:15.152
I got it!

11:16.197 --> 11:18.893
Oh, broken boobs!

11:19.534 --> 11:21.434
- Pheebs, run!
- Run, Phoebe, run!

11:22.437 --> 11:24.200
Touchdown! Touchdown!

11:28.343 --> 11:30.538
Hello, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

11:31.012 --> 11:32.707
- After the snap.
- Before the snap.

11:33.014 --> 11:34.208
- After.
- Before.

11:34.482 --> 11:36.177
- Now, does it really matter?
- Yes!

11:36.451 --> 11:39.978
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

11:40.154 --> 11:42.622
Pheebs, that's great.
Doesn't count.

11:42.957 --> 11:45.721
- Does so count.
- Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

11:47.528 --> 11:49.962
Oh, my God!

11:50.531 --> 11:54.365
You know what? That's fine.
Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.

11:54.535 --> 11:57.663
- Oh, okay.
- Dead leg!

11:58.506 --> 12:01.873
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead, all right.

12:02.043 --> 12:04.102
Phoebe, the touchdown
does count. You win.

12:04.979 --> 12:06.571
No!

12:07.448 --> 12:09.507
I'm not going
to go through this again.

12:09.684 --> 12:11.618
I wanna beat you
when you can't blame...

12:11.786 --> 12:15.415
...it on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

12:16.024 --> 12:19.050
All right. Let's just call
this tie score and it's halftime.

12:19.227 --> 12:20.922
First, I don't play with cheaters.

12:21.095 --> 12:23.996
And second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

12:25.967 --> 12:28.299
You know what? I think you'll play.

12:29.103 --> 12:30.695
Oh, really? Why's that?

12:30.872 --> 12:32.737
Because the winner gets this.

12:32.907 --> 12:35.535
The Geller Cup!

12:37.979 --> 12:42.473
Is everybody else seeing a
troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

12:42.650 --> 12:44.743
Okay, good.

12:47.789 --> 12:49.620
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

12:49.891 --> 12:52.121
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

12:52.427 --> 12:55.225
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

12:55.430 --> 12:56.454
That cup is mine!

12:56.631 --> 12:59.862
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

13:00.068 --> 13:03.162
All right. So are we not
having dinner at all?

13:03.838 --> 13:06.398
Hey, could you please
set the timer, Margha?

13:06.574 --> 13:08.508
Okay, Beefy.

13:11.379 --> 13:15.247
Come on, Phoebe, let's go. Come on,
it's time to get serious. Huddle up.

13:15.616 --> 13:17.447
Joey, keep your head in the game.

13:17.719 --> 13:21.086
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

13:22.423 --> 13:26.052
Look, if I take Chandler out of the
running, will you be able to focus?

13:26.227 --> 13:29.025
- What are you gonna do?
- Just make sure he catches the ball.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.357
- I'll do the rest.
- Okay.

13:30.798 --> 13:33.232
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay, come on.

13:34.268 --> 13:36.099
- Go, Chan...
- I got it!

13:36.270 --> 13:37.259
Come on! This way!

13:37.438 --> 13:38.427
Hi!

13:38.740 --> 13:39.729
Look out!

13:43.945 --> 13:47.039
Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't
see that every day, do you?

13:49.317 --> 13:50.716
What's with the tackling?

13:51.185 --> 13:52.174
What?

13:52.720 --> 13:54.620
I just touched him and he went over.

13:55.323 --> 13:58.781
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.894
Let's get ready to rumble!

14:41.769 --> 14:44.033
- Go, go, go!
- Get her! Get her!

14:47.942 --> 14:49.671
I love this game!

14:52.713 --> 14:54.010
Hey, where'd you get that?

14:54.749 --> 14:56.614
I went really long.

14:57.952 --> 14:59.817
Forty-two to 21.

14:59.987 --> 15:03.081
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

15:04.058 --> 15:07.255
No surprise. You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.363
You're pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

15:10.531 --> 15:11.964
...because I'm better than you?

15:12.633 --> 15:16.034
Oh, what a great argument.
Exhaling!

15:16.704 --> 15:18.535
You know what? I'll prove it to you.

15:19.006 --> 15:22.601
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

15:22.777 --> 15:26.338
Oh, that's great.
There goes my last shred of self-esteem.

15:26.647 --> 15:29.980
What? The guys against the girls?

15:30.151 --> 15:33.746
See that's ridiculous, Monica, because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

15:33.921 --> 15:35.582
Oh, then bring it on!

15:35.823 --> 15:39.088
Unless, of course, you're afraid
you might lose to a bunch of girls.

15:41.329 --> 15:44.730
Fine. Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

15:44.999 --> 15:47.729
I cannot believe you are trading me.

15:47.902 --> 15:49.665
You are going to lose.

15:49.837 --> 15:52.499
And you are going to lose.

15:52.673 --> 15:54.072
And...

15:54.242 --> 15:56.210
Help me out.
I've never done this before.

15:56.377 --> 15:57.366
That's good. Lose.

15:57.545 --> 15:58.739
Lose!

16:00.214 --> 16:03.615
Come on. Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

16:03.784 --> 16:05.445
You're gonna let me play?

16:05.887 --> 16:07.787
All right, then!

16:08.189 --> 16:10.020
The game is over? We eat now?

16:10.191 --> 16:12.182
The game's not over.
We're switching teams.

16:12.360 --> 16:16.626
Yeah. Chandler finds me so intimidating
that it's better if we're on the same team.

16:17.164 --> 16:19.029
All right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.462
Hold on a second, Joe.

16:21.535 --> 16:23.196
Where do Dutch people come from?

16:31.045 --> 16:36.039
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

16:36.651 --> 16:38.676
And the other Dutch people?

16:38.953 --> 16:41.547
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

16:41.722 --> 16:43.690
Nice try.

16:43.858 --> 16:46.258
See the Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

16:46.427 --> 16:49.453
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

16:50.364 --> 16:52.264
Oh, my.

16:52.433 --> 16:55.994
Enough with geography for
the insane, okay. Let's play some ball.

16:56.203 --> 16:59.639
- No. I'm not playing with this guy now.
- Fine with me.

16:59.807 --> 17:02.833
Okay, I've had enough of this.
Let's just cut to the chase.

17:03.077 --> 17:05.204
Heidi, which
of my boys do you like?

17:06.213 --> 17:07.202
What are you doing?

17:07.481 --> 17:09.711
What are you doing?

17:10.584 --> 17:12.211
Which do I like?

17:12.386 --> 17:16.254
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

17:16.924 --> 17:19.358
Well, if I had to choose right now...

17:19.527 --> 17:22.257
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

17:23.664 --> 17:25.757
...I would have to say Chandler.

17:26.133 --> 17:27.964
Yes!

17:28.336 --> 17:31.669
Wait a minute. She obviously
didn't understand the question.

17:31.839 --> 17:35.104
Well, why don't you have
Captain Hook explain it to her?

17:36.377 --> 17:38.402
I'm sorry, Joey. That is my truth.

17:38.679 --> 17:42.206
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. I'll-Let-You-Have-Her!

17:42.383 --> 17:45.113
I win! You suck! I rule all!

17:45.386 --> 17:47.445
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

17:51.859 --> 17:56.922
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to no one.

17:57.465 --> 17:59.296
What?

17:59.467 --> 18:01.867
I now find you shallow...

18:02.136 --> 18:04.263
...and a dork.

18:04.438 --> 18:06.201
Bye-bye.

18:07.274 --> 18:10.801
Nice going. You just saved
yourself a couple months of sex.

18:11.712 --> 18:14.806
You know what? It doesn't matter,
because she picked me. Me!

18:14.982 --> 18:16.074
Now I get the dates...

18:16.250 --> 18:20.050
...and you stay home on Saturday
nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!

18:20.654 --> 18:23.418
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

18:23.657 --> 18:26.353
We have no time
and we are losing to girls.

18:26.527 --> 18:28.154
We're not gonna lose to girls.

18:28.329 --> 18:29.762
It's 42 to 21!

18:29.997 --> 18:33.694
This sucks!
I was just up by that much!

18:35.202 --> 18:36.692
Look, let me put it this way.

18:36.871 --> 18:39.305
If we lose, they will never let us forget it.

18:39.473 --> 18:43.409
Okay, and worse than that, they'll never
let the women you date forget it.

18:43.577 --> 18:46.910
Hey! Are we playing football, or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

18:48.749 --> 18:51.843
We have to do this.
We are playing for women everywhere.

18:52.019 --> 18:54.579
Okay, just think about
every lousy date you ever had.

18:54.855 --> 18:57.756
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

18:57.925 --> 19:01.156
Oh, my God! You dated
someone with a glass eye too?

19:02.763 --> 19:06.961
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

19:07.134 --> 19:09.329
Yeah! Kill them!

19:10.037 --> 19:12.403
All right, well,
I want to kill them too.

19:12.573 --> 19:13.938
But they're boys.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.742
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

19:46.807 --> 19:50.140
We still have a minute and a half
left, and we're down by two points.

19:50.311 --> 19:51.608
Two points, ladies.

19:57.017 --> 19:59.247
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

19:59.487 --> 20:00.920
Rachel, you go long.

20:01.088 --> 20:04.819
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

20:04.992 --> 20:06.755
Honey, there's a reason.

20:08.028 --> 20:11.361
Monica, I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something. I can throw.

20:11.532 --> 20:15.298
- Let me throw. This is my game too.
- Come on, Mon. Let her throw the ball.

20:15.503 --> 20:19.234
Rachel, sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

20:19.406 --> 20:20.395
Thank you.

20:20.574 --> 20:21.563
- Break!
- Break!

20:21.976 --> 20:23.773
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

20:24.011 --> 20:26.343
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

20:26.547 --> 20:29.107
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi!

20:34.355 --> 20:35.879
Go, go, go!

20:36.657 --> 20:38.818
Mon, catch!

20:40.327 --> 20:43.854
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

20:44.765 --> 20:47.666
I'm sorry. They were coming at me
and I didn't know what to do.

20:47.835 --> 20:49.894
Thirty seconds left on the timer.

20:50.404 --> 20:53.635
You are the loser!

20:54.942 --> 20:58.434
Okay, okay. So we get
to take that stupid troll thing home.

20:58.612 --> 21:01.581
Come on! Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

21:01.749 --> 21:04.411
- Huddle up!
- Okay.

21:05.753 --> 21:07.721
Oh, this is our last huddle!

21:08.622 --> 21:11.523
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel...

21:11.692 --> 21:12.681
...go long.

21:12.860 --> 21:14.191
Okay.

21:14.428 --> 21:16.293
Break!

22:03.911 --> 22:06.175
I did it! Touchdown!
We did it!

22:09.750 --> 22:14.084
You know? Rachel, funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

22:14.321 --> 22:16.346
So you're 5 feet short.
So...

22:17.358 --> 22:19.258
...we win!

22:20.461 --> 22:21.985
Yes, yes, yes!

22:22.162 --> 22:24.153
Wait, so explain
something to me, though.

22:24.431 --> 22:28.629
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

22:33.907 --> 22:36.398
- Let me in, let me in!
- No way! Let go!

22:36.577 --> 22:39.842
Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman!

22:40.014 --> 22:44.314
Guys, guys, come on. It's Thanksgiving!
It's not important who wins or loses.

22:44.551 --> 22:47.679
The important thing
is, the Dutch girl picked me!

22:49.456 --> 22:53.825
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

22:59.533 --> 23:01.626
We should definitely
play football more often.

23:01.802 --> 23:04.669
Maybe there's, like, a league
we could join or something.

23:04.838 --> 23:07.739
Isn't there, like,
a national football league?

23:08.609 --> 23:11.442
Yes. Yes, there is. They play
on Sundays and Monday nights.

23:11.612 --> 23:14.206
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

23:16.817 --> 23:19.342
This stuffing is amazing.

23:19.520 --> 23:23.012
- Should we should bring them some?
- When they're hungry, they'll come in.

23:23.190 --> 23:26.091
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

23:27.995 --> 23:30.964
How come it's always us
left on the field, holding the ball?

23:31.265 --> 23:35.565
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

23:40.674 --> 23:44.235
Hey, it's starting to snow.

23:48.015 --> 23:51.712
- Give it to me! Let go!
- Let it go! Come on!

23:55.789 --> 23:59.020
There was a time tonight that
I started losing the feeling in my toes.

23:59.193 --> 24:01.127
- I know.
- That's when I realized...

24:01.295 --> 24:04.458
...there's more important things
than beating you at football.

24:04.631 --> 24:06.428
Things like feet.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.229
Yeah, I know. This thing has
caused us too much pain and suffering.

24:10.404 --> 24:12.031
- Yeah.
- It's time.

24:12.206 --> 24:13.901
We'll just call it a tie.

24:14.074 --> 24:16.304
- It's a tie.
- All right.

24:16.477 --> 24:17.466
Here.

24:18.812 --> 24:20.143
Okay.

24:24.451 --> 24:27.284
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:29.623 --> 24:30.851
Pheebs, did you get it?

24:31.024 --> 24:33.254
- Yeah, I got it.
- Oh, great.

24:33.427 --> 24:38.126
Bring it up. There's champagne
in my apartment for the winners.

24:38.298 --> 24:41.734
- Ross! What are you doing down here?
- Nothing.

24:45.406 --> 24:46.395
