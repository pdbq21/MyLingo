WEBVTT

00:07.040 --> 00:09.975
None of that.
Not while you're under my roof!

00:12.212 --> 00:16.205
Just because I know about you
doesn't mean I like looking at it.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.181
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition?

00:19.386 --> 00:22.321
I'm sorry I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

00:24.357 --> 00:28.157
I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.

00:30.897 --> 00:33.229
If I pretend to not know about you...

00:33.500 --> 00:36.025
...then you pretend
there's nothing to know.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.659
Sorry.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.478
I can hear that!

00:48.348 --> 00:49.815
Rachel's at work.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.547
I can still hear you!

00:59.325 --> 01:01.190
The One With the Yeti

01:48.241 --> 01:49.333
What's that?

01:49.576 --> 01:53.410
My mom sent me an heirloom
that belonged to my grandmother.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.569
Can you believe it?

01:54.781 --> 01:58.877
A year ago I had no family,
and now I have heirlooms!

02:00.687 --> 02:02.712
The only heirloom I ever got
was a feather boa.

02:02.889 --> 02:06.086
Got if from my dad.
He got it from his dad.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.654
How did I ever get born?

02:19.339 --> 02:20.328
Oh, God!

02:23.443 --> 02:24.842
Soft.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.410
Is this mink?

02:27.881 --> 02:32.750
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

02:33.453 --> 02:37.753
I have a fine coat that no innocent
animals suffered to make.

02:38.024 --> 02:41.118
Just Filipino kids who worked
their fingers bloody...

02:41.361 --> 02:42.726
...for 12 cents an hour.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.222
I made that up.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.866
You can't put up flyers in here.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.072
How come?
Everybody else does.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.477
You can't.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.612
What is that?

03:05.485 --> 03:07.715
I'm getting rid of some things.

03:08.454 --> 03:09.921
This is all of your things.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.982
Yes, it is.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.052
It's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

03:17.297 --> 03:20.266
Stuff that's just ours.
Together. Brand new.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.435
So it's a get-rid-of-anything-
Rachel-ever-touched sale.

03:23.836 --> 03:26.430
Touched, used, sat on, slept on....

03:26.839 --> 03:28.431
I'll take it all.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.642
You're okay with that?

03:31.911 --> 03:33.742
If I can just do what Emily wants...

03:33.980 --> 03:36.744
...and get her to New York,
it will be fine.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.974
Isn't that a little extreme?

03:39.252 --> 03:42.187
After what I did, can you blame her?

03:42.455 --> 03:43.444
You got off easy.

03:43.623 --> 03:46.421
When my friend's husband said
another name in bed...

03:46.626 --> 03:48.992
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.497
I guess I'm lucky Emily is not magic.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.493
Oh, she is.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.433
We all are.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.242
What is he doing?

04:08.481 --> 04:12.645
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

04:13.553 --> 04:14.815
Calm down, Joey.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.113
Everything's getting all messed up!

04:17.323 --> 04:18.984
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.986
We won't stop seeing Rachel.

04:21.227 --> 04:24.128
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.623
I hate this.
Everything's changing.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.595
We're losing Ross.
Joey said "hence."

04:33.773 --> 04:38.233
I'm not happy about this either,
but if Ross says he's happy...

04:38.478 --> 04:41.447
...then we have to keep
our feelings to ourselves.

04:41.648 --> 04:42.979
Are you cool with that?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.584
But, you know, I'm an actor.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.415
I'll act cool.

04:51.924 --> 04:55.690
Probably be some of the hardest acting
I've ever done.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.760
Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.830
Storage rooms give me the creeps.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.340
Please hurry up, honey.

05:12.011 --> 05:15.344
If you want little round waffles,
wait till I find the iron.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.376
I want the little round waffles.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.276
Here it is!

05:21.354 --> 05:24.084
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

05:24.290 --> 05:28.784
Is the best place to put something
that cooks food underneath poison?

05:30.263 --> 05:32.788
You know what?
I'll have toast.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.928
Fog him! Fog him!

05:45.378 --> 05:47.573
I don't know what to do
about this coat.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.270
I'll take it.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.383
That might work.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.284
What do you think?

05:59.559 --> 06:01.754
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.990
No, it's just a bit sudden.

06:07.233 --> 06:10.134
It's great, okay?
I am totally onboard.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.503
I love you too.
All right, bye.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.303
What's the matter?

06:17.577 --> 06:19.909
Nothing. No, actually...

06:20.179 --> 06:21.840
...great news!

06:22.081 --> 06:24.106
I just spoke with Emily...

06:24.317 --> 06:27.411
...and looks like I'm moving
to a new apartment.

06:29.956 --> 06:30.945
Why?

06:31.257 --> 06:33.885
Her thought is, and I agree...

06:34.193 --> 06:38.391
...fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

06:38.598 --> 06:40.463
Her cousin has a place to sublet.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.464
It's got a view
of the river and Columbia.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.934
That's way uptown!
That's three trains away...

06:46.139 --> 06:47.572
...which is great!

06:47.840 --> 06:50.070
I love to ride that rail.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.440
You're okay with this?

06:53.679 --> 06:56.341
It's kind of far from work...

06:56.582 --> 06:59.813
...but I'll get so much done
on the commute.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.687
I've been given the gift of time.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.817
That's so funny. Last Christmas
I got the gift of space.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.924
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.430
Now he's moving?

07:17.670 --> 07:20.537
Man, what is Emily doing to him?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.770
He's not even here!

07:25.511 --> 07:26.637
You guys!

07:27.046 --> 07:30.709
We were in the storage area,
and we saw this creepy man.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.146
It was this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.288
It was like a Big Foot
or a yeti or something.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.620
He came at us,
so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.195
I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.657
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?

07:50.736 --> 07:52.363
Yeah, you fogged Danny.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.867
Please! We did not fog Danny.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.475
Who's Danny?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.574
Danny just moved in.

08:00.847 --> 08:05.409
He just got back from a four-month
trek in the Andes. Nice fella.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.548
He's nice.
You know, you always...

08:09.188 --> 08:11.850
...stick up for the people we fog.

08:23.269 --> 08:27.501
You might not remember us,
but we're the girls that fogged you.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.400
We're really sorry we fogged you.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.909
Just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.349
We thought you were
like a yeti or something.

08:53.966 --> 08:58.801
Sorry to bother you, but we can't
accept your acceptance of our apology.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.768
It doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

09:08.648 --> 09:09.876
That guy is so rude!

09:10.116 --> 09:12.414
Really!
What is with that guy?

09:12.785 --> 09:14.980
You'd forgive me if I fogged you.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.086
You did, a little bit.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.792
Oh, my God, honey.
I'm so sorry.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.285
-I totally forgive you.
-Really?

09:30.169 --> 09:33.502
You know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

09:33.739 --> 09:36.105
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

09:36.809 --> 09:40.506
He said he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

09:40.746 --> 09:44.238
...if I bring in the next person
I know who dies.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.478
Oh, my God!

09:49.655 --> 09:51.953
Oh, my God.
Look at these pelts!

09:53.192 --> 09:56.161
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.633
You're quirky, and I get a big kick
out of it. We all do.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.134
But if you destroy
a coat like this...

10:06.339 --> 10:09.502
...that is like a crime
against nature.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.171
Not nature. Fashion!

10:12.645 --> 10:14.044
This is fashion?

10:14.413 --> 10:16.745
So to you, death is fashion?

10:16.949 --> 10:18.041
That's funny.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.114
Here's Phoebe...

10:20.886 --> 10:24.219
...sporting cutting-edge
hairy carcass...

10:24.423 --> 10:28.826
...from, you know, the steel traps
of wintry Russia.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.090
You really think this looks good?

10:32.598 --> 10:34.395
Because I do!

10:41.140 --> 10:43.370
I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.100
I love you. Bye.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.305
What is in here, rocks?

10:47.947 --> 10:50.848
No, it's my collection
of fossil samples.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.911
So, rocks.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.326
I'll miss this apartment.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.630
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.331
Remember when I ran into this
and it knocked me out?

11:15.141 --> 11:16.665
I love this place.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.876
To tell the truth,
I wish I didn't have to move.

11:20.780 --> 11:25.274
Are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

11:25.484 --> 11:27.975
If Emily gave me a choice

11:28.187 --> 11:30.280
You do have a choice!

11:30.823 --> 11:33.951
Why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

11:35.695 --> 11:39.358
It's not right what Emily wants
you to do. She's totally

11:39.965 --> 11:41.694
Stop pinching me!

11:42.234 --> 11:46.568
You guys said to keep my mouth shut
if Ross was happy, right?

11:47.473 --> 11:50.909
He just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.068
What's going on?

11:54.847 --> 11:55.973
We all hate Emily!

11:59.351 --> 12:01.649
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

12:02.021 --> 12:04.888
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

12:05.157 --> 12:07.057
...a whole lot to make her happy.

12:09.261 --> 12:13.357
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.533
Yes, unreasonable.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.832
Unreasonable?

12:18.437 --> 12:21.600
How about we have this conversation
when one of you marries?

12:22.441 --> 12:25.774
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.605
It's compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

12:28.881 --> 12:29.905
Do you do it? Yes.

12:30.116 --> 12:33.449
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

12:33.686 --> 12:35.244
...coffee at Central Perk.

12:35.521 --> 12:36.920
It's real life, okay?

12:37.223 --> 12:40.351
It's what grownups do.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.127
I think he's right.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.862
You guys hang out at
the coffeehouse way too much.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.545
-I feel so guilty about Ross.
-I know.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.412
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.382
Kind of?

13:08.053 --> 13:10.613
You should have kept this to yourself.

13:10.990 --> 13:15.927
I'm keeping so many things to myself,
something was bound to slip out!

13:17.396 --> 13:19.887
I think it's very brave
what you said.

13:22.067 --> 13:25.798
I can't sit here anymore.
I have to walk places.

13:26.105 --> 13:29.233
What's with the coat?
How about the animal rights thing?

13:30.609 --> 13:33.100
I've been reading up,
and for your information...

13:33.379 --> 13:35.176
...minks aren't very nice.

13:36.816 --> 13:42.379
-So they deserve to be killed?
-Well, they are real bad.

13:44.223 --> 13:46.885
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?

13:47.092 --> 13:51.495
It's the best thing I ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.393
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.142
So you like the short hair better?

14:16.455 --> 14:18.116
Yeti? Danny?

14:20.092 --> 14:22.686
I had to cut my hair to get rid of...

14:23.128 --> 14:24.595
...the fogger smell.

14:25.631 --> 14:29.260
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you...

14:29.468 --> 14:31.868
...if you hadn't looked so....

14:33.339 --> 14:36.775
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.165
What?

14:38.477 --> 14:39.466
It's cool.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.309
No, that is not cool.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.981
You don't even know me.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.151
You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalog.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.315
From that, you've got me
all figured out?

14:51.790 --> 14:53.018
Well, you don't.

14:53.225 --> 14:57.525
You know, I could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

14:58.497 --> 14:59.623
Do you?

14:59.999 --> 15:03.560
You know, if kids like to play
with capri pants.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.299
Stop saying that.
I hate that!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.556
I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.

15:24.757 --> 15:29.023
But you did it too, and you're worse.
You're sticking to your judgment.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.662
You can't even open your mind to see
you might be wrong.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.355
What does that say about you?

15:35.434 --> 15:38.028
That pizza place
across the street any good?

15:39.238 --> 15:41.172
I'm hungry.
You want some pizza?

15:41.373 --> 15:42.840
You can keep yelling.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.437
Stop saying that.
I hate that.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.545
Are you still mad?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.258
Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.517
You know what?
I'm not in the mood.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.121
Look, Ross.

16:05.931 --> 16:10.095
I feel really bad.
You're going through all this stuff...

16:10.302 --> 16:12.463
...and I just acted like a jerk.

16:12.705 --> 16:16.607
-We are so sorry.
-You're stepping on the song.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.373
We were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.638
Whatever you decide,
whatever you do.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.949
Now you're just taking lines
out of the song.

16:27.419 --> 16:32.049
This is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.385
Yes, exactly! And that's why....

16:36.662 --> 16:41.156
Why don't you come over tonight,
and I'll make your favorite dinner.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.434
Thanks, you guys.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.562
Are you wearing fur?

16:48.774 --> 16:50.799
Let's get some perspective, people.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.309
It's not like I'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat!

16:57.616 --> 17:02.679
You know, I think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.679
You do, huh?

17:04.923 --> 17:05.912
You see...

17:06.091 --> 17:07.854
...I'm an actor, right?

17:08.360 --> 17:12.091
So I got to keep my emotions
right at the surface.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.656
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you know?

17:17.436 --> 17:22.499
It's tough. Guys like me,
you wander around, you're alone.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.971
What are you talking about?

17:27.312 --> 17:28.939
I'm not sure.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.011
Look at you!
Where have you been?

17:33.285 --> 17:34.946
I went to have pizza.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.644
With Danny.

17:37.489 --> 17:41.016
-What happened?
-That yeti is one smooth talker.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.629
Yetis are smooth-talkers. That's why
you never see any pictures of them.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.664
"Come here, baby. Give me the camera."

17:49.001 --> 17:51.799
I hope you're not full.
Dinner's almost ready.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.132
I think I'll probably
just hang out in my room.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.329
Why?

17:56.642 --> 17:57.734
Come on, you guys!

17:58.143 --> 18:02.045
If Emily knew I was having dinner
with you, she'd flip out.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.046
It's okay.
I really don't mind.

18:07.319 --> 18:10.152
Wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.050
Please.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.924
It would mean a lot for me
if you stay.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.484
Ross, I just

18:17.729 --> 18:21.187
Please, just have dinner with us!

18:22.835 --> 18:24.359
Settle down.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.038
All right. I'm sorry.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.331
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.911
Hey, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's back.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.046
We haven't seen him in so long.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.744
Oh, God! I really missed
that fat bastard.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.191
This is so weird.

18:50.395 --> 18:54.126
I realized this may be
the last time we hang out together.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.102
It's almost as if he knew.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.271
I'll get it.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.711
Hi, Emily.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.772
You tracked him down.
Hold on.

19:16.121 --> 19:18.817
Yeah, we're just having dinner.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.917
Sure, hold on.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.651
She wants to say hi.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.125
Hi, Emily!

19:28.400 --> 19:29.833
Hello, everyone.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.127
So who am I saying hello to?

19:32.404 --> 19:35.168
Well, I don't know
about who's here...

19:35.407 --> 19:39.104
...but I can tell you who's not here,
and that's Rachel!

19:41.180 --> 19:45.241
I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.313
You know what?
Rachel is here.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.248
She's there?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.483
Oh, yeah, there she is!

19:57.196 --> 19:59.130
She's here.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.127
Take me off speakerphone.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.293
How could you do this to me?

20:05.938 --> 20:08.805
I made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear.

20:09.041 --> 20:13.034
I'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

20:13.378 --> 20:17.542
-You can't keep away from her.
-That's ridiculous.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.950
-Hello? Hello?
-Who is this?

20:21.853 --> 20:24.720
It's Ross. What are you doing?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.256
Sorry, dude, I had to make a call.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.255
Joey.

20:34.433 --> 20:38.961
Joey, they don't have two lines,
they have two phones.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.303
Gotcha.

20:43.375 --> 20:47.903
I'm sorry. Emily, listen.
I have never cheated on you.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.244
I'm moving for you. I'm cutting
friends out of my life for you.

20:52.517 --> 20:56.783
Please, get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

20:57.055 --> 20:59.421
You're the only one
I want to be with.

20:59.691 --> 21:03.889
I'll feel better when I'm there.
I can know where you are all the time.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.930
You can't know where I am
all the time.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.398
This marriage will never work
if you don't trust me.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.602
You're right.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.642
Can you trust me?

21:33.258 --> 21:35.055
I think it's going okay.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.056
Looks like he's smiling.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.129
How can you tell?
You can only see his back.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.557
You can totally tell!

21:42.968 --> 21:44.435
Here, look, watch me.

21:45.570 --> 21:46.559
Smile.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.296
Frown. Smile.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.933
Frown.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.234
Smile.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.623
I guess that's it.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.093
Why? What happened?

22:09.961 --> 22:11.826
My marriage is over.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.024
Look at you, you're shivering.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.334
Here.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.769
Honey, is there anything we can do?

22:30.649 --> 22:33.482
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.270
Stop tormenting me!

22:56.808 --> 23:00.972
This is mink, okay? They're mean,
and they hate squirrels.

23:01.246 --> 23:04.238
Most of these probably
wanted to be coats.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.314
Fine. No, I get it.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.542
Here.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.211
You take it.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.554
Are you happy now?
I'm cold!
