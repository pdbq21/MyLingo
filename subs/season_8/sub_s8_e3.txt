WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.400
Aren't you excited we're going
on our honeymoon?

00:04.571 --> 00:05.833
Yeah, I am.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.740
That's right, get it out of your system
while we're alone.

00:12.679 --> 00:16.547
-Hey. We came to say goodbye.
-Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.548
-Thanks.
-I better go pack.

00:18.719 --> 00:22.416
No, I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

00:25.526 --> 00:29.257
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

00:29.429 --> 00:33.798
I'm gonna go pack my regular,
long bathing suit.

00:35.802 --> 00:39.499
Good, you're still here! I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.197
Thank you!

00:41.375 --> 00:45.573
And I also wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.675
What? What?

00:53.420 --> 00:56.821
-We know it's Ross.
-How? How do you know?

00:56.990 --> 00:59.982
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

01:00.527 --> 01:04.463
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I am so relieved that you guys know!

01:04.631 --> 01:07.156
That is so great. And I'm gonna be
your baby's aunt!

01:07.334 --> 01:08.528
I know.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.260
Me too!

01:10.671 --> 01:13.640
And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

01:14.241 --> 01:18.610
-You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
-Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.

01:19.947 --> 01:25.715
So now that you all know, you can help me.
Give me some advice on how to tell Ross.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.217
What were you gonna say?

01:27.421 --> 01:31.755
I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have it,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.654
Well, that sounds good.

01:33.827 --> 01:38.287
Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
I mean, what's the first thing that I say?

01:41.902 --> 01:45.338
-Okay, great. Thanks.
-Hey, good luck.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.234
Yeah, bye.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.004
Hey, what was that all about?

01:50.177 --> 01:54.477
Guess there's no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.

01:54.648 --> 02:00.348
What?! I didn't even know that..!
Why didn't you tell me?

02:00.787 --> 02:03.187
Why am I talking like this?

02:04.758 --> 02:08.159
-I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
-What?!

02:10.464 --> 02:11.863
What?!

02:12.633 --> 02:15.898
I am an excellent secret-keeper.
I have kept all our secrets.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.802
-What secrets?
-No, no, Joey.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.999
I'm not gonna tell you, because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.209
-You'll tell me later?
-You already know.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.317
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.860
You know, Monica and Chandler are
married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

03:19.032 --> 03:24.436
-Maybe you and I should do something.
-All in good time, my love. All in good time.

03:26.673 --> 03:31.007
Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later, right?

03:31.178 --> 03:33.669
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

03:33.847 --> 03:38.910
-What? They took mine to give to you.
-Why would they take away our keys?

03:39.086 --> 03:40.576
Maybe they don't trust us.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.689
They let me keep my key the last time
they were out of town.

03:43.857 --> 03:48.726
The time you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.795
-Hey, I washed those.
-No, you didn't.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.297
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

03:55.202 --> 03:59.502
-What will I do? I really need my guitar.
-I have stuff in there too.

03:59.673 --> 04:04.201
-What stuff?
-Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of it.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.173
Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

04:08.348 --> 04:12.682
Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency!

04:14.387 --> 04:17.481
Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.185
-Hey, did Monica and Chandler take off yet?
-Yeah.

04:23.764 --> 04:28.497
Damn. They left without my pass to the
Nassau Fossil and Natural History Museum.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.464
There goes the honeymoon.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.205
-Did Rachel find you?
-No, why?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.039
She was looking for you.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.145
Well, I guess I'll catch up
with her later.

04:40.814 --> 04:45.649
-She really wanted to talk to you now.
-Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.646
Oh, no.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.256
What?

04:51.925 --> 04:54.792
I think I might know what this is about.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.194
Really?

04:58.398 --> 05:03.893
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this, but..

05:04.905 --> 05:08.864
About a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.876
And?

05:14.681 --> 05:17.912
Wow, I thought you'd be
a little more shocked.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.976
Oh, sorry. And?!

05:24.825 --> 05:29.228
Well, we said we'd just do it
that one time..

05:29.396 --> 05:33.298
but now I think she may wanna
start things up again.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.162
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

05:37.137 --> 05:42.131
-Why? What else could it be?
-Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.072
I'm telling you, that's what it is.

05:47.247 --> 05:51.343
No wonder she was looking at me
all funny during the wedding.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.513
She didn't say anything to you?

05:54.754 --> 05:57.382
-Maybe it's something you ate.
-Could be, yeah.

05:57.958 --> 06:02.156
-Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
-Yeah, I guess I should.

06:04.564 --> 06:07.055
Man, you know what I have to realize?

06:07.234 --> 06:12.001
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

06:12.973 --> 06:17.774
You know, they always seem
to want a little bit more.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.439
I should remember that.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.718
Next.

06:33.526 --> 06:37.223
-They're kissing. Let's just go around them.
-Leave them alone. They're in love.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.833
I'm in love too. But in an orderly fashion.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.366
Next.

06:42.535 --> 06:46.335
Hi. Can you do that and walk?
Because she said, "Next."

06:46.840 --> 06:51.436
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

06:51.611 --> 06:57.675
Let me see what I can do.
There are some first-class seats available.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.480
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon!

07:01.655 --> 07:06.149
-Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
-We are on our honeymoon.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.089
Grab my ass.

07:09.496 --> 07:12.522
-Next.
-Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.

07:12.699 --> 07:17.068
You know, I'm just so in love with my new
husband. We're on our honeymoon.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.102
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

07:19.272 --> 07:24.471
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

07:24.644 --> 07:29.343
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing and bump us to first class?

07:29.516 --> 07:33.282
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken.
That couple got the last two.

07:33.453 --> 07:39.187
See? If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!

07:39.359 --> 07:43.159
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

07:51.471 --> 07:55.430
I still can't believe they took away my key.
I mean, you trust me with yours.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.168
Of course I do!
And I'm gonna get it back to you..

07:58.345 --> 08:02.042
just as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.946
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.422
Treeger, what are you doing?

08:11.591 --> 08:14.321
-You said there was a gas leak.
-Why not use your key?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.952
By the time I found it on this thing,
the whole place might have exploded.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.794
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will ask questions.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.629
Come on, hurry up!

08:26.639 --> 08:28.971
Well, we could have done that.

08:31.878 --> 08:35.245
Look at that! They're going
into the first-class lounge.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.440
-Do you know what they have in there?
-No.

08:37.617 --> 08:39.949
Me neither. We have to get in!

08:41.855 --> 08:45.586
-Just act like you belong.
-Oh, my God! Oranges!

08:47.560 --> 08:52.054
-Nice to see you again.
-Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

08:52.832 --> 08:54.561
Yes, of course.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.262
Would you move your thumb?
I can't see the seat number.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.498
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

09:04.177 --> 09:08.136
-Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
-Apology accepted. Excuse us.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.648
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.087
Fine.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.750
Go, go!

09:31.371 --> 09:32.861
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.501
Hi.

09:35.975 --> 09:39.206
I think there's something
that we really need to talk about.

09:39.379 --> 09:43.440
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.

09:49.189 --> 09:53.888
-Look, I know why you're here.
-You do?

09:54.060 --> 09:57.257
Yeah, and to save you
from any embarrassment..

09:57.430 --> 10:00.365
I think maybe I should talk first.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.966
-Okay.
-Okay?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.911
Ross and Rachel.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.105
Rachel and Ross.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.845
That's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.385
What?

10:25.058 --> 10:31.327
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

10:31.498 --> 10:35.958
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.237
Seriously, what?

10:40.673 --> 10:44.040
Okay. You know what?

10:44.244 --> 10:48.977
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

10:50.917 --> 10:55.286
I mean, I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now..

10:55.455 --> 10:56.547
Okay.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.690
You know what? Can I talk now?

10:58.858 --> 11:00.758
-Oh, sure.
-Okay.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.929
I'm pregnant.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.837
Ross?

11:19.712 --> 11:21.145
Ross?

11:22.148 --> 11:25.015
Okay, whenever you're ready.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.993
And you're the father, by the way.
But you got..

11:39.666 --> 11:43.625
-Can I get you some water?
-I'm good.

11:44.270 --> 11:50.300
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? I
mean, you can be as involved as you want.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.174
Yeah, I..

11:56.349 --> 11:59.785
I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand..

12:01.921 --> 12:03.912
how this happened.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.885
-We used a condom.
-I know.

12:10.063 --> 12:15.194
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.229
What?

12:19.439 --> 12:21.031
What?!

12:22.242 --> 12:25.973
Well, they should put that on the box!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.008
-They do.
-No, they don't!

12:37.123 --> 12:41.389
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

12:41.561 --> 12:46.931
-Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.
-Well, I may as well have!

12:48.768 --> 12:51.532
Listen, you know what?
I was really freaked out too..

12:51.704 --> 12:54.502
-when I found out.
-Freaked..? Hey, I'm not freaked out.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.940
I'm indignant as a consumer!

13:00.380 --> 13:04.680
-You know what? Let's talk later.
-No, I wanna talk now.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.012
In fact, I wanna talk..

13:07.186 --> 13:11.350
to the president
of the condom company.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.958
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should come back.. Okay.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.526
Yeah, I'll press one!

13:21.467 --> 13:27.099
-I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
-So then I can heat this up?

13:27.774 --> 13:30.072
Anyway, I'll get moving
on that new door.

13:30.243 --> 13:35.203
Great. Listen, could you do us a favor and
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

13:35.381 --> 13:39.078
Because, you know, they don't have
any kids of their own..

13:39.252 --> 13:42.551
and this door was like a child to them.

13:43.756 --> 13:47.055
Well, I'm gonna have to put on a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

13:48.528 --> 13:53.488
It's looking like an all-day job.
I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.

13:53.866 --> 13:57.199
Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga class today?

13:57.370 --> 13:58.632
Sure.

14:04.043 --> 14:08.036
-Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
-So it's noticeable, huh?

14:08.581 --> 14:12.176
-Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
-Didn't you two already talk?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.910
Yeah, but..

14:14.921 --> 14:18.357
Okay. Look, you guys know
that Rachel and I slept together..

14:18.524 --> 14:20.583
but there's something else.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.994
Rachel's pregnant.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.996
-Holy mother of God!
-Oh, my God, I can't believe that!

14:30.136 --> 14:34.732
-With my child.
-That is brand-new information!

14:39.112 --> 14:42.206
-You already know, don't you?
-Little bit.

14:42.982 --> 14:46.782
-How you doing?
-Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.444
It's just, I don't think
I handled it very well.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.954
-What'd you say to her?
-Nothing.

14:52.125 --> 14:56.255
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.796
-Then when I turned around, she was gone.
-Oh, Ross.

14:59.966 --> 15:05.802
I know. But in my defense, I just found out
that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.736
-What?
-I gotta go find her.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.843
Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?

15:12.011 --> 15:15.139
So, like, 3 percent of the time,
they don't even work?

15:16.649 --> 15:19.345
They should put that on the box!

15:20.486 --> 15:23.216
-Evidently, they do.
-What?!

15:29.028 --> 15:30.859
Well, I'll be.

15:38.704 --> 15:42.196
-I can't believe we're here.
-You've gotta be kidding.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.933
What?

15:45.812 --> 15:49.771
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the honeymoon suite.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.112
No! You have been screwing us all day!

15:53.686 --> 15:57.747
-Who are you?
-We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

15:59.358 --> 16:03.317
You already got the first-class tickets,
the lounge. We should get free stuff too!

16:03.496 --> 16:06.056
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

16:07.667 --> 16:12.070
You can have the suite if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.638
We're here to celebrate our love
for each other.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.641
We don't have to get free stuff.
We just want to be together.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.806
We need the stuff.

16:26.552 --> 16:30.545
Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I smell gas
coming from your apartment.

16:30.723 --> 16:35.422
-What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
-What else is new?

16:35.862 --> 16:40.822
-We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
-Well, do something. Get in there!

16:41.000 --> 16:45.460
-How? I guess I could break down your door.
-Yeah, do that.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.869
-And you won't blame us for any damage?
-No.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.542
-Are you doing it? I don't hear anything.
-Okay, I'll break it down.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.910
Hi. He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.827
Okay, we're in.

17:12.632 --> 17:17.626
-Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
-If I said I was, would you judge me?

17:17.937 --> 17:20.405
The doctor'll be here in a minute
to do your sonogram.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.665
Okay.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.681
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these
at Pottery Barn..

17:32.018 --> 17:33.679
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.377
We need to talk.

17:35.555 --> 17:40.424
Right now? Because I kind of got
an alfresco situation going on over here.

17:40.860 --> 17:45.024
Please, I really.. I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier today.

17:45.197 --> 17:49.031
-That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
-What? Oh, yeah, sorry.

17:49.201 --> 17:54.901
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you..

17:55.074 --> 17:57.338
-Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!
-Right.

17:57.510 --> 18:02.072
I want you to know that I'm gonna be there
through this whole thing. Okay?

18:02.248 --> 18:07.413
The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze
classes, baby-proofing the apartment.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.215
Although, we can worry about that
after we get married.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.014
-Married?
-Well, yeah, I think we should get married.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.161
Because that's your answer to everything?

18:18.297 --> 18:21.164
No. Because that's the right thing to do.

18:21.334 --> 18:26.931
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But Ross, we are not in love, are we?

18:27.106 --> 18:32.738
No. But still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.476
Excuse me?

18:34.647 --> 18:40.176
-You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
-What?

18:40.353 --> 18:44.255
If you can't eat by yourself, how do you
expect to have a baby by yourself?

18:44.423 --> 18:48.018
-I can too eat by myself!
-When have you ever?

18:48.194 --> 18:52.858
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

18:53.032 --> 18:56.524
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup!

18:56.702 --> 18:58.966
Oh, please. You inhale your food.

18:59.138 --> 19:03.165
I grew up with Monica.
If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

19:06.579 --> 19:07.876
Am I interrupting?

19:08.047 --> 19:11.710
No, Dr. Long. Please come in.
This is Ross. He is the father.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.411
But not the husband, because,
evidently, she can do this alone.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.757
Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.931
-Why you can't admit you need me?
-I need you to stay near my head!

19:28.601 --> 19:33.937
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.968
Here's your uterus..

19:37.143 --> 19:41.239
and right here is your baby.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.716
Oh, my God.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.254
There it is. I see it.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.860
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.291
-Okay.
-Thank you.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.932
Pretty amazing, huh?

20:07.306 --> 20:09.604
I don't see it!

20:17.683 --> 20:21.676
-What?
-I can't see it.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.179
But you just said that you did.

20:24.356 --> 20:27.917
I know. I lied. I didn't want her
to think I was a terrible mother.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.891
I can't even see my own baby!

20:30.062 --> 20:36.092
Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.006
Oh, it's beautiful.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.869
I see it now.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.440
-Do you really?
-No, I don't see it!

20:51.684 --> 20:54.710
Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.

20:54.887 --> 21:00.348
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.121
Yeah.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.825
Sweetie, that's it.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.025
That's it?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.761
Well, I saw that.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.242
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

21:21.614 --> 21:26.176
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.952
Yeah, that's our baby.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.058
Well, they put up the new door.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.292
-So it's all locked up and secure?
-Yeah. Why?

21:44.670 --> 21:48.936
I was trying to figure out how bad
I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.269
-Hi.
-Hey.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.675
-So how was the doctor?
-Everything went great.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.375
-Good.
-Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.188
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

22:07.359 --> 22:11.193
Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right..

22:12.731 --> 22:14.961
Ross, I lost it again.
