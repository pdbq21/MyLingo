WEBVTT

00:21.287 --> 00:23.346
Monica?

00:24.691 --> 00:25.885
What time is it?

00:26.426 --> 00:27.586
Nine.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.327
But it's dark out.

00:32.065 --> 00:35.728
That's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.367
This is what nine looks like.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.936
I guess I'll get washed up then.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.067
Watch that sunrise.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.078
I'm getting tired of always
sneaking around.

00:50.283 --> 00:54.583
Me too. What if we went away
for the weekend? No interruptions.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.779
We could be naked
the entire time.

00:57.424 --> 01:00.359
All weekend?
That's a whole lot of naked.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.929
I'll say I have a conference
and you can have a chef thing.

01:05.131 --> 01:08.123
I wanted to go to this
culinary fair in Jersey!

01:08.368 --> 01:10.461
Okay.
You know you're not, though.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.432
-Let's go.
-Okay. Wait.

01:13.706 --> 01:15.071
What about Joey?

01:25.718 --> 01:27.447
The One with the Kips

02:11.197 --> 02:15.133
I'm going to a culinary fair
in Jersey this weekend.

02:15.368 --> 02:19.031
How weird! Chandler just said
he's got a conference there.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.708
That's funny. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

02:24.944 --> 02:26.639
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.213
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

02:32.619 --> 02:36.578
Do you want people to think it's fake?
It's a real conference.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.589
-ls Rachel here?
-No, she's out shopping.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.119
-Damn!
-What's going on?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.821
I told Emily to come.

02:47.066 --> 02:51.264
And I just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.129
Wait a minute.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.571
When Emily comes,
you won't see Rachel anymore?

02:57.710 --> 03:00.873
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part...

03:01.080 --> 03:03.981
...and not on the part
that makes me do this.

03:07.053 --> 03:09.613
So you'll never be
in a room together?

03:09.822 --> 03:11.517
How will that even work?

03:11.758 --> 03:13.589
I have no idea.
I mean....

03:13.826 --> 03:16.886
But I assure you,
I will figure it out.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.495
It doesn't seem like it'll work.

03:23.670 --> 03:24.864
Hi, guys.

03:26.439 --> 03:27.497
What's going on?

03:28.675 --> 03:31.007
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

03:33.613 --> 03:37.674
So I'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up and then we flip it.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.280
That's better than my way.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.581
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.416
Oh, man.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.255
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.931
So, Rach?

03:57.870 --> 04:00.065
You know how Emily's coming?

04:00.273 --> 04:01.900
Oh, yeah. I know.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.766
Can you hear anything?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.969
Yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

04:11.985 --> 04:14.112
Hey, Joey's ass.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.578
What are you doing?

04:17.824 --> 04:20.224
Remember when they fought
and broke up...

04:20.426 --> 04:23.486
...and we were stuck here
all night with no food?

04:23.730 --> 04:27.996
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,
I figured it'd happen again.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.264
So I hid this in here.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.067
Candy bars, crossword puzzles....

04:33.273 --> 04:35.138
Mad Libs! Mine!

04:36.809 --> 04:39.505
-Okay, "Name of someone in room."
-Chandler.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.407
Come on, seriously.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.542
What do you got in here?
Magazines, Doritos

04:47.687 --> 04:49.587
Condoms?

04:51.357 --> 04:54.190
You don't know how long
we'll be in here.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.586
We may have to
repopulate the Earth.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.729
And condoms are the way to do that?

05:03.803 --> 05:07.295
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

05:07.640 --> 05:12.168
-The last time I talked to Emily
-Oh, my God! Our dog died!

05:13.179 --> 05:17.013
-What?
-Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!

05:19.786 --> 05:22.516
LaPooh's still alive?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.392
Sorry.

05:26.526 --> 05:31.259
It says he was hit by
an ice cream truck and dragged for...

05:31.531 --> 05:33.658
...nineteen blocks!

05:35.835 --> 05:38.770
-Oh, my God.
-Sweetie, we heard you crying.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.836
-Please don't cry.
-It's LaPooh!

05:42.141 --> 05:45.440
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.446
I can't believe it! We're here!

05:55.855 --> 05:58.517
Chocolates on the pillows!
I love that!

05:58.725 --> 06:01.626
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.357
This is so great.
No one's gonna bother us.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.261
And we're gonna do it.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.994
I'm gonna do it with Monica!

06:11.871 --> 06:15.136
Chandler, stop yelling
that you and I are gonna do it!

06:16.242 --> 06:17.903
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.781
Oh, yes!

06:25.651 --> 06:28.586
Get in here.
There's a high-speed car chase on!

06:28.988 --> 06:30.615
We're switching rooms.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.551
Oh, dear God!
They gave us glasses!

06:34.127 --> 06:36.561
The glasses have lipstick on them.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.287
Who knows what else
they didn't change?

06:39.432 --> 06:42.265
You wanna switch rooms
because they didn't switch the glasses?

06:42.402 --> 06:46.133
I didn't wanna say anything,
but the carpet smells too.

06:47.106 --> 06:52.442
I want this weekend to be perfect.
We can change rooms, can't we?

06:53.079 --> 06:57.072
Okay, but let's do it now.
Chopper Five just lost its feed!

07:11.798 --> 07:13.595
Forget it.

07:19.238 --> 07:23.971
You know how there was something
I wanted to talk to you about?

07:24.143 --> 07:25.303
Oh, yeah.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.345
I'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.283
Well, there's this...

07:34.520 --> 07:36.454
...one thing.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.083
Here goes.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.630
I made a promise that

07:46.532 --> 07:48.363
-What?
-Your nose is bleeding.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.125
-Oh, God!
-You're bleeding.

07:51.370 --> 07:55.033
Oh, not again. This happened when
my grandfather died.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.600
Sorry.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.470
Gross.

07:58.678 --> 08:02.136
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you want to tell me?

08:10.289 --> 08:11.654
Sorry. Sorry.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.529
I can't see you anymore.

08:18.865 --> 08:22.665
I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either. All right.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.829
I'm just gonna go shove
a bunch of tissues in my nose.

08:26.973 --> 08:30.204
Hey, do you wanna tell me while I do that?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.004
I'm good.

08:34.547 --> 08:38.278
-I think you'll like this room more.
-Okay, great.

08:41.487 --> 08:43.284
They say he's only got
half a tank left.

08:43.422 --> 08:48.951
Half a tank? Still lots
of high-speed chasing to do!

08:49.095 --> 08:52.360
-I'll bet he's heading for Canada.
-They always do.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.390
-We're switching rooms again.
-What? Why?

08:55.568 --> 08:58.901
This has a garden view.
We paid for an ocean view.

08:59.138 --> 09:03.541
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.536
-The carpet smelled.
-Like ocean?

09:07.446 --> 09:09.937
No, like feet.

09:11.217 --> 09:15.153
Excuse me. Can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

09:21.460 --> 09:25.123
These clowns want to take us
for a ride. I won't let them.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.298
We're not a couple of suckers.

09:28.534 --> 09:29.694
I hear you, Mugsy.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.071
All these rooms are fine.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.866
Just pick one so I can watch the

09:36.108 --> 09:39.805
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

09:42.949 --> 09:45.918
Oh, man, he almost hit a gas truck.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.646
Do you ever watch Baywatch?

09:55.962 --> 09:59.796
-This one I like.
-Nothing. Nothing. It's over. Damn it!

09:59.932 --> 10:02.992
This is regularly scheduled
programming!

10:03.135 --> 10:07.037
-I wanted to see them talk to his neighbors.
-Well, I'm standing right here...

10:07.173 --> 10:10.734
-...you could talk to me.
-You didn't know him.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.111
Can we turn the TV off?

10:13.312 --> 10:16.076
Do we really want to spend
the weekend like this?

10:16.248 --> 10:19.411
Am I getting in the way
of the room-switching fun?

10:20.353 --> 10:22.184
Don't blame me for tonight.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.515
Who should I blame?
The nice bellman?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.191
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

10:28.427 --> 10:31.328
...from Albany to Canada
on half a tank of gas?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.663
Do not speak ill of the dead.

10:36.369 --> 10:40.362
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.833
What's the matter?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.666
I just want to watch
a little television.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.674
Jeez, relax, Mom.

10:49.682 --> 10:50.842
What did you say?

10:51.550 --> 10:54.713
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

10:57.123 --> 11:02.618
You know what, Chandler?
You like fast getaways? Watch this.

11:02.762 --> 11:07.358
I don't like fast getaways,
I like car chases.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.169
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey.

11:20.413 --> 11:24.713
I've been wanting to tell you something
and I just have to get it out.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.408
Okay. What's up?

11:26.552 --> 11:29.043
Okay, before I tell you
I just have to know...

11:29.188 --> 11:31.918
...is your nose okay?

11:32.091 --> 11:35.891
Are all the other family pets in good health?

11:36.028 --> 11:39.623
Well, Davey's still pining after LaPooh...

11:39.765 --> 11:42.529
...but, you know, he's a tough little turtle.

11:45.137 --> 11:49.301
You know how you said to do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

11:49.475 --> 11:52.603
Yeah, I told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

11:53.746 --> 11:58.740
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

12:02.655 --> 12:06.591
...is for me not to see you anymore.

12:08.861 --> 12:13.696
That's crazy! You can't do that.
What are you going to tell her?

12:19.205 --> 12:21.036
Oh, my God!

12:22.174 --> 12:24.335
You've already agreed to this.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.270
It's awful, I know.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.678
But I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

12:31.884 --> 12:36.321
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.397
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

12:48.667 --> 12:52.535
Lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

12:52.738 --> 12:56.071
That's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

12:58.978 --> 13:03.881
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. This is so hard.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.480
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

13:06.685 --> 13:10.451
-Let me make this easier for you.
-What are you doing?

13:10.656 --> 13:12.886
-Storming out.
-It's your apartment.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.583
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

13:28.007 --> 13:29.770
Damn Rolos!

13:31.610 --> 13:34.204
You're back!
How was your conference?

13:34.446 --> 13:38.678
It was terrible. I fought with
my colleagues the entire time.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.681
Are you kidding with this?

13:42.021 --> 13:43.750
So your weekend was a bust?

13:43.889 --> 13:47.120
No, I got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

13:47.259 --> 13:52.322
You know, at the Taj Mahal
he has his own private glass elevator.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.955
That's right. Made by Otis Elevators.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.591
And they don't usually do glass.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.037
What kinds of stuff do you know?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.976
You're back too.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.575
Could I talk to you for a second?

14:07.813 --> 14:10.839
-How was your chef thing?
-lt was awful.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.643
Some people don't
appreciate good food.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.615
Maybe the food tasted good at first...

14:16.856 --> 14:19.916
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.465
How much was the room?
I'll pay my half.

14:30.669 --> 14:31.693
Fine. $300.

14:31.971 --> 14:32.960
$300?

14:33.172 --> 14:35.265
Just think of it as $25 per room.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.541
What are you guys woofing about?

14:42.147 --> 14:44.547
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

14:47.353 --> 14:50.322
I was only stealing it back,
the one that she stole from me.

14:50.456 --> 14:53.584
Stealing and now lying.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.822
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

14:57.029 --> 15:00.157
...I constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

15:00.366 --> 15:02.197
...always have lots.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.904
You should've seen
the look on her face.

15:10.175 --> 15:13.667
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

15:13.879 --> 15:16.006
-You want my advice?
-Yes. Please.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.873
-You won't like it.
-That's okay.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.982
You got married too fast.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.989
-That's not advice.
-I told you.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.159
I'm going to the bathroom.

15:32.898 --> 15:37.198
If anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I couldn't do it.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.325
Me neither.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.269
Maybe I could do it.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.775
I know you guys heard about
me and Ross.

15:49.048 --> 15:53.451
But I've been obsessing about it
and would love not to talk about it.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.779
I don't know if this falls
under that category...

15:57.022 --> 15:59.115
...but Ross is right back there.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.022
-That's not Ross.
-Not that guy.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.058
He does look like him, though.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.360
Ross is in the bathroom.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.569
Oh, my God! It's happening.
It's already started. I'm Kip.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.931
Yeah, you're not Kip.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.401
Do you even know who Kip is?

16:17.376 --> 16:19.810
Who cares? You're Rachel.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.546
Who's Kip?

16:23.916 --> 16:26.441
My old roommate.
We all hung out together.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.586
Oh, that poor bastard.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.950
You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

16:33.225 --> 16:37.423
When they broke up, you all
promised you'd stay his friend.

16:37.629 --> 16:40.257
And what happened?
He got phased out.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.128
-You won't be phased out.
-Of course I am.

16:43.335 --> 16:47.795
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your college roommate.

16:47.940 --> 16:51.000
Kip didn't even have to be Kip.
We handled that all wrong.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.440
It was a long time ago.

16:52.578 --> 16:58.448
And it was before you and me were around.
They didn't know what they were doing.

16:58.584 --> 17:03.044
Chandler had a mustache,
for crying out loud.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.217
It was just a matter of time.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.359
I just assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.963
You live far away,
you're not related.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.633
You lift right out.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.467
Hey, Mr. Bing.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.641
That hotel you stayed at called.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.749
Someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.082
Yes, that was mine.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.820
I figured you met
a girl and she left it.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.758
That would have made more sense.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.797
I don't even feel like
I know you anymore.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.327
All right, I'm just going
to ask you this one time.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.938
Whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

17:57.342 --> 18:00.140
Were you or were you not...

18:00.345 --> 18:01.835
...on a gay cruise?

18:20.999 --> 18:23.866
I'm sorry about the whole
"lifting out" thing.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.768
You gotta come with me.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.540
-Where?
-Wherever I go.

18:29.808 --> 18:33.209
You and me, we'll start a new group.
We're the best ones.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.107
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.453
Phoebe, do you mind if l
speak to Rachel alone?

18:46.692 --> 18:47.886
Sure.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.224
Bye, Ross.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.897
Forever.

19:00.405 --> 19:03.374
Why are you here?
Isn't this against the rules?

19:06.044 --> 19:07.204
I talked to Monica.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.483
Look, I'm the one
who made the choice.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.380
I'm the one who's making
things change.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.090
So I should be the one to,
you know, step back.

19:19.358 --> 19:22.327
No, no, it's okay. Really.

19:22.628 --> 19:26.462
Plenty of people just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving...

19:26.732 --> 19:29.394
...their college roommates
at reunions...

19:29.635 --> 19:32.502
...and Joey at Burger King.

19:37.609 --> 19:38.667
Is that better?

19:42.481 --> 19:44.278
No, it's not better.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.845
I still don't get to see you.

19:50.422 --> 19:54.119
What would you do?
If you were me, what would you do?

20:02.701 --> 20:05.864
First, I'd have said
the right name at my wedding.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.975
I can't believe this.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.378
I know.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.711
I am so sorry.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.120
I know that too.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.223
Hey, Rach?

20:36.468 --> 20:40.871
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said
you want to talk to me about a trip?

20:49.848 --> 20:51.975
I just came over to drop off...

20:52.551 --> 20:53.848
...nothing.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.921
So that weekend kind of sucked.

21:00.659 --> 21:01.921
Yeah, it did.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.720
So I guess this is over?

21:06.932 --> 21:10.561
You know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.103
Why exactly?

21:13.372 --> 21:15.602
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.341
Chandler, that's crazy.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.774
If you always gave up
after a fight...

21:22.080 --> 21:24.708
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than

21:32.057 --> 21:33.285
This isn't over?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.091
You are so cute!

21:39.731 --> 21:42.461
No, no. It was a fight.

21:42.701 --> 21:46.933
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.366
Really? Okay, great!

21:51.810 --> 21:54.540
Welcome to an adult relationship.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.751
We're in a relationship?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.788
I'm afraid so.

22:12.731 --> 22:15.825
I heard you saw Donald Trump
at your convention.

22:16.101 --> 22:18.160
Saw him waiting for an elevator.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.164
Can I use your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.808
It's in the bathroom.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.179
Can I talk to you for a second?

22:48.300 --> 22:49.494
Yes.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.599
Yes.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.169
You?

22:54.306 --> 22:55.432
And you?

22:56.675 --> 22:59.109
But you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.175
But how? When?

23:01.680 --> 23:04.012
-lt happened in London.
-ln London!

23:06.718 --> 23:10.484
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

23:10.722 --> 23:14.385
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!

23:16.228 --> 23:17.252
You can't.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.730
-Please. Now, I know this is hard.
-lt is. It hurts.

23:24.169 --> 23:27.195
We just don't want to deal with
telling everyone.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.874
Please just promise you won't tell.

23:33.445 --> 23:34.673
All right.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.015
Man, this is unbelievable!

23:39.251 --> 23:41.116
I mean, it's great!

23:41.353 --> 23:42.945
But....

23:43.188 --> 23:44.450
I know. It's great!

23:46.057 --> 23:48.184
I don't want to see that!

23:51.530 --> 23:53.395
We're so stupid.

23:54.032 --> 23:58.196
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!

24:03.241 --> 24:07.371
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe.

24:07.746 --> 24:12.149
If you win, slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!'"

24:13.051 --> 24:15.884
That's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.213
-But it doesn't count.
-For what?

24:18.390 --> 24:21.791
Just count in our heads
as good Mad Libs.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.129
-I gotta go.
-Fun's over.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.958
Wait, if we follow the rules...

24:28.166 --> 24:30.498
...it's still fun
and it means something.

24:30.735 --> 24:32.100
I'm going to take off.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.397
Guys, rules are good!

24:34.639 --> 24:36.607
Rules help control the fun.
