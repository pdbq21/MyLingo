00:05.219 --> 00:09.596
Out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

00:11.237 --> 00:13.810
Probably Monica and Chandler.

00:16.004 --> 00:18.578
Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?

00:18.822 --> 00:22.749
We don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

00:22.997 --> 00:25.570
That'd be great. Thanks.

00:27.381 --> 00:31.450
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

00:32.843 --> 00:36.426
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?

00:38.410 --> 00:40.177
What's up?!

00:41.227 --> 00:44.347
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

00:44.568 --> 00:46.929
What's up with you?

00:47.143 --> 00:49.681
Why don't I tell you over here?

00:50.621 --> 00:54.998
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.012
Poor Ray-Ray.

00:57.719 --> 00:59.866
Oh, no. It's all good.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.002
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

01:03.216 --> 01:07.214
I will not. I'm the divisional head
of men's sportswear.

01:07.461 --> 01:11.067
Shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

01:11.323 --> 01:13.790
- Oh, please.
- Are you?

01:14.140 --> 01:15.456
No.

01:16.228 --> 01:19.774
We have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:19.986 --> 01:23.664
- Tomorrow. I don't know.
- You're having dinner with me.

01:24.474 --> 01:26.098
Shut up.

01:26.318 --> 01:29.544
I've gotta go.
This has been so great.

01:29.797 --> 01:33.925
Oh, there you are.
You're a bad man for giving me these.

01:34.181 --> 01:37.337
- So listen, just call me. Here's my card.
- Oh, wow, thanks.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.960
- You're in real estate?
- No, that's an old card.

01:41.139 --> 01:43.322
I got out of that to do something...

01:43.610 --> 01:47.429
...where I could help people
and make a difference.

01:47.645 --> 01:49.198
What do you do now?

01:49.698 --> 01:51.501
I'm a party planner.

01:52.202 --> 01:55.049
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

01:56.135 --> 01:59.254
Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.

02:00.379 --> 02:03.333
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

02:03.579 --> 02:06.426
She seems really, really fun!

02:07.268 --> 02:10.814
She's actually sweet,
and we used to be very close.

02:11.025 --> 02:15.438
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you...?

02:15.653 --> 02:18.226
Who you what? Who you what?

02:19.445 --> 02:21.426
- Yes.
- Wow!

02:21.637 --> 02:24.104
Wow, what? Who you what?

02:24.316 --> 02:26.569
Oh, it's not a big deal.

02:26.786 --> 02:27.960
They were lovers.

02:28.178 --> 02:29.874
- What?
- What?

02:30.091 --> 02:31.965
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

02:32.143 --> 02:35.821
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

02:36.075 --> 02:40.868
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

02:41.050 --> 02:42.474
...kissing for a bit.

02:42.685 --> 02:44.974
So that's two of my wives.

02:46.896 --> 02:47.999
Where are you going?

02:48.182 --> 02:51.029
To bring her back here!
Ross, get the sangria!

02:52.810 --> 02:57.044
The One With Rachel's Big Kiss

03:31.985 --> 03:35.591
So this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

03:35.812 --> 03:40.498
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

03:42.145 --> 03:45.691
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

03:45.937 --> 03:48.891
...talking to the cute bartender.

03:51.956 --> 03:54.697
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

03:55.331 --> 03:58.106
The red are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

03:58.288 --> 04:01.242
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

04:01.455 --> 04:04.372
Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

04:04.586 --> 04:06.602
Certainly not a close one.

04:13.701 --> 04:15.255
Hey, Rach.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.605
Stop picturing it!

04:22.260 --> 04:26.946
I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.977
They all look like they're having fun
don't they?

04:30.297 --> 04:33.037
So where are my parents gonna be?

04:33.393 --> 04:36.654
Well, if this is the wedding hall...

04:36.872 --> 04:40.727
...then your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

04:40.907 --> 04:45.036
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

04:45.257 --> 04:47.759
Why would they think they're invited?

04:48.179 --> 04:50.505
You got me. I don't...

04:50.754 --> 04:53.944
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

04:54.163 --> 04:57.188
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's are coming.

04:57.434 --> 04:59.760
Ross' parents are coming.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.450
Ross' parents are my parents.

05:04.114 --> 05:06.546
Well, see, parents are coming.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.921
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

05:11.142 --> 05:12.601
Well, this is just sad.

05:14.551 --> 05:19.202
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

05:19.422 --> 05:21.854
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

05:22.066 --> 05:24.118
That is not a problem.

05:25.372 --> 05:29.085
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Get out of here!

05:32.956 --> 05:37.475
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

05:37.723 --> 05:42.373
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

05:43.394 --> 05:45.576
Thanks a lot for hooking me up.

05:45.794 --> 05:50.421
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

05:52.926 --> 05:55.880
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

05:56.093 --> 05:58.002
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

06:00.128 --> 06:03.082
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

06:03.329 --> 06:07.848
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

06:08.374 --> 06:10.947
- You mean like for award shows?
- Some of them.

06:11.158 --> 06:14.112
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling:

06:14.358 --> 06:16.611
"Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"

06:18.186 --> 06:21.341
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

06:21.560 --> 06:23.707
...and a little less E!

06:25.214 --> 06:27.325
Okay. Who wore those?

06:28.414 --> 06:32.304
- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

06:32.589 --> 06:34.807
This one is Paul O'Neill.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.528
Who's that?

06:38.643 --> 06:42.427
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

06:43.096 --> 06:45.978
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.380
- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?

06:52.594 --> 06:53.733
Are you serious?

06:53.952 --> 06:54.983
007?

06:55.204 --> 07:00.519
This is James Bond's tux? I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

07:01.223 --> 07:02.432
It's a pretty cool tux.

07:02.685 --> 07:06.575
It's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

07:07.521 --> 07:11.447
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

07:12.008 --> 07:15.448
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

07:17.610 --> 07:19.591
Would Monica let me wear this?

07:24.708 --> 07:27.305
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

07:28.117 --> 07:30.169
I like our way.

07:31.561 --> 07:33.020
Chess!

07:35.945 --> 07:37.712
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

07:40.851 --> 07:44.813
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

07:45.060 --> 07:47.207
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

07:47.426 --> 07:51.139
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

07:51.393 --> 07:53.195
And maybe a hat.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.626
- Does Monica know about this?
- No.

07:55.846 --> 07:58.028
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

08:00.752 --> 08:03.184
You want to go to a movie tonight?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.648
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

08:05.865 --> 08:07.004
Can I come?

08:08.858 --> 08:11.918
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

08:12.442 --> 08:15.039
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

08:15.295 --> 08:18.035
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

08:18.252 --> 08:20.268
- Joey's.
- Okay.

08:21.974 --> 08:23.504
I had this college friend...

08:23.714 --> 08:27.712
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

08:27.924 --> 08:31.435
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.

08:32.551 --> 08:34.805
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

08:36.065 --> 08:39.055
- It did.
- Sure.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.645
Hey. It happened.

08:45.702 --> 08:49.771
It was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

08:49.981 --> 08:52.377
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.987
And we ended up kissing.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.552
For several minutes.

08:56.766 --> 09:00.586
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

09:01.741 --> 09:04.374
Why are you taking this away from me?

09:05.116 --> 09:07.405
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

09:07.621 --> 09:11.820
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

09:17.920 --> 09:23.032
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

09:23.521 --> 09:27.792
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're so...

09:28.044 --> 09:28.945
...vanilla.

09:30.340 --> 09:35.168
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

09:35.385 --> 09:38.683
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

09:38.899 --> 09:40.215
To Ross.

09:41.717 --> 09:43.485
If you don't believe me...

09:43.701 --> 09:47.591
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

09:47.806 --> 09:50.202
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

09:50.450 --> 09:53.023
You should get inside my head.

09:58.313 --> 10:00.851
Guess what I got for your wedding?

10:01.096 --> 10:03.634
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

10:04.993 --> 10:08.741
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

10:09.098 --> 10:10.794
Batman's tux!

10:11.534 --> 10:12.886
- What?
- That's right.

10:13.099 --> 10:18.034
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

10:18.317 --> 10:20.749
...that Batman film he was in.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.669
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

10:23.919 --> 10:25.508
- James Bond's tux!
- So?

10:25.763 --> 10:29.477
So? If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

10:29.694 --> 10:32.091
You need something
to make this day special?

10:32.269 --> 10:34.807
Hello! You have
the most special thing of all.

10:35.017 --> 10:38.422
You are marrying the woman you love.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.694
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

10:45.908 --> 10:49.905
"Pretty please?" Not very 007.

10:50.431 --> 10:54.321
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

10:54.536 --> 10:59.092
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

11:03.547 --> 11:06.429
Okay, good, you're here.
All right, I figured it out.

11:06.644 --> 11:09.349
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

11:09.601 --> 11:11.854
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

11:12.071 --> 11:15.096
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

11:15.481 --> 11:17.284
Yeah. They're not coming.

11:19.516 --> 11:20.452
What?

11:20.664 --> 11:24.377
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.019
They feel unwanted.

11:26.231 --> 11:30.193
That's too bad.
It's true. But too bad.

11:30.441 --> 11:32.837
If you could just call my mom.

11:33.050 --> 11:35.932
Just let her know
you want them there.

11:36.147 --> 11:39.516
This is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

11:39.730 --> 11:40.738
No, she hasn't.

11:40.914 --> 11:43.725
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

11:44.253 --> 11:45.569
What am I gonna say?

11:45.784 --> 11:50.411
Tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, blame it on the post office.

11:50.620 --> 11:54.261
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

11:54.691 --> 11:57.396
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

12:00.118 --> 12:05.018
Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani?
This is Monica Geller.

12:05.233 --> 12:09.883
I'm just calling to say that we really
hope you can make it to the wedding.

12:10.103 --> 12:14.101
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

12:14.314 --> 12:17.753
I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

12:19.949 --> 12:21.609
Tell me about it!

12:21.828 --> 12:26.905
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

12:27.464 --> 12:29.967
What are they, Irish?

12:35.988 --> 12:40.959
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

12:41.207 --> 12:43.840
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

12:44.304 --> 12:48.646
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

12:48.862 --> 12:49.798
Oh, well.

12:51.610 --> 12:55.917
- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- That's great.

12:57.386 --> 13:00.055
- Were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

13:00.273 --> 13:03.713
Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.

13:06.675 --> 13:07.684
What one?

13:07.892 --> 13:11.367
We were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

13:11.616 --> 13:15.162
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

13:15.408 --> 13:19.512
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

13:23.410 --> 13:24.762
Anyway...

13:25.219 --> 13:28.339
Speaking of drinking too much,
I told Phoebe...

13:28.559 --> 13:33.185
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.096
What?

13:35.308 --> 13:40.623
Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
on and the coconut bikini tops.

13:40.841 --> 13:44.139
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

13:44.389 --> 13:45.634
...and we made out.

13:46.651 --> 13:51.277
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:51.487 --> 13:53.111
Really?

13:59.106 --> 14:01.324
Ross is Batman.

14:03.489 --> 14:08.045
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

14:08.257 --> 14:12.563
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.

14:12.779 --> 14:15.448
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

14:15.667 --> 14:20.602
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

14:20.850 --> 14:24.919
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

14:26.870 --> 14:32.220
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Batman has Robin.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.897
We get ESPN, right?

14:41.830 --> 14:46.942
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.063
I don't like martinis.

14:49.310 --> 14:52.264
- A Yoo-hoo with a funny straw?
- Yum.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.491
I know the invitation says 6 p. M.

14:58.704 --> 15:02.594
But does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

15:02.844 --> 15:04.268
"The show"?

15:06.393 --> 15:09.939
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

15:10.151 --> 15:13.306
But weddings start
a little late, right?

15:13.699 --> 15:16.237
Have you ever been
to one of my weddings?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.722
Well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

15:20.936 --> 15:23.225
...and I want my parents to see me.

15:23.441 --> 15:27.368
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

15:28.277 --> 15:30.186
The wedding starts at 6.

15:30.399 --> 15:32.831
Okay. I totally hear you.

15:33.079 --> 15:35.819
How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

15:36.871 --> 15:37.974
You'll "vamp"?

15:38.192 --> 15:41.288
Like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

15:41.498 --> 15:45.602
Because in Joey Tribbiani,
you get a minister and an entertainer.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.517
I'm a "ministainer." All right?

15:49.431 --> 15:52.455
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

15:54.684 --> 15:57.638
Oh, please, God. Don't vamp.

15:58.511 --> 16:00.765
Okay, maybe I'll talk to Chandler.

16:00.982 --> 16:04.492
And maybe he'd like to get married
at 007 o'clock.

16:05.991 --> 16:09.431
All right. I will give you
10 extra minutes. That is it.

16:09.679 --> 16:11.624
That's great! Thank you so much.

16:11.871 --> 16:15.346
Well, we're in luck.
The tux fits perfectly.

16:19.665 --> 16:22.654
Chandler, that jacket,
it's way too big.

16:22.865 --> 16:26.578
Oh, that's okay.
The pants are way too small.

16:30.832 --> 16:33.264
I'm sorry, sweetie.
You cannot wear that.

16:33.789 --> 16:36.459
Now this means Ross is gonna be
the only cool one.

16:36.678 --> 16:39.489
Something, by the way,
I never thought I would say.

16:40.192 --> 16:43.287
Dude, take that thing off.
You look like a fool.

16:43.775 --> 16:47.939
Come next door. I got some minister
headdresses I want you to see.

16:50.699 --> 16:53.166
How can you not remember us kissing?

16:53.412 --> 16:58.003
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

16:59.049 --> 17:03.640
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.316
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

17:06.528 --> 17:09.826
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

17:10.703 --> 17:13.064
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

17:13.279 --> 17:16.612
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

17:18.010 --> 17:22.696
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.353
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

17:26.569 --> 17:27.885
No!

17:28.343 --> 17:30.324
- All right.
- Okay, fine.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.982
You don't have to admit it
because I know that it happened.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.517
Okay!

17:36.763 --> 17:39.953
You have to admit it!
We kissed! Say it!

17:40.451 --> 17:43.476
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

17:43.721 --> 17:47.469
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

17:47.931 --> 17:50.398
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

17:50.888 --> 17:52.548
- But she didn't.
- I know.

17:57.672 --> 17:58.988
You carry that around?

17:59.482 --> 18:03.409
Yes. I find it to be
something of a conversation piece.

18:04.491 --> 18:07.552
- Between you and...?
- Gunther.

18:08.598 --> 18:10.056
Why don't we put them on?

18:10.303 --> 18:13.327
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

18:13.572 --> 18:15.969
I would,
but my pants are a little tight.

18:16.217 --> 18:21.187
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

18:21.366 --> 18:22.504
Well, that stinks.

18:22.758 --> 18:26.056
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

18:26.272 --> 18:30.340
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

18:32.360 --> 18:33.570
Let me try it on.

18:34.796 --> 18:38.864
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

18:45.198 --> 18:47.629
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

18:50.452 --> 18:51.768
What's this?

18:51.983 --> 18:54.794
An invitation to
the At First Sight premiere?

18:55.044 --> 18:57.926
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.

18:58.175 --> 19:03.075
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

19:03.429 --> 19:05.160
Let me see that.

19:06.665 --> 19:08.124
Oh, man.

19:08.370 --> 19:13.340
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.307
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

19:17.590 --> 19:20.544
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.972
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

19:23.260 --> 19:28.301
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

19:28.548 --> 19:32.926
I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

19:33.210 --> 19:36.686
They're so happy
to be a part of your special day.

19:37.664 --> 19:39.952
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

19:40.238 --> 19:45.445
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

19:48.798 --> 19:52.546
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

19:52.903 --> 19:55.299
...is for party time.

20:01.392 --> 20:04.997
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.056
It was great meeting you.

20:07.411 --> 20:11.302
And, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because...

20:11.551 --> 20:14.018
...you know, you've gotten weird.

20:15.621 --> 20:17.151
Take care, you guys.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.791
Wait a minute. Okay, look.

20:20.110 --> 20:24.274
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.579
I won't let you take it away.

20:26.860 --> 20:31.237
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...

20:37.576 --> 20:42.059
Oh, my God. You love me.

20:43.037 --> 20:43.974
What?

20:44.255 --> 20:48.039
Of course I remember.
I think about it all the time.

20:48.292 --> 20:52.942
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together...

20:53.893 --> 20:59.279
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love...

21:01.999 --> 21:06.626
Look who's being suddenly shy.

21:06.905 --> 21:09.372
You have to feel what I feel.

21:09.584 --> 21:12.466
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

21:12.715 --> 21:15.977
I'm just a good kisser.

21:16.299 --> 21:18.552
Shut up.

21:19.639 --> 21:21.062
I'm sorry.

21:24.196 --> 21:27.672
You don't have to be sorry.

21:27.989 --> 21:30.943
I'm obviously kidding.

21:31.258 --> 21:35.327
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

21:35.677 --> 21:40.019
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

21:40.235 --> 21:44.577
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

21:45.558 --> 21:47.088
Anyway, I gotta go.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.479
A kiss goodbye?

21:49.768 --> 21:52.472
No? Okay.

22:02.258 --> 22:06.113
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...

22:12.243 --> 22:13.631
What the hell was that?

22:13.844 --> 22:17.177
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.929
- And?
- I've had better.

22:26.995 --> 22:28.490
I found one that fits.

22:28.770 --> 22:33.254
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

22:36.111 --> 22:38.293
Look at you, all handsome.

22:39.208 --> 22:41.010
- Whose is it?
- Does it matter?

22:41.330 --> 22:44.591
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.

22:47.870 --> 22:50.990
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.

22:51.523 --> 22:54.441
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

22:55.211 --> 22:57.120
Diane Keaton.
