WEBVTT

00:03.063 --> 00:04.655
Hi.

00:06.433 --> 00:07.457
Six dollars, please.

00:07.701 --> 00:10.192
Six? I just had it for one night.
It's three.

00:10.437 --> 00:13.998
Eight o'clock's the cutoff,
and it's 8:02.

00:15.709 --> 00:18.405
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

00:19.346 --> 00:22.042
You have to help me out here
because I only have three.

00:22.783 --> 00:24.751
I can help with that.

00:25.786 --> 00:28.949
Oh, my God. Richard?

00:29.723 --> 00:32.283
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:32.459 --> 00:34.154
Your lip went bald.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.556
Thanks.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.300
You look great!

00:41.668 --> 00:42.657
Right.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.896
No, you do. You just...

00:46.406 --> 00:47.395
What?

00:47.608 --> 00:49.769
You got panties stuck to your leg.

00:54.081 --> 00:59.075
That's because I was just grabbing some
things out of the dryer, and static cling.

00:59.253 --> 01:03.917
Or maybe it's because God knew I'd be
running into you and saw an opportunity.

01:04.625 --> 01:05.751
It's good to see you.

01:05.959 --> 01:07.927
It's good to see you too.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.824
The One Where Monica and Richard
are Just Friends

01:59.513 --> 02:01.606
See that guy?
He's in classics now...

02:01.782 --> 02:05.411
...but as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

02:05.586 --> 02:10.216
He'll go up to the counter with Citizen
Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

02:14.795 --> 02:17.229
This is nice. I miss this.

02:17.798 --> 02:19.766
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

02:19.933 --> 02:22.629
We're gonna be here for a while,
so just go back there.

02:22.803 --> 02:25.328
Yeah, we're not judging.

02:30.577 --> 02:32.636
So you want to get
a hamburger or something?

02:32.913 --> 02:34.881
I don't know if that's a good idea.

02:35.082 --> 02:37.778
Look, just friends.
I won't grope you. I promise.

02:38.685 --> 02:40.516
I think it's too soon.

02:40.754 --> 02:43.689
No, it's not too soon.
I had lunch at 11:00.

02:47.361 --> 02:48.589
Yeah, baby!

02:49.763 --> 02:52.459
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

02:52.699 --> 02:54.132
No, thanks. I'm 29.

02:55.769 --> 02:57.498
Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

02:57.704 --> 03:00.138
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

03:00.307 --> 03:03.242
- I don't know. It could be really late.
- Come on. Not again!

03:03.844 --> 03:06.870
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

03:07.047 --> 03:10.016
For every night that you're asleep
before I get home from work...

03:10.284 --> 03:14.345
...I will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

03:14.554 --> 03:18.320
Well, now if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

03:19.526 --> 03:22.017
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:22.195 --> 03:24.629
Look at you.
Since when do you rollerblade?

03:24.865 --> 03:26.696
Since tomorrow.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.264
I met this really cute guy in the park.

03:29.436 --> 03:32.963
And he, like, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

03:33.140 --> 03:36.837
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts of jock stuff.

03:37.177 --> 03:38.769
And what are you gonna do for him?

03:38.945 --> 03:40.105
- I'm gonna let him.
- Okay.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.304
Cool.

03:41.682 --> 03:43.479
- Good morning.
- Hey.

03:43.650 --> 03:45.845
Somebody got in late last night.

03:46.053 --> 03:49.022
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

03:49.556 --> 03:50.716
When did this happen?

03:51.591 --> 03:53.559
Around 8:02.

03:54.494 --> 03:58.794
We talked for a little while, and then
we went out for an innocent burger.

03:58.965 --> 04:01.525
There's no such thing as
an innocent burger.

04:02.336 --> 04:04.463
- Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.502
Monica, what are you doing?

04:06.740 --> 04:09.038
She spent the last six months
getting over him...

04:09.242 --> 04:13.770
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

04:14.781 --> 04:16.772
It's not a date, okay?

04:17.050 --> 04:20.679
I'm just gonna teach him how to make a
lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.948
You might wanna make extra, because
you'll probably be hungry after the sex.

04:27.127 --> 04:29.118
We're not gonna have sex.

04:29.296 --> 04:33.528
Okay, nothing's changed here. He still
doesn't want children, and I still do.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.691
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

04:35.969 --> 04:37.596
Naked friends.

04:42.209 --> 04:43.301
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:43.477 --> 04:45.968
- Do you have any ice?
- Check the freezer.

04:46.146 --> 04:48.614
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

04:48.982 --> 04:51.109
Are you just getting home
from work? It's late.

04:51.284 --> 04:53.479
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

04:53.653 --> 04:56.315
I got to sit in on a meeting
with reps from Calvin Klein.

04:57.023 --> 05:01.221
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie.
She ordered a ton. How was your day?

05:01.728 --> 05:05.960
I discovered I'm able to count all my
teeth using just my tongue.

05:10.404 --> 05:14.101
Why do you have a copy of
The Shining in your freezer?

05:14.441 --> 05:17.501
I was reading it last night,
and I got scared, so...

05:19.579 --> 05:22.207
But you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

05:22.416 --> 05:24.316
Well, safer.

05:24.518 --> 05:29.615
I never start reading The Shining without
making sure we got room in the freezer.

05:30.824 --> 05:32.689
How often do you read it?

05:32.926 --> 05:35.759
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

05:36.730 --> 05:38.425
I read Little Women more than once.

05:38.598 --> 05:40.998
That's a classic. What's so great
about The Shining?

05:41.168 --> 05:44.831
The question should be, Rach, what is
not so great about The Shining?

05:46.606 --> 05:49.837
And the answer would be,
nothing. All right?

05:50.010 --> 05:54.777
This is the scariest book ever. I bet it's
way better than that classic of yours.

05:57.217 --> 05:59.208
We'll just see about that, okay?

05:59.486 --> 06:05.220
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

06:05.392 --> 06:07.223
- All right, you got it.
- All right.

06:07.727 --> 06:10.890
Now, Rach, these little women.

06:12.532 --> 06:14.193
How little are they?

06:14.468 --> 06:17.335
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

06:23.743 --> 06:26.303
You know, I love this fabric.

06:27.881 --> 06:30.782
I think I'm gonna have a suit
made out of this.

06:33.220 --> 06:35.711
Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.

06:35.889 --> 06:37.049
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:37.224 --> 06:39.590
You have lipstick right here.

06:39.926 --> 06:42.451
That's okay. It's mine.
We just kissed.

06:43.230 --> 06:45.892
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

06:46.166 --> 06:48.532
Well, I'm from California.

06:48.902 --> 06:52.201
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

07:02.883 --> 07:06.341
I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.420
Anybody want anything?

07:08.588 --> 07:09.816
- I'll have coffee.
- Me too.

07:09.990 --> 07:10.979
Make that three.

07:11.157 --> 07:13.921
Okay, Ross, why don't you come
with me?

07:18.732 --> 07:20.927
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

07:21.101 --> 07:22.932
Robert's coming out.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.365
What do you mean?
What? Is he gay?

07:31.545 --> 07:33.706
He's coming out of his shorts.

07:36.416 --> 07:37.849
What?

07:38.451 --> 07:40.749
The man is showing brain.

07:45.025 --> 07:48.426
Are you sure? Hold on.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.624
I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

07:51.798 --> 07:53.288
Coffee. We could write it down.

07:53.567 --> 07:56.832
No, no, that won't be necessary.

08:03.410 --> 08:06.709
- Well?
- Yeah.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.974
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Well, I suppose we just...

08:10.150 --> 08:14.018
...try to not look directly at it.

08:15.221 --> 08:17.246
Like an eclipse.

08:21.328 --> 08:24.263
When people compliment me on my
cooking tonight, what do I say?

08:24.431 --> 08:28.231
You say, "Thank you very much."
And then you buy me something pretty.

08:28.501 --> 08:31.061
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

08:31.304 --> 08:34.137
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

08:35.075 --> 08:38.306
This feels very weird.

08:39.112 --> 08:41.410
You touch people's eyeballs,
and this feels weird?

08:41.681 --> 08:46.641
Sure, I touch them, but I spent years
learning not to squish them.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.154
That's my hand.

08:58.398 --> 09:01.856
- Gotta keep squishing.
- The tomatoes are squishing.

09:03.103 --> 09:05.037
You got some on your shirt.

09:05.205 --> 09:06.866
Hold on one second.

09:07.774 --> 09:11.369
Just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

09:11.544 --> 09:14.536
It should do...

09:15.682 --> 09:17.377
...the trick.

09:26.426 --> 09:28.587
What?

09:28.762 --> 09:30.127
You've got some on your pants.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.658
I'll just throw them out.

09:41.775 --> 09:43.834
These little women!

09:47.147 --> 09:48.136
You're liking it?

09:48.314 --> 09:51.806
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

09:51.985 --> 09:54.146
I don't see how he could forgive her.

09:57.290 --> 10:00.384
Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

10:01.061 --> 10:03.655
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

10:09.069 --> 10:11.230
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

10:11.471 --> 10:14.269
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

10:17.243 --> 10:19.336
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

10:20.647 --> 10:23.844
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

10:26.619 --> 10:27.608
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:27.787 --> 10:29.618
How'd the basketball go?

10:29.789 --> 10:34.783
I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

10:35.295 --> 10:36.421
You mean a 3-pointer?

10:36.629 --> 10:39.120
I get more because I'm dainty.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.194
So is there a phone here
I check my messages?

10:43.436 --> 10:45.301
Yeah, in the back.
Do you want a quarter?

10:45.472 --> 10:48.839
No, thanks. I always carry one
in my sock.

11:00.153 --> 11:02.678
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

11:02.856 --> 11:05.051
Hello!

11:08.828 --> 11:11.058
Hi, I'm Joey. We haven't met.

11:11.231 --> 11:13.131
Good to meet you. Robert.

11:17.003 --> 11:18.163
What?

11:19.038 --> 11:22.235
What? You guys, what is going on?

11:22.408 --> 11:25.104
Do you not like Robert?

11:25.345 --> 11:26.676
Why are you laughing?

11:26.846 --> 11:28.871
Calm down.
There's no reason to get testy.

11:34.687 --> 11:37.178
- You guys! Come on!
- We're sorry.

11:37.357 --> 11:43.159
We're sorry. It just seems that Robert
isn't as concealed in the shorts area...

11:43.329 --> 11:44.796
...as one may have hoped.

11:46.099 --> 11:47.361
What do you mean?

11:47.534 --> 11:50.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:50.603 --> 11:55.370
Robert, could you pass me
those cookies?

11:55.875 --> 11:57.604
Sure.

12:02.382 --> 12:05.010
- Ball?
- Yeah.

12:09.589 --> 12:11.614
So how'd the lasagna go over?

12:12.292 --> 12:16.285
Really? Good. So you owe me
three pretty things.

12:17.463 --> 12:20.227
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot
about you too.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.797
Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.

12:25.905 --> 12:27.770
It's a word.

12:30.476 --> 12:33.240
Yeah, I do think it's better this way.

12:33.413 --> 12:35.040
Yeah, we're being smart.

12:35.315 --> 12:37.306
Yes, I'm sure.

12:39.485 --> 12:41.476
You really sure?

12:42.922 --> 12:44.753
I'll call you back.

12:55.702 --> 12:58.068
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

12:59.038 --> 13:02.007
Absolutely. This'll just be
something we do.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.904
Like racquetball.

13:05.912 --> 13:08.142
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

13:09.515 --> 13:13.576
So just out of curiosity...

13:13.853 --> 13:17.345
...do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

13:18.424 --> 13:20.585
Just your dad.

13:22.262 --> 13:24.822
Although that's actually racquetball.

13:24.998 --> 13:28.559
You know, I do have a blind date...

13:28.735 --> 13:31.898
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

13:34.741 --> 13:36.675
Do you want me to cancel it?

13:37.143 --> 13:38.667
No!

13:39.946 --> 13:45.578
No, because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

13:46.486 --> 13:49.944
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

13:51.057 --> 13:52.991
And besides, it wouldn't be
fair anyway...

13:53.159 --> 13:56.526
...because my mother's trying to
set me up with some lawyer.

13:57.063 --> 13:58.155
So who's this lawyer?

13:58.331 --> 14:01.858
No, she doesn't actually have one,
but she's looking.

14:04.837 --> 14:05.826
Hey.

14:06.005 --> 14:07.802
Hey. Don't sit down!

14:07.974 --> 14:12.343
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- Yeah, you bet. And first, here's a gift.

14:16.683 --> 14:18.844
Stretchy pants?

14:19.018 --> 14:20.986
Those are the greatest things
in the world!

14:21.154 --> 14:23.748
If I were you, I'd wear them
every day, every day!

14:25.658 --> 14:28.024
Jeez, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.

14:28.194 --> 14:32.597
But, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

14:32.765 --> 14:36.030
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

14:38.071 --> 14:39.265
I'm sorry.

14:39.439 --> 14:42.169
That's all right. I'll figure...

14:44.377 --> 14:46.709
Hey.

14:46.879 --> 14:48.813
- How's it going?
- Good.

14:48.982 --> 14:51.143
Hey, Rach, how you doing
with The Shining?

14:51.451 --> 14:53.885
Danny just went into room 217.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.749
The next part's the best!
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

14:57.924 --> 15:00.358
No! Come on, you're gonna ruin it!

15:00.693 --> 15:02.786
All right, I'll talk in code.

15:02.962 --> 15:06.420
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

15:07.400 --> 15:09.027
Yeah, that's very cool.

15:09.736 --> 15:13.729
All blank and no blank makes
blank a blank-blank.

15:15.875 --> 15:19.470
No, the end! When Jack almost kills
them all with that blank...

15:19.645 --> 15:21.545
...but in the last second they get away.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.809
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

15:25.985 --> 15:28.852
I can't believe she cracked your code.

15:33.693 --> 15:37.220
All right. Okay. Laurie proposes
to Jo, and she says no...

15:37.497 --> 15:42.093
...even though she's still in love with
him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.

15:43.436 --> 15:47.270
Hey, mine was by accident!

15:47.473 --> 15:52.342
All right. The boiler explodes and
destroys the hotel and kills the dad.

15:54.781 --> 15:56.976
Beth dies.

16:04.524 --> 16:07.015
Beth... Beth dies?

16:08.428 --> 16:12.262
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

16:12.632 --> 16:15.863
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

16:16.069 --> 16:18.264
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've ruined...

16:18.471 --> 16:21.907
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

16:25.711 --> 16:28.703
No. She doesn't die.

16:28.948 --> 16:30.779
Then why would you say that?

16:34.821 --> 16:38.814
Because I wanted to hurt you.

16:40.426 --> 16:43.088
There they are.
I dropped my keys.

16:45.898 --> 16:47.263
Got them.

16:52.405 --> 16:53.531
Hi.

16:54.273 --> 16:56.503
Sorry. I'm sorry.

16:56.776 --> 16:58.835
You would not believe my day.

16:59.245 --> 17:02.806
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

17:03.082 --> 17:07.246
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

17:10.623 --> 17:12.113
What are you smiling at?

17:12.291 --> 17:14.589
I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

17:20.766 --> 17:22.290
Hello.

17:23.002 --> 17:24.936
I love this friend thing!

17:31.944 --> 17:36.142
Robert's gonna be here any second,
so could one of you just tell him?

17:36.716 --> 17:37.842
Please, right now.

17:38.017 --> 17:42.010
Every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

17:43.789 --> 17:44.778
We can't tell him.

17:44.957 --> 17:50.520
You can't go up to a guy you barely
know and talk about his stuff.

17:50.696 --> 17:54.962
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

17:57.937 --> 18:00.872
Why don't you just tell him?
You're going out with him.

18:01.040 --> 18:05.977
Way too awkward. No. I haven't
even seen it with permission yet.

18:06.579 --> 18:09.480
So, what do I do?
Just break up with him?

18:09.649 --> 18:13.107
I don't know. I think this is
an unsolvable problem.

18:13.352 --> 18:15.411
It's a curiette mariah.

18:17.089 --> 18:19.057
Captain Kirk's unsolvable problem...

18:19.225 --> 18:22.160
...as part of his training to be
a Star Fleet commander.

18:22.562 --> 18:24.052
Kobayashi Maru.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.024
What's a curiette mariah?

18:26.199 --> 18:29.635
It's the place with the cheap rooms
where we stayed in Israel.

18:30.503 --> 18:32.095
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:32.271 --> 18:33.431
So you ready for the gym?

18:33.940 --> 18:37.740
They got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

18:38.644 --> 18:41.112
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.239
What?

18:46.686 --> 18:49.120
Okay, listen, Robert...

18:49.555 --> 18:52.820
- Hey, don't we have to...?
- Yeah, we got...

18:59.966 --> 19:05.063
- I think you're really, really great.
- Oh, God. Here we go again.

19:05.338 --> 19:09.775
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

19:12.011 --> 19:15.640
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

19:18.818 --> 19:21.286
I don't know what to say.

19:22.355 --> 19:27.315
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

19:50.616 --> 19:54.950
Really? It's just like
everyone else's apartment.

19:55.121 --> 19:56.986
It's got rooms and walls
and ceilings.

19:57.156 --> 19:59.624
I just wanted to see where you live.
Give me the tour.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.192
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20:02.495 --> 20:04.895
- This is the living room.
- That's nice.

20:06.132 --> 20:07.224
And this is the kitchen.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.699
That's real pretty. Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

20:10.870 --> 20:14.966
The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much
your typical...

20:16.175 --> 20:18.302
...bedroom.

20:18.678 --> 20:22.478
We're still on this side of the door.
But I didn't get to see it.

20:22.715 --> 20:25.479
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.

20:25.651 --> 20:27.380
Thanks for a lovely evening.

20:45.271 --> 20:47.068
So who is she?

20:47.406 --> 20:50.807
That was the blind date
that I told you about.

20:50.976 --> 20:54.173
She called and switched it
from Tuesday.

20:55.514 --> 20:57.379
Did you like her?

20:57.583 --> 21:02.850
I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.687
Well, you seem fine.

21:07.426 --> 21:10.520
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

21:10.763 --> 21:14.494
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

21:14.734 --> 21:17.726
She wants to see your bedroom.

21:24.577 --> 21:26.636
You know what?

21:28.414 --> 21:30.541
What if we're friends...

21:31.384 --> 21:33.318
...who don't see other people?

21:35.955 --> 21:37.923
You mean like exclusive friends?

21:38.090 --> 21:39.421
Why not?

21:40.326 --> 21:43.818
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

21:45.264 --> 21:47.027
Would it be so terrible?

21:47.933 --> 21:51.994
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

21:53.239 --> 21:58.836
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

21:59.078 --> 22:02.639
...and vowed to be friends forever.

22:08.621 --> 22:10.885
You know, we're back where we were.

22:12.625 --> 22:17.756
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

22:18.097 --> 22:21.794
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

22:23.369 --> 22:26.429
Okay, one thing's changed.

22:26.872 --> 22:30.433
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

22:31.577 --> 22:33.044
You know what?

22:33.546 --> 22:36.379
I gotta walk out of here right now...

22:37.716 --> 22:41.584
...because getting over you is the
hardest thing I have ever had to do.

22:43.556 --> 22:45.615
I don't think I could do it again.

22:46.559 --> 22:49.084
I know I couldn't.

22:50.262 --> 22:52.196
Yeah.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.234
So...

23:03.976 --> 23:06.945
How about one last
game of racquetball?

23:12.451 --> 23:14.510
Watch the thorns!

23:21.393 --> 23:23.088
What?

23:24.497 --> 23:26.021
Beth is really, really sick.

23:31.537 --> 23:35.667
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

23:39.078 --> 23:40.477
- Joey?
- Yeah.

23:40.646 --> 23:43.206
You wanna put the book
in the freezer?

23:47.052 --> 23:48.041
