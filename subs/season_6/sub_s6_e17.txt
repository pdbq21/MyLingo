WEBVTT

00:06.139 --> 00:08.801
Remember when I had a monkey?

00:09.509 --> 00:11.238
What was I thinking?

00:12.979 --> 00:17.575
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent
tip? Did I do something wrong?

00:19.085 --> 00:21.019
20 percent is a pretty generous tip.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.381
You know what's more generous?
50 percent!

00:25.225 --> 00:28.752
- You know what's even more generous?
- I see where you're going.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.929
What's up with the greed?

00:31.264 --> 00:32.561
I'm sorry.

00:32.832 --> 00:37.326
I have to get new headshots made,
and they're really expensive.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.198
I'm down to, like, three.

00:40.273 --> 00:43.504
Actually, two, because one of them
I blackened some teeth.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.438
Why'd I do that?

00:46.346 --> 00:49.338
Isn't there something you can do
to earn extra money?

00:49.582 --> 00:52.449
Can't you pick up an extra shift here?

00:52.752 --> 00:55.846
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.921
It helps if you've got
a little of this going on.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.392
Wow! I still have it.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.798
Don't you have an audition today?
Maybe you'll get that job.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.364
Wait a minute.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.473
I used to get medical experiments
done on me.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.600
Finally, an explanation.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.809
I used to get paid for
all kinds of medical stuff.

01:23.049 --> 01:27.281
Let's see... Well, I don't want
to donate sperm again.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.114
I really prefer doing that
at the home office.

01:30.657 --> 01:34.616
Maybe they want some of my blood
or spit or something, huh?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.187
- Joey?
- Yeah.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.832
What did I tell you
about talking while working?

01:40.066 --> 01:41.124
Do it?

01:42.302 --> 01:47.399
That guy's been waiting 10 minutes.
He's complained about you three times.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.137
Now, where was I?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.739
The One With Unagi

02:31.484 --> 02:32.746
What are you up to?

02:32.986 --> 02:36.080
We went to a self-defense class today.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.985
Kicking a guy in the crotch all
morning really takes it out of you.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.290
Takes it out of you?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.295
Now we can kick anybody's ass.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.763
After one class?
I don't think so.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.599
You want to see me self-defend myself?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.806
Pretend you're a predator.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.200
Go on, I dare you!

02:56.776 --> 03:00.644
Of course you can defend yourself from
an attack you know is coming.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.678
That's not enough.

03:02.882 --> 03:06.113
Look, I studied karate
for a long time.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.487
And there's a concept you
should be familiar with.

03:10.723 --> 03:14.955
It's what the Japanese call unagi.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.694
Isn't that a kind of sushi?

03:19.799 --> 03:20.891
No, it's a concept.

03:21.167 --> 03:24.000
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.070
Maybe it means that too.

03:26.306 --> 03:29.400
I would kill for
a salmon-skin roll right now.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.770
Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.

03:34.013 --> 03:37.813
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.

03:40.086 --> 03:44.819
Unagi is a state of total awareness.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.818
Only by achieving true unagi...

03:48.094 --> 03:52.326
can you be prepared for any danger
that may befall you.

03:53.199 --> 03:56.032
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...

03:56.269 --> 03:58.134
or your kettle of fish?

04:02.008 --> 04:06.502
It's one thing being prepared
for an attack against each other.

04:06.779 --> 04:11.512
Whole other story being prepared for
an attack. I don't know.. Surprise!

04:19.359 --> 04:20.849
You knew that was coming...

04:21.127 --> 04:25.063
but that doesn't mean
you have unagi.

04:27.967 --> 04:32.370
If we made reservations, we could have
unagi in a half-hour.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.133
- Is Monica here?
- No.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.801
I need help. I don't know
what to get for Valentine's Day.

04:41.047 --> 04:45.814
Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.

04:46.919 --> 04:50.082
She was working,
so we're celebrating tonight.

04:50.323 --> 04:54.419
Why don't you book a day for
both of you at those romantic spas?

04:54.661 --> 04:56.993
That's actually a good idea.

04:57.263 --> 05:00.061
And, of course, crotchless panties.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.563
As appealing as that sounds
to her boyfriend...

05:06.039 --> 05:07.836
and her brother...

05:11.210 --> 05:14.077
We promised to make
each other gifts this year.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.611
- I love that.
- You guys!

05:16.015 --> 05:18.176
You can't make crotchless panties?

05:19.952 --> 05:21.613
You take scissors and cut..

05:21.854 --> 05:22.878
Okay, okay, okay.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.181
Making things sounds so much fun.

05:26.526 --> 05:29.620
I thought so too, until I papier-mached
one of my eyes shut.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.527
I love papier-mache!
What did you make?

05:32.799 --> 05:34.630
I made a flar-lar-lar.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.767
- What is that?
- Nothing!

05:40.139 --> 05:41.401
So, what are you gonna do?

05:41.607 --> 05:44.371
Have you made anything
I can take credit for?

05:44.610 --> 05:48.102
I have, I have! I started making
little sock bunnies!

05:48.314 --> 05:50.248
Oh, for crying out loud!

05:52.318 --> 05:54.616
Wait a minute. That is my sock!

05:56.723 --> 05:58.953
Now it's your little bunny friend.

06:08.735 --> 06:09.963
Okay...

06:15.308 --> 06:17.242
This actually is a flar-lar-lar.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.875
Can I ask about the
Valentine's Day gifts?

06:24.083 --> 06:26.608
- Yeah.
- Do we have to make the entire thing?

06:27.253 --> 06:29.448
Yes. Did you forget to make yours?

06:30.923 --> 06:32.413
Of course not.

06:33.626 --> 06:37.585
I just have to go to the place
where I made it and pick it up.

06:38.598 --> 06:42.034
I can't wait. It'll be
the best Valentine's Day ever!

06:44.103 --> 06:47.368
I can't believe it!
Make the presents!

06:48.541 --> 06:51.977
- What?
- Just so excited to make the presents!

07:00.353 --> 07:02.514
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.620
With all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.

07:07.560 --> 07:12.020
We're at the end of a research cycle
and not looking for applicants now.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.893
That's too bad. I've been saving up.

07:18.971 --> 07:21.872
You sure there's no studies
I can participate in?

07:22.508 --> 07:25.238
- Here's a schedule.
- Thanks.

07:26.412 --> 07:27.709
This one starts now.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.073
Only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.885
But it's $2000!

07:34.687 --> 07:36.154
Sorry.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.415
And this?

07:39.892 --> 07:44.852
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
on Attractive Nurse Receptionist. "

07:46.332 --> 07:49.733
Results are back on that one.
They're not good.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.004
- That was good.
- Yeah.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.609
Danger! Danger!

08:02.882 --> 08:05.043
What the hell was that?

08:05.384 --> 08:08.717
A lesson in the importance of unagi.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.582
You're a freak!

08:14.727 --> 08:15.853
Perhaps.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.654
Now I'm curious.

08:18.831 --> 08:23.928
At what point during those girlish
screams would you have kicked my ass?

08:26.439 --> 08:29.135
All right, so we weren't prepared!

08:30.610 --> 08:34.376
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic
measures to make my point.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.445
I just want you to be safe.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.479
Danger!

08:44.123 --> 08:45.488
Ah-ha!

08:45.825 --> 08:47.383
Unagi!

08:54.166 --> 08:56.396
2000 bucks is a lot of money.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.269
I wish I had a twin.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.839
Where could I find someone...

09:02.108 --> 09:04.804
who looks exactly like me?

09:26.632 --> 09:28.190
Chandler.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.201
I sensed it was you.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.437
What?

09:36.375 --> 09:37.672
Unagi.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.269
I'm always aware.

09:40.479 --> 09:43.471
Are you aware that unagi is an eel?

09:45.384 --> 09:48.114
- What's up?
- I can't figure out what to make Monica.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.687
Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?

09:50.957 --> 09:54.859
I'm going crazy.
Do you have anything homemade?

09:55.861 --> 09:58.227
You know what?
She'd love this.

09:58.464 --> 10:01.956
It's a replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.

10:03.502 --> 10:07.461
I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon. "

10:07.673 --> 10:10.574
Except Apollo 8 didn't
actually land on the moon.

10:10.810 --> 10:15.873
You can say, "Your love lets me orbit
the moon twice and return safely. "

10:18.084 --> 10:19.642
I can't give this to her.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.844
- Why not?
- It says "Captain Ross" on the side.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.716
And it says "I hate Monica"
on the bottom.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.162
Danger!

10:41.507 --> 10:43.668
Salmon-skin roll.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.360
Yes, honey, I made it myself.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.571
I can't do it. I can't do it.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.448
A mixed tape! A mixed tape!

11:31.123 --> 11:33.717
Hi! Ready to exchange gifts?

11:33.959 --> 11:36.951
- Sure. You go first.
- Okay, come here.

11:37.163 --> 11:40.997
Okay, it's not wrapped
because I just finished it.

11:41.801 --> 11:45.567
But I made you a tape of what I think
are all romantic songs.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.930
What a great gift!

11:51.577 --> 11:54.011
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.673
We'll have to listen and see.

11:59.585 --> 12:02.349
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.981
You ready to open yours?

12:18.604 --> 12:19.866
It's a sock bunny.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.774
Remember how I call you bunny?

12:23.709 --> 12:25.108
Not really.

12:26.612 --> 12:29.775
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.115
- That's what this is about.
- I see.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.684
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

12:35.888 --> 12:39.517
No, she doesn't.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.319
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.356
I didn't make it!

12:44.563 --> 12:48.363
I forgot about tonight and that we're
supposed to make the presents.

12:48.734 --> 12:49.860
It's okay.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.394
No, it's not okay.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.296
You're so incredible.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.406
You went through all this time
and effort to make this tape.

12:59.578 --> 13:01.478
I'll make this up to you.
I will.

13:01.714 --> 13:06.242
I am going to cook you
anything you want in here.

13:06.485 --> 13:10.751
And I'm going to do anything
you want in there.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.988
Well, I did put a lot of thought
into the tape.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.003
You are way too young
to have seen that.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.639
Your birthday's in a month and a half.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.416
What if I forget to get you
a present for that too?

13:38.684 --> 13:42.450
You are totally and completely
100 percent forgiven.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.188
We've got to wash that.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.328
Remember that jacket you loved
that was too expensive?

13:53.599 --> 13:55.590
You have done enough.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.299
I'll wake up early and get it.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.665
No, you don't..
Get it in black, not brown.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.033
Your cake is ready.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.950
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake. "

14:15.888 --> 14:18.686
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.454
Who the hell are you?

14:26.465 --> 14:27.727
I'm Joey.

14:28.734 --> 14:30.793
How are you doing?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.035
No! No! No! No! No!

14:35.507 --> 14:37.031
How you doing?

14:38.711 --> 14:42.340
How you doing?
Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.220
I've got to apologize
on behalf of Carl.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.515
Who the hell is Carl?

14:53.259 --> 14:54.521
Did I not mention?

14:55.761 --> 15:00.892
Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin
for a medical research project.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.839
Sometimes the good ideas are
right in front of you.

15:08.774 --> 15:13.177
It sounds crazy, but it might work.
The only problem is Carl's acting...

15:13.412 --> 15:15.243
The only problem?

15:16.415 --> 15:20.249
He's the reason I didn't get that big
commercial a couple of years ago.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.716
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed up.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.081
Can I get a piece of that cake?

15:26.558 --> 15:29.254
Pizza! We like pizza!
Get out!

15:37.202 --> 15:39.432
- Pat Sajak?
- Yep.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.639
- Alex Trebek?
- Of course.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.240
- Chuck Woolery?
- Definitely.

15:44.443 --> 15:49.471
You will not find a single game-show
host whose ass I cannot kick.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.289
- Say it!
- Say we are unagi!

16:02.828 --> 16:05.956
It's not something you are,
it's something you have.

16:06.966 --> 16:07.990
Say it!

16:08.233 --> 16:09.928
I could easily get out of this...

16:10.169 --> 16:14.071
but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt!

16:26.618 --> 16:30.987
Carl, we're next. Now remember,
what is this not gonna be?

16:31.256 --> 16:34.123
- Another Minute Maid fiasco.
- That's right.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.658
And what are you not gonna do?

16:35.828 --> 16:39.491
- I'm not gonna talk because..
- Damn it, Carl!

16:43.936 --> 16:45.767
Can I have the next one, please?

16:46.038 --> 16:47.266
Thank you.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.503
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.204
That's us.

16:51.477 --> 16:54.776
But this is a study
for identical twins.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.881
That's right. $2000.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.848
But you're not identical twins.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.351
Damn it, Carl!

17:11.897 --> 17:13.888
Oh, my good God.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.903
Continuing the countdown of your
favorite meals.

17:20.239 --> 17:23.072
Tonight, number three:

17:23.575 --> 17:26.840
Macaroni and cheese
with cut-up hot dogs.

17:28.847 --> 17:32.146
Look, you have done enough.
You have to stop this now.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.375
I will, but not tonight.

17:34.586 --> 17:38.716
For dinner music, I thought we could
listen to that tape that you made me.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.716
Oh, the mixed tape.

17:49.168 --> 17:52.103
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.

17:52.371 --> 17:53.599
Dance with me.

18:12.524 --> 18:15.357
You are just the sweetest.

18:17.563 --> 18:22.694
I love the way you look every night,
Chandler.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.597
That's why I made you this tape.

18:29.875 --> 18:34.107
Happy birthday!
Love, Janice!

18:39.818 --> 18:41.479
No, you're the sweetest.

18:47.926 --> 18:50.588
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.388
Remember, be safe out there.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.135
- Great class.
- Thanks.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.271
I was watching.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.437
A couple of questions:

19:09.648 --> 19:11.343
You know that last move...

19:11.617 --> 19:14.745
where that woman tripped you
and pinned you to the floor?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.284
What would you do next?

19:16.522 --> 19:18.922
She'd take the keys
and jam them in your..

19:19.158 --> 19:22.127
No, no. What would you do next?

19:22.427 --> 19:25.294
- Who, me, the attacker?
- Yes, that's right.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.487
Why?

19:27.699 --> 19:31.191
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.527
What?

19:32.771 --> 19:35.001
No, it's okay.
They're my friends.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.606
In fact, I was married to one of them.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.113
You attacked your ex-wife?

19:42.314 --> 19:44.179
Oh, no. No, no.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.077
I tried.

19:47.619 --> 19:51.282
But I couldn't.
That's why I'm here.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.115
Maybe we could attack them together!

19:56.495 --> 19:58.087
That's a no.

19:59.665 --> 20:03.328
I am so, so, so, so sorry.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.106
And I will cook
anything you want in here...

20:11.343 --> 20:14.870
and do anything you want in there.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.441
Yeah, you will!
And are you kidding me?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.852
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.182
Please, please, please, please?

20:29.561 --> 20:30.550
Okay.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.876
- So are we going in there?
- I am!

21:04.529 --> 21:06.997
Nowhere to run.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.964
I don't like sitting up here.
I'm gonna go over..

21:12.170 --> 21:13.694
No, they got here first.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.378
- Why is Ross doing that?
- Danger!

21:25.617 --> 21:30.145
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?

21:31.690 --> 21:33.715
We should help them.

21:33.992 --> 21:37.052
I don't think they need any help.
