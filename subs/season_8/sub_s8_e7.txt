00:04.237 --> 00:09.265
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

00:09.442 --> 00:13.276
You did the windows! I have been begging
you for months! And you did, you cleaned.

00:13.546 --> 00:18.574
-And nagging works!
-No, I didn't actually do this.

00:18.785 --> 00:22.551
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

00:22.956 --> 00:24.253
No, it wasn't you.

00:24.457 --> 00:28.188
-Well, then, who?
-I got a maid. Yay!

00:28.762 --> 00:34.291
I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"
because if some other woman was cleaning..

00:34.534 --> 00:38.061
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

00:38.304 --> 00:41.740
"Relinquish" is just a fancy word
for "lose."

00:41.975 --> 00:48.403
She's nice, and she mentioned that she
adored the way you arranged the sponges.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.743
Did she really say that?

00:50.984 --> 00:54.681
Yes, I distinctly remember because
I thought it was a joke.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.052
-Now, just give her a chance, okay?
-Fine, I can do it.

01:00.894 --> 01:05.922
-What's the matter?
-Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.072
Whose cell phone is that?
It's just so annoying. Everywhere you go.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.144
I think it's coming from your bag.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.949
I never get calls!

01:59.185 --> 02:00.812
Hello?

02:01.054 --> 02:07.186
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiance.

02:07.427 --> 02:10.988
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?

02:11.197 --> 02:14.428
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it for me.

02:14.634 --> 02:19.697
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

02:19.939 --> 02:22.999
Listen, I just.. I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.973
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

02:26.179 --> 02:29.615
-What did he do?
-I'm talking!

02:30.583 --> 02:36.818
Anyway, I was wondering if you were
the sort of person who eats lunch?

02:37.924 --> 02:39.619
Are you asking me out?

02:39.859 --> 02:44.319
Because it'd be kind of weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

02:44.531 --> 02:49.230
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.

02:49.469 --> 02:53.371
No, no. Wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.498
Fight for me.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.479
I won't take "no" for an answer.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.205
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch.

03:03.416 --> 03:06.715
I can be at your apartment
in two hours.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.354
Great. How do you know where I live?

03:09.556 --> 03:12.150
I've got friends too.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.620
Okay, bye.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.889
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

03:17.130 --> 03:21.760
This day is really gonna be so much better
than I thought it was gonna be.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.868
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.404
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.237
I can't. I'm busy.
I'm apartment hunting.

03:33.446 --> 03:34.936
You're moving?

03:35.181 --> 03:38.207
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

03:38.451 --> 03:43.184
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doing?"

03:44.057 --> 03:46.048
So does Joey know you're moving?

03:46.259 --> 03:49.194
I haven't discussed it with him,
but I know he'll be relieved.

03:49.429 --> 03:54.298
Last week, he brought this girl over,
and I talked to her about morning sickness.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.899
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

03:57.103 --> 04:00.732
-That's not really porn?
-Not so much.

04:00.974 --> 04:07.072
I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

04:07.280 --> 04:13.241
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

04:13.753 --> 04:18.053
I don't know, but how great would that be?
You living in my building?

04:18.291 --> 04:22.284
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want..

04:22.495 --> 04:24.053
with your permission.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.257
That really would be great.
Well, can we see it?

04:28.501 --> 04:32.062
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, if she just died this morning.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.605
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.810
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.912
Yes?

04:51.124 --> 04:54.116
Hi. I'm Ross Geller.
I live in the building.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.922
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

04:59.499 --> 05:05.369
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.835
-She didn't pass away.
-What?

05:08.041 --> 05:12.671
-My mother's still alive.
-Oh, thank God!

05:13.646 --> 05:19.346
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's a tough old bird.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.247
Are you close with her?

05:21.487 --> 05:26.015
Of course. She and I would
talk all the time..

05:26.259 --> 05:29.456
in the laundry room.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.290
You speak Dutch?

05:38.638 --> 05:42.506
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.471
So she's really not dead.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.012
No. She's hanging in there.

05:50.216 --> 05:56.155
Could you tell me, is she hanging in
in a one-bedroom or a two?

05:59.692 --> 06:03.788
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

06:03.996 --> 06:07.159
Oh, well..
I make it myself.

06:07.367 --> 06:12.566
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient is..

06:12.805 --> 06:15.865
You know what? We just met.

06:16.075 --> 06:20.068
Okay. I'm gonna go get the clothes
from the laundry room now.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.871
When I come back,
I'll clean behind the refrigerator.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.744
I love her.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.020
I'll be back in a minute.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.824
Okay.

06:32.024 --> 06:36.518
-See? I told you.
-She stole my jeans!

06:38.197 --> 06:39.858
What?

06:40.366 --> 06:43.199
I've been looking for them all week,
and she is wearing them.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.965
So she stole your pants and then
came back and wore them in front of you?

06:48.207 --> 06:52.143
Don't you see?
It's the perfect crime!

06:52.412 --> 06:55.438
She must have been
planning this for years!

06:55.648 --> 06:56.945
I'll prove it to you, okay.

06:57.216 --> 07:02.279
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left
an ink stain on the crotch.

07:02.488 --> 07:07.152
When she comes back, I will find it
and show you that stain!

07:09.262 --> 07:15.098
Isn't it possible the company that sold
the jeans made more than just the one pair?

07:15.301 --> 07:16.495
I guess.

07:16.736 --> 07:22.800
Shouldn't we give her the benefit of the
doubt before we snoop around her crotch?

07:23.743 --> 07:27.645
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.248
Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?

07:30.416 --> 07:31.678
Yeah.

07:37.423 --> 07:41.154
-Hi.
-Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.418
Yeah. Me too.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.995
Not in the shaky, angry way
that you are, though.

07:46.265 --> 07:50.463
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
I had to get the engagement ring back.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.969
Just seeing her brought it all back.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.540
All the lies, the way she used me.

07:57.810 --> 08:02.042
I just.. I get so angry,
just looking at her..

08:04.784 --> 08:09.949
-Face.
-Yeah. Yeah.

08:10.490 --> 08:15.359
I'm sorry. It's just,
when I look at you..

08:15.628 --> 08:17.653
I see her.

08:18.164 --> 08:23.500
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.403
So where do you wanna eat?

08:28.574 --> 08:31.475
Not that I'm not enjoying
watching you flip out.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.346
Sorry.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.573
-Maybe this is too weird.
-Wait.

08:36.749 --> 08:41.379
There's only a problem
when I look at you.

08:42.088 --> 08:44.522
I got it. I got it.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.821
No, don't tear out your eyes!

08:48.027 --> 08:52.691
-I was just gonna take out my lenses.
-Oh, yeah. Try that.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.467
So is that better?

08:57.670 --> 08:59.729
Not really.

09:01.040 --> 09:07.468
You're blurry, but you still
look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."

09:08.781 --> 09:13.275
Okay, wait. Maybe..

09:14.086 --> 09:17.886
If I just don't look at you
for a while.

09:19.525 --> 09:25.589
See? It works. I'm not angry at
all anymore. This is a great date!

09:26.432 --> 09:28.263
Yeah, not so much.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.634
It's kind of hard
to have a conversation.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.738
Oh, no.
Sure, we can have a conversation.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.272
Tell me a little
something about yourself.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.572
Oh, me?

09:41.480 --> 09:44.540
Look, Eric, turn around.

09:46.052 --> 09:50.489
I like you, but it shouldn't be
this hard. This is our first date.

09:50.756 --> 09:54.123
First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity and..

09:54.327 --> 09:59.890
"He just touched my hand,
did he mean to?" and first kisses..

10:01.934 --> 10:04.334
Second kisses.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.606
Thanks for the coffee, or:

10:20.987 --> 10:23.512
Yeah, we're done.

10:30.229 --> 10:35.428
Hey, Ross. You wanna go see
that new lMAX movie on tide pools?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.728
-Really?
-No.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.506
But I got Knicks tickets
for you, me and Chandler.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.107
Sweet!

10:44.276 --> 10:46.540
And then afterwards,
we can go to a strip joint.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.577
-Really?
-No.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.806
All right, let's go.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.913
I have to stop by my place.

10:54.120 --> 10:59.524
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

10:59.725 --> 11:02.626
No, I have to see if this apartment
became available.

11:02.862 --> 11:06.263
-You're switching apartments?
-It's not for me, it's for Rachel.

11:06.465 --> 11:09.559
-She has an apartment.
-When the baby comes, she's gonna move.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.760
-She is?
-Yeah.

11:11.971 --> 11:15.463
You didn't expect her
to live there with the baby?

11:15.708 --> 11:18.336
I didn't really think about it.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.912
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.452
Damn it!

11:36.295 --> 11:38.855
-Nice jeans.
-Oh, thanks.

11:39.065 --> 11:43.502
-I like your top.
-Oh. You're not getting it.

11:50.576 --> 11:54.979
-What happened?
-Oh. I fell asleep!

11:55.781 --> 11:58.682
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

11:58.918 --> 12:03.787
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll work up your appetite for lunch.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.820
All right.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.842
Hello.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.012
What's going on?

12:33.419 --> 12:38.152
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

12:40.192 --> 12:41.659
I don't understand.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.352
Why was your head
just between my legs?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.327
That's a fair question.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.662
Well, my head was
between your legs..

12:49.835 --> 12:52.929
because I find you
very attractive.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.471
Are you coming onto me?

12:55.641 --> 12:56.869
Apparently.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.268
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:01.447 --> 13:07.317
-How was the game?
-It was okay. I ate way too much.

13:10.656 --> 13:14.148
I was talking to Ross, and he said
you were looking for a new place.

13:14.360 --> 13:19.957
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.467
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

13:24.837 --> 13:28.432
Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

13:28.674 --> 13:33.236
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

13:33.445 --> 13:37.472
You could put it over here.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.810
Or we could put it right here.
It's cute, right?

13:41.053 --> 13:44.489
Or put it over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

13:44.690 --> 13:48.023
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over.."

13:48.861 --> 13:52.524
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

13:52.798 --> 13:56.165
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.

13:56.368 --> 14:01.169
Imagine bringing home some girl and
trying to score with a screaming baby.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.900
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.875
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't.

14:09.081 --> 14:12.209
It would disrupt your entire life.

14:12.585 --> 14:17.852
It's just..
I love living with you so much.

14:18.057 --> 14:22.187
-I wish things didn't have to change.
-I know.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.363
You know, I blame Ross for this.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.895
I do too, a little bit.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.501
I'm gonna miss you.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.332
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

14:41.213 --> 14:45.047
Oh, no, I have to go.
I have a massage appointment.

14:45.251 --> 14:49.187
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.687
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.416
-I'll see you later?
-Absolutely.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.888
I love the way you kiss.

15:00.099 --> 15:04.763
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
You'll see.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.636
Hey.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.608
-Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.
-How come?

15:15.848 --> 15:18.612
Because I put my head
between her legs.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.752
-To see her pants?
-They're my pants!

15:21.954 --> 15:23.854
Are you sure?
Did you see the stain?

15:24.056 --> 15:28.254
No. I was getting into position,
and then everything went dark.

15:28.494 --> 15:32.362
She is not stealing from us, okay.
Will you let this go?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.395
Fine.

15:39.405 --> 15:43.239
-She's wearing my bra!
-Oh, dear God!

15:43.442 --> 15:46.172
My pink, flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

15:46.412 --> 15:49.643
Yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

15:49.915 --> 15:53.476
Here's the plan. I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.484
Here's another plan. No.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.954
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

16:00.159 --> 16:03.788
-Why?
-Did you not hear where my head was?

16:04.530 --> 16:07.431
We're a team.
We're in this together.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.501
I fear a jury will see it
the same way.

16:12.204 --> 16:16.038
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.436
You see that?

16:18.677 --> 16:20.167
Do you see this?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.116
All right, yes.
Okay. I get your point.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.150
But if it's not her bra, will you
just let the woman clean?

16:28.354 --> 16:34.782
Yes. You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, there's a very noticeable rip.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.824
You need new clothes.

16:43.235 --> 16:46.636
-Hi. How is she?
-It's not looking good.

16:50.676 --> 16:55.238
Well, I brought her some bloemen.

16:55.481 --> 17:01.147
That's so sweet. Would you like to say
goodbye? It would mean a lot to her.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.686
Oh, I don't know that it would.

17:04.890 --> 17:09.486
-Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
-All right, then.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.529
-Hey!
-Welcome back.

17:22.074 --> 17:26.670
-Shall we pick up from where we left off?
-I'm still tired from this afternoon.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.109
-Why?
-The sex.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.213
-What sex?
-Our sex.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.748
We didn't have sex.

17:32.985 --> 17:37.615
If I didn't have sex with you, I had sex
with somebody that looked like..

17:44.496 --> 17:48.262
-You had sex with Ursula?
-A little bit.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.526
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and..

17:51.737 --> 17:57.039
-You didn't notice different clothes?
-I was just so excited to see you.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.647
-This is too weird.
-No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.

18:04.883 --> 18:08.819
It's like I was saying to Ursula
when I was making love..

18:09.088 --> 18:11.215
Yeah. It's too weird.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.318
So I guess this is it.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.586
Yeah.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.030
Maybe it's for the best.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.066
-You smell just like her.
-Yeah, so do you.

18:43.922 --> 18:48.086
-What are you doing?
-I'm leaning.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.818
This is where I lean.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.456
Okay.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.329
-Brenda, a bee!
-What?

18:58.604 --> 19:04.167
It's flown into your blouse, and you better
undo your buttons lest it sting you.

19:05.377 --> 19:09.711
-I think I know what's going on here.
-You do?

19:09.948 --> 19:13.975
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian..

19:15.854 --> 19:18.584
but it's wrong. You're married.

19:18.790 --> 19:22.021
-I totally understand.
-Okay, good.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.957
Could I just see your bra?

19:28.433 --> 19:30.162
Hi.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.803
-Where'd you get those jeans?
-You gave them to me.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.807
-No, I didn't!
-All right, I took them.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.708
I figured it'd be okay because
you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.715
-Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
-What bra?

19:46.919 --> 19:51.720
-The pink one with the flowers.
-You mean the one you're wearing?

19:55.227 --> 19:57.024
I quit!

19:58.163 --> 20:00.188
Sounds about right.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.433
What is this?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.198
This is just to give you an idea.

20:11.443 --> 20:14.844
We can put screens here
so that the baby has privacy..

20:15.013 --> 20:18.141
and maybe a mobile over the crib..

20:18.350 --> 20:24.255
and here's a baby monitor which, till the
baby comes, we can use as walkie-talkies.

20:25.090 --> 20:28.526
You're so sweet!

20:28.760 --> 20:33.424
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

20:38.537 --> 20:42.234
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

20:42.474 --> 20:46.035
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.316
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.112
-I'm loud.
-It's gonna be up all night.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.585
-I'm up all night.
-It's gonna poop.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.190
Hello!

21:02.427 --> 21:04.292
What about all the women?

21:04.496 --> 21:08.262
If I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand a baby..

21:08.467 --> 21:11.630
then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.568
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

21:15.941 --> 21:19.035
But I won't say stuff
like that around the baby.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.369
Joey, are you sure?

21:21.613 --> 21:25.447
Yeah. Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay..

21:25.684 --> 21:31.054
but it'll also be really,
really great.

21:31.323 --> 21:35.555
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

21:36.795 --> 21:41.391
I want me to stay too. Thank you.

21:43.135 --> 21:48.163
-Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute.
-I know. I found it on the street.

21:48.373 --> 21:52.469
Are you..? Really?
This is in such good condition.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.976
Whoa! What's under the cover?

21:55.180 --> 21:57.546
-I don't know.
-It's moving.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.013
It's got a tail! Get it out of here!

22:00.218 --> 22:01.845
Okay!

22:09.027 --> 22:13.225
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

22:13.432 --> 22:17.528
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

22:18.870 --> 22:23.534
And because I'm such a strong,
strapping alleenstaande..

22:24.476 --> 22:26.740
I had to carry her body to the lobby.

22:26.912 --> 22:29.779
You know, and she was
not a slight woman.

22:31.350 --> 22:35.377
But I don't care, because
you got the apartment. Yes!

22:35.587 --> 22:41.617
Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.885
Isn't that great?

22:44.062 --> 22:46.690
What..? You..
But.. Bu..
