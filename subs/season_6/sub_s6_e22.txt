WEBVTT

00:03.269 --> 00:04.463
Hi, you guys.

00:04.704 --> 00:06.194
What's the matter?

00:06.406 --> 00:09.398
Well, it's just.. It's one of these
situations that I just hate.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.077
A massage client gave me three tickets...

00:12.278 --> 00:14.940
to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.808
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

00:18.518 --> 00:22.579
No. No. It's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.983
- I'll give up my ticket.
- Me too.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.324
Okay. That's so generous.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.757
And I think Ross is generous too.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.932
Great! Then it's just us girls.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.566
- Great.
- Yeah.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.360
So what is the exhibit?

00:37.570 --> 00:40.198
It's mostly just photographs...

00:40.373 --> 00:45.367
of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.311
Oh, man!

00:54.487 --> 00:56.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.548
Hey, Ross, listen.

00:57.757 --> 01:01.887
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

01:03.396 --> 01:08.459
Thanks, but I have plans.
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

01:08.668 --> 01:09.999
- That's great!
- Yeah.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.434
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.

01:12.639 --> 01:13.628
Why? What?

01:13.840 --> 01:16.741
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

01:18.244 --> 01:21.077
That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.249
You know, let it go. Stop it!

01:23.817 --> 01:26.377
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father...

01:26.586 --> 01:29.487
so he's much older than she is.

01:29.889 --> 01:33.985
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils.

01:35.562 --> 01:39.396
All that does is remind us
that you're interested in fossils.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.362
Okay, okay.

01:42.569 --> 01:47.563
Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.279
- Ross?
- Come on! That's funny.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.177
Because he's gonna..
He's got, like, a hearing aid.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.878
Because he's all old.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.353
One second.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.858
Okay, look, Ross.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.658
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

02:16.836 --> 02:19.236
I've accepted the fact
that you're dating her.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.066
Really? That's great.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.499
Yeah, but then I changed my mind.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.409
I'm funny like that.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.945
So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.617
I don't want you
seeing my daughter anymore.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.116
Look, I realize it upsets you.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.049
Yes, it does.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.684
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

02:40.894 --> 02:44.728
so I don't think there's
anything you can do about it.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.765
I'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.196
Oh, a man with a plan!

02:53.206 --> 02:55.367
The One Where Paul's The Man

03:30.877 --> 03:34.779
This is so exciting. You can get your
picture back up on the wall of fame.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.812
He's got all the big actors.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.315
It was so cool when I was up there.

03:39.485 --> 03:42.943
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

03:43.323 --> 03:46.622
I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.294
Now he's just laughing at me.

03:49.495 --> 03:53.363
Look at him.
That smug Belushi bastard!

03:54.834 --> 03:57.860
Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...

03:58.037 --> 03:59.902
they could put you by Matt Lauer.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.540
Look at him just smiling at me.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.410
Yeah, I know.
We'd be great together.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.118
- So I'm back.
- Who are you?

04:16.222 --> 04:17.553
Joey Tribbiani.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.422
From the wall?

04:20.093 --> 04:23.062
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.122
Okay, anyway.

04:28.334 --> 04:32.065
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

04:33.306 --> 04:36.537
- Show me in the TV book.
- It's not on TV yet.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.541
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

04:40.513 --> 04:44.040
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.153
So, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes?

04:48.354 --> 04:51.653
Maybe? Just ones that
haven't been cleaned yet?

04:53.393 --> 04:55.122
God.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.262
I love museums.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.764
- Soaking up all the culture.
- Yeah.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.699
- Where do you want to start?
- The gift shop!

05:06.673 --> 05:09.733
- And then lunch.
- Yes, but I can't eat too much.

05:09.942 --> 05:14.242
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.710
Do you think maybe
he's gonna tell you he's gay?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.316
What? No, why?

05:20.520 --> 05:24.183
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

05:25.058 --> 05:28.459
You could put the aisle over here
and have the wedding ceremony over here.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.629
I didn't know you could get married here.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.128
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.894
But I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I would never have the ceremony there.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.197
You'd have the ceremony
under a beautiful arch.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.299
May I help you?

05:41.741 --> 05:44.767
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's just such a beautiful space.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.412
- Do you do a lot of weddings?
- Yes, we're popular.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.343
There's a two-year waiting list.
Sorry.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.844
Monica, you should put
your name down for this place.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.782
What? Are you crazy?

05:56.155 --> 05:58.919
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.489
But there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

06:02.895 --> 06:04.886
Then you've got to wait
another two years?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.862
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.035
He's gonna find somebody else.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.636
Someone who did put their name
on the list.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.036
It can't hurt to put your name down.

06:16.242 --> 06:19.939
If, in two years, you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

06:20.146 --> 06:23.013
I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.815
I'm gonna do it too.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.006
Me too!

06:26.652 --> 06:30.554
- Really? Who would you marry?
- I don't have anyone right now.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.815
Oh, Phoebe.

06:32.458 --> 06:36.485
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.162
Phoebe, that's not..

06:39.365 --> 06:42.266
Don't even get me started on yours.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.605
- Did you watch the tape of my show?
- I did.

06:47.807 --> 06:51.538
- Let's get me back up there.
- You don't go up on the wall.

06:52.812 --> 06:57.909
- What? But you saw the show.
- It was very offensive to my people.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.513
Dry cleaners?

07:03.189 --> 07:06.556
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.160
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!

07:10.363 --> 07:12.661
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.129
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring nothing!

07:15.535 --> 07:16.900
Okay, that may be true.

07:17.103 --> 07:21.301
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!

07:21.507 --> 07:24.943
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

07:25.144 --> 07:28.705
- I've never seen it.
- You should. It's great!

07:33.986 --> 07:36.546
This place is really beautiful.

07:36.756 --> 07:40.658
I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.091
The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.192
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.233
But people say that my eyes look...

07:50.536 --> 07:52.060
Do you wanna make out?

07:52.271 --> 07:53.795
Sure.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.005
Are you okay?

07:59.512 --> 08:00.672
What's wrong?

08:00.880 --> 08:04.213
Yeah. I was just thinking
about your father.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.044
Well, whatever works for you.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.742
No.

08:10.756 --> 08:14.487
He just really freaked me out before.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.993
So we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.255
Big deal.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.558
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.092
Yeah.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.798
- Yeah?
- You brought protection, right?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.671
Why, are there, like, bears or something?

08:37.517 --> 08:41.044
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That.. That I forgot.

08:42.889 --> 08:47.258
I can't believe I brought two cans
of bug spray and forgot that.

08:48.294 --> 08:52.060
- I'll run to the store and get some.
- I'm the guy. I'll get it.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.859
- Do you know where the store is?
- No.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.434
Do you wanna ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

08:59.071 --> 09:01.062
A little bit.

09:01.941 --> 09:06.674
I'll be back in 10 minutes. Get in
the hot tub and I'll meet you there.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.202
Okay.

09:22.495 --> 09:26.522
Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!

09:26.732 --> 09:30.327
Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.472
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey, Joe.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.649
Everybody's gotta be doing something.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.850
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.856
If you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.288
Yeah, we are.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.387
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.592
I'm calling for Monica Geller. I wanted to
let her know that there was a cancellation.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.830
If she's still interested in having the
Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...

10:08.040 --> 10:09.667
...it is available..

10:10.009 --> 10:12.671
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

10:13.346 --> 10:14.540
Yes, the groom.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.112
No, not the groom!

10:20.553 --> 10:22.282
It's so secluded up here.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.489
I know. That's why I like it here.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.784
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

10:31.731 --> 10:32.720
Sorry.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.866
What's the matter, honey?

10:40.373 --> 10:43.467
- Did you see a little mouse?
- No! Big bear! Big bear outside!

10:43.643 --> 10:44.632
I think I..

10:44.844 --> 10:49.474
- Actually, would you go check on that?
- We don't have any bears here.

10:49.682 --> 10:50.944
Well, okay.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.084
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.550
- Okay. Be right back.
- Okay.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.352
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

11:04.563 --> 11:07.623
- I came with Paul!
- Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.401
- Where is Elizabeth?
- She's at the store.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.572
- You make the girl go to the store?
- Do I know where the store is?

11:16.075 --> 11:17.599
Hurry up. Get out.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.134
Here you go, honey.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.881
- Thank you!
- Diet Coke.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.141
Ice.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.310
I need ice.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.280
Okay.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.190
- Thank you.
- Be right back.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.381
Okay.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.160
You and your ice.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.559
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!

11:44.570 --> 11:46.697
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

11:47.940 --> 11:50.067
- Did you really hear a bear?
- Go!

11:53.646 --> 11:55.136
Here you go, honey.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.740
One Diet Coke with ice.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.683
Thank you.

12:01.921 --> 12:05.254
I am so happy that you're here.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.186
- Here I am!
- Elizabeth!

12:08.694 --> 12:10.457
Look! Elizabeth's here!

12:13.099 --> 12:15.192
Who were you talking to?

12:15.367 --> 12:16.629
You guys?

12:18.637 --> 12:20.730
How did you know we were here?

12:20.940 --> 12:26.071
She obviously saw the tire tracks
leading up to the closed garage.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.674
Obviously.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.746
What are you doing here?

12:40.192 --> 12:43.719
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

12:44.029 --> 12:45.053
Yeah.

12:45.564 --> 12:48.624
Well, why don't you go in that room
and do your homework?

12:48.968 --> 12:52.335
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.872
That's your dad's bedroom.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.609
That's your dad's bedroom!

13:03.749 --> 13:04.943
Why are you yelling?

13:05.384 --> 13:08.114
That Diet Coke, I think,
just straight to my head!

13:13.692 --> 13:15.319
Hi, honey.

13:15.494 --> 13:16.688
See you later.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.525
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.131
Well, next time, ask!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.597
Or at least wait for me to ask!

13:38.150 --> 13:41.085
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.188
- I'm calling for Monica Geller.
- Oh, no.

13:44.456 --> 13:47.152
I wanted to let her know
that there was a cancellation.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.921
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...

13:51.130 --> 13:52.324
it is available...

13:52.531 --> 13:54.226
Please. He didn't hear it!

13:54.433 --> 13:57.027
This is Chandler Bing!
This is Chandler Bing!

13:58.804 --> 13:59.862
No!

14:03.509 --> 14:04.840
Can I help you?

14:05.411 --> 14:08.812
Yeah, where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

14:09.014 --> 14:12.006
- He's not here right now.
- You're kidding me!

14:12.218 --> 14:16.416
Make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani
stopped by to drop off all these clothes.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.420
I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture on the wall.

14:19.892 --> 14:23.419
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.456
Oh, really?

14:26.832 --> 14:30.529
Well, maybe you and I go out
for drinks.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.800
You're the other one, right?

14:36.275 --> 14:38.539
So, Lizzie, are you planning on
staying the night?

14:38.911 --> 14:42.312
No, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

14:43.282 --> 14:47.412
Good. Not that we don't want you
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.747
How much more homework
do you have?

14:50.923 --> 14:54.552
I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.093
Rachel, maybe you wanna come
upstairs and help me figure it out?

14:58.597 --> 14:59.621
Really?

15:00.366 --> 15:01.424
Okay.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.831
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

15:04.470 --> 15:07.769
if you get me something
from the car.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.941
What do you need from the car?

15:10.209 --> 15:11.699
Surprise me.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.168
Okay.

15:16.148 --> 15:19.379
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!

15:19.585 --> 15:21.678
That's where everybody's gonna be!

15:45.678 --> 15:48.579
Just relax. Relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.949
She likes you.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.650
I think she likes you. She likes you.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.649
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.719
You are the man.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.487
You are the man!

16:08.834 --> 16:10.096
Still got it.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.501
Still sexy.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.769
You're just a love machine.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.456
Showtime.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.023
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

16:43.235 --> 16:44.964
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.968
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...

16:48.173 --> 16:51.267
and that we could move up our
wedding. And Chandler heard.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.477
I know. How bad is this?

16:53.746 --> 16:57.477
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!

16:59.284 --> 17:02.515
I know! And he totally freaked out.
I can't find him anywhere!

17:02.721 --> 17:05.884
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm never going to listen to you again.

17:06.091 --> 17:08.924
"What harm can it do
if you put your name down?"

17:10.229 --> 17:12.993
- Rachel said that.
- Well, Rachel's not here!

17:19.338 --> 17:21.636
You really think she put
your picture up already?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.672
Did she put my picture up?

17:23.842 --> 17:25.469
You kidding, after the date we had?

17:25.644 --> 17:28.545
I wouldn't be surprised if she put
10 of my pictures up there.

17:28.714 --> 17:33.310
Except for the fact that I only gave her one.
I don't know where she'd get the other nine.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.554
Here it is!

17:38.390 --> 17:40.790
Joey, why did you sign it
"son of a bitch"?

17:43.929 --> 17:47.365
- I didn't do that. Who would do that?
- Son of a bitch!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.791
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

17:50.335 --> 17:53.463
- You! Get out of my shop!
- What did he do?

17:53.672 --> 17:55.799
- He went out with my wife!
- Joey!

17:57.776 --> 18:00.336
I did not go out with your wife! Okay?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.202
I went out with her.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.314
That's my wife!

18:05.150 --> 18:08.381
I'm not pointing at her, no.
I'm pointing at her.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.488
"Zelda McMurray. "

18:11.957 --> 18:13.982
Who the hell..?
How did she get up there?!

18:14.159 --> 18:15.217
Get out!

18:18.397 --> 18:20.297
- Well, we should go.
- Yeah.

18:22.668 --> 18:23.692
Ross?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.202
Elizabeth!

18:33.245 --> 18:36.681
Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.507
I'll meet you at the front door.
Tell them you're going home.

18:40.719 --> 18:43.119
- Okay.
- Wait! No, don't go in there!

18:43.589 --> 18:46.114
Don't go in there!
I need another soda!

18:47.359 --> 18:48.383
Ross!

18:50.395 --> 18:53.853
Oh, my God, Ross!
What in heaven's name are you doing here?

18:56.768 --> 19:00.226
And that is why
we cannot see each other anymore.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.904
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

19:07.112 --> 19:08.306
- Daddy, I..
- You're next!

19:08.514 --> 19:10.482
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.650
Let me just see if I got this straight.

19:15.854 --> 19:19.153
I tell you to stay away from
my daughter or I'll have you fired.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.724
What you heard was:
"Take my daughter...

19:21.894 --> 19:24.829
come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel. "

19:25.197 --> 19:29.827
- Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
- No! Let me explain! Fired!

19:31.303 --> 19:33.965
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.068
But I want you to know...

19:38.744 --> 19:43.306
that you and I are not
all that different. I mean...

19:43.549 --> 19:46.245
I, too, am a "neat guy. "

19:55.861 --> 19:56.953
What?

19:59.164 --> 20:00.688
And I, too...

20:01.266 --> 20:03.461
am "just a love machine. "

20:27.292 --> 20:30.193
- Let me show you the guest room.
- Okay.

20:41.206 --> 20:44.141
I'm so sorry.
Please stop freaking out.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.701
I'm not freaking out.

20:49.047 --> 20:52.710
Why would I? A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.715
But that happens every day.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.951
Honey, we were at
this beautiful place...

21:01.159 --> 21:03.286
and I just put our names down for fun.

21:03.495 --> 21:06.259
- I mean, what's the harm in that?
- Right here.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.462
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.968
- Phoebe and Rachel thought..
- Phoebe and Rachel?

21:14.172 --> 21:17.539
So the people that knew about
our wedding before me were you...

21:17.743 --> 21:22.339
Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy, and some
band called the Starlight Magic Seven...

21:22.547 --> 21:24.674
who are available, by the way.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.185
It was a mistake.

21:28.453 --> 21:32.014
Please don't take this to mean
anything, because it doesn't.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.885
Okay.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.887
Really?

21:38.930 --> 21:42.525
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm not ready.

21:42.734 --> 21:43.723
I know.

21:44.202 --> 21:45.294
I know.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.196
Okay.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.198
All right.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.070
I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

21:52.577 --> 21:55.068
We were really worried about you.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.442
And that guy that
never delivered his burrito?

21:57.616 --> 22:00.084
He thought there was
some sort of connection.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.815
Did she buy it?

22:07.426 --> 22:08.450
Totally.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.891
- So did Hildy show you the place?
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.126
I can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.393
I know.

22:30.615 --> 22:33.140
- Hey, Gunther.
- Take these cappuccinos to table 11.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.946
And that guy wants some biscotti.

22:36.455 --> 22:39.549
I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.954
Do you still work here?

22:44.296 --> 22:46.890
No. I quit a long time ago.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.258
Did I forget to tell you that?
I'm sorry.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.396
- Cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
- Great!
