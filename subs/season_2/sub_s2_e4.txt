WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.095
Mom, would you relax?

00:04.371 --> 00:08.205
That was 10 blocks from here,
and any women won't walking alone at night.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.034
I would never do that.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.878
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

00:13.113 --> 00:16.446
This is a safe street. This is
a safe building. There's nothing

00:16.650 --> 00:19.642
Oh, my God! What are
you doing in here?!

00:19.887 --> 00:21.650
Mom, I gotta go! IT gotta go!

00:24.992 --> 00:25.981
Oh, my God!

00:27.362 --> 00:29.421
That's fine, you just read the paper.

00:30.165 --> 00:32.099
I'm gonna get a pot.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.365
It's not for you.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.073
Okay, that's fine.

00:43.011 --> 00:46.037
Read the Family Circus...

00:46.748 --> 00:49.581
...enjoy the gentle comedy....

00:53.354 --> 00:56.255
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God....

01:06.301 --> 01:07.928
It's open, you guys.

01:10.472 --> 01:11.439
Can I help you?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.732
Does Phoebe still live here?

01:13.942 --> 01:16.308
No, she doesn't. But I can get
a message to her.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.445
Great. Just tell her
her husband stopped by.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.114
Her what?

01:23.585 --> 01:25.109
How did you do that?

01:28.223 --> 01:30.157
The One With Phoebe's Husband

02:16.335 --> 02:19.600
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

02:19.839 --> 02:21.670
I'm not "married"
married, you know?

02:21.941 --> 02:23.568
He's just a friend, and he's gay...

02:23.776 --> 02:26.438
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.704
I can't believe you married Duncan!

02:28.915 --> 02:32.646
How could you not tell me?
We told each other everything.

02:32.852 --> 02:36.515
I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get judgmental...

02:36.756 --> 02:37.688
...and wouldn't approve.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.858
Of course I wouldn't approve!

02:40.092 --> 02:43.186
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.193
What the hell were you thinking?

02:45.398 --> 02:48.196
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.730
I wasn't in love with him.
I was helping out a friend.

02:52.972 --> 02:56.305
When he left town, you
stayed in your pajamas for a month.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.476
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

03:02.114 --> 03:03.240
Well, didn't you?

03:04.283 --> 03:05.875
I might have.

03:06.786 --> 03:09.084
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

03:09.288 --> 03:10.755
Like you tell me everything?

03:10.957 --> 03:12.948
What have I not told you?

03:13.426 --> 03:14.825
I don't know.

03:15.094 --> 03:18.996
The fact that the underwear out
on the telephone pole is yours...

03:19.298 --> 03:21.789
...from when you had sex
with Bobby on the terrace!

03:22.001 --> 03:23.161
What?

03:23.669 --> 03:25.261
Wait a minute! Who told you?

03:29.742 --> 03:31.505
You are dead meat.

03:31.911 --> 03:34.379
I didn't know it was a big secret.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.705
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.406
IKind of the same as, say...

03:38.751 --> 03:41.117
... I don't know, having
a third nipple!

03:43.422 --> 03:45.447
You have a third nipple?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.361
You bitch!

03:52.398 --> 03:54.195
Whip it out! Whip it out!

03:54.734 --> 03:58.636
There's nothing to see! It's a
tiny bump. It's totally useless.

03:58.871 --> 04:02.136
As opposed to your other
multi-functional nipples?

04:03.576 --> 04:06.739
I can't believe you!
You told me it was a nubbin.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.542
Joey, what did you think
a nubbin was?

04:11.784 --> 04:15.447
You see something, you hear a word,
I thought that's what it was.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.049
-Let me see it again!
-Yes, show us your nubbin!

04:19.592 --> 04:21.958
Joey was in a porno movie!

04:24.930 --> 04:27.558
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me!

04:28.968 --> 04:31.095
-Oh, my God!
-You were in a porno?!

04:32.138 --> 04:34.265
I was young and I just wanted a job.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.574
But I couldn't go through with it.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.911
They let me be the guy who fixes
the copier but can't...

04:40.112 --> 04:42.808
...because there's people
having sex on it.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.644
That is wild!

04:47.119 --> 04:49.144
-What's it shaped like?
-ls it hairy?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.355
What happens if you flick it?

04:58.931 --> 05:02.367
So does it do anything,
you know, special?

05:02.868 --> 05:05.996
Pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

05:06.205 --> 05:08.435
...to the magical land of Narnia.

05:09.542 --> 05:14.138
In some cultures, having a third nipple
is actually a sign of virility.

05:14.346 --> 05:17.110
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

05:18.050 --> 05:21.781
Are any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

05:22.488 --> 05:26.982
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

05:28.627 --> 05:32.393
Julie's so smart!
Julie's so special!

05:37.032 --> 05:40.092
I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

05:40.335 --> 05:43.771
But he's with her now.
You'll have to get over it.

05:44.039 --> 05:46.735
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

05:47.009 --> 05:50.536
I didn't know that's what I had to do.
I just have to get over it.

05:59.084 --> 06:01.109
-Sassy lady!
-Where are you going?

06:01.586 --> 06:04.749
I'm meeting Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

06:05.023 --> 06:06.923
He's in the Capades.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.193
-The lce Capades?
-No, the Gravel Capades.

06:12.898 --> 06:16.925
The turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

06:17.569 --> 06:19.264
I can't believe
you'd dress up for him.

06:19.471 --> 06:21.769
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

06:22.107 --> 06:23.802
Okay, no.

06:24.876 --> 06:29.370
For your information, I'm seeing him
so I can put those feelings behind me.

06:29.948 --> 06:33.440
The reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

06:33.652 --> 06:36.120
...to look nice for your gay husband.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.254
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.620
Chandler, will you fill me up here?

06:49.634 --> 06:53.434
I see, I see. Because of
the third-nipple thing.

07:01.146 --> 07:03.011
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.

07:04.349 --> 07:07.409
-See you later, Rach.
-Bye-bye, Julie.

07:17.696 --> 07:19.926
Come on, cut it out!

07:23.969 --> 07:26.460
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

07:28.206 --> 07:29.537
What?

07:30.509 --> 07:32.670
Come on, talk to me.

07:33.945 --> 07:38.712
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

07:40.218 --> 07:42.982
... having the sex?

07:44.322 --> 07:46.790
Why? Who's not?
Are you and Julie not?

07:46.992 --> 07:48.983
Are you and Julie not having sex?

07:51.663 --> 07:53.062
Technically?

07:53.698 --> 07:54.630
No.

07:57.135 --> 07:59.968
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

08:01.306 --> 08:05.174
Or because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

08:06.244 --> 08:10.180
No! She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

08:11.316 --> 08:14.808
We do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like

08:15.020 --> 08:17.682
No! Don't need to know the details.

08:19.591 --> 08:20.990
No, it's just....

08:21.526 --> 08:22.993
It's me.

08:23.195 --> 08:26.221
I've only been with
one woman my whole life...

08:26.498 --> 08:29.558
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

08:30.068 --> 08:33.526
So now I've got myself
all psyched out.

08:34.406 --> 08:36.271
It's become, like, this...

08:37.542 --> 08:39.169
...this thing!

08:41.580 --> 08:43.844
You must just think I'm weird.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.916
No, I don't think it's weird.

08:47.119 --> 08:49.610
I think, in fact....

08:49.855 --> 08:52.289
-ln fact, you know what I think?
-What?

08:53.058 --> 08:54.753
I think it's sexy.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.259
Sexy?

08:57.529 --> 08:59.622
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

08:59.898 --> 09:02.924
...there is nothing sexier...

09:03.201 --> 09:06.693
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

09:07.806 --> 09:08.830
No kidding?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.473
You know what I'd do?

09:10.709 --> 09:12.108
I'd wait.

09:13.945 --> 09:16.937
-You'd wait?
-Absolutely. I would wait...

09:17.315 --> 09:19.249
...and wait....

09:20.252 --> 09:21.913
Then I'd wait some more.

09:24.322 --> 09:25.414
Really?

09:25.624 --> 09:29.685
I don't care if she tells you
she wants it, she begs, she pleads...

09:29.895 --> 09:33.626
...she tells you she's gonna
have sex with another man

09:33.899 --> 09:35.491
That just means it's working.

09:38.837 --> 09:41.135
Women really want this?

09:41.406 --> 09:43.135
More than jewelry.

10:05.864 --> 10:08.094
Look at you! You look great!

10:08.466 --> 10:10.593
Do l? Thank you.

10:10.969 --> 10:13.631
So do you. Sparkly!

10:18.843 --> 10:22.335
This is pretty wonderful,
Mr. Major Capades Guy!

10:23.648 --> 10:28.278
I remember when you were just
King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

10:29.854 --> 10:31.549
You always said I'd make it.

10:31.823 --> 10:34.690
Well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way.

10:36.695 --> 10:37.992
Gosh, I missed you!

10:41.633 --> 10:43.624
-I'm gonna get changed.
-Okay.

10:46.571 --> 10:47.560
Now.

10:50.342 --> 10:52.469
Oh! Right. Okay.

10:53.211 --> 10:54.075
Ole!

10:54.713 --> 10:55.737
What?

10:57.249 --> 10:58.739
The Matador....

11:02.821 --> 11:04.083
Ole!

11:09.261 --> 11:11.661
Sweetie, can you
hold this for a second?

11:22.040 --> 11:24.941
Sorry, you had a
paleontologist on your face.

11:25.710 --> 11:27.905
But it's gone now.
You're all right.

11:28.113 --> 11:29.740
Hi, everyone.

11:32.751 --> 11:36.050
I wanted to thank you
for our little talk before.

11:36.254 --> 11:39.746
No problem! So you're gonna
go with the waiting thing?

11:40.025 --> 11:43.392
I was going to, but after
I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

11:48.199 --> 11:50.064
Good. What did he say?

11:50.302 --> 11:52.964
He told me to get over myself
and just do it.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.707
I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

11:56.908 --> 12:00.207
And his way, I get
to have sex tonight, so....

12:08.117 --> 12:10.449
What is this in my pocket?

12:11.153 --> 12:13.314
Why, it's Joey's porno movie!

12:15.991 --> 12:17.083
Pop it in!

12:17.993 --> 12:20.325
I'm fine, if you're
okay watching a video...

12:20.563 --> 12:22.827
...filled with two-nippled people.

12:26.268 --> 12:29.066
People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

12:29.471 --> 12:31.496
What's wrong with people having sex?

12:34.343 --> 12:38.905
Well, you know, these
movies are offensive...

12:39.148 --> 12:43.517
...and degrading
to women and females....

12:45.421 --> 12:48.754
And the lighting's
always unflattering.

12:51.694 --> 12:54.788
-Monica, help me out here.
-Hell, I wanna see Joey!

13:01.704 --> 13:05.765
So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right

13:05.975 --> 13:07.840
Oh. Never mind.

13:08.143 --> 13:11.772
Wait a minute. That is the craziest
typing test I've ever seen.

13:13.549 --> 13:15.881
All I say is, she'd
better get the job.

13:16.185 --> 13:19.154
Looks to me like he's
the one getting the job.

13:21.390 --> 13:22.721
Here I come.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.721
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

13:25.027 --> 13:28.724
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

13:30.499 --> 13:32.865
So I just watch them have sex.

13:36.372 --> 13:37.839
Then I say Here's my line!

13:38.207 --> 13:40.641
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

13:43.145 --> 13:44.635
Nice work, my friend!

13:44.847 --> 13:48.715
Wait, you see me again. Hang on,
the guy's butt's blocking me.

13:50.085 --> 13:53.748
There I am. There I am.
There I am....

14:01.030 --> 14:04.022
So what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

14:10.039 --> 14:12.200
I kind of need a divorce.

14:12.608 --> 14:13.768
O...

14:14.243 --> 14:15.437
... kay.

14:16.011 --> 14:16.943
How come?

14:18.247 --> 14:20.943
Actually, I'm getting married again.

14:21.216 --> 14:22.410
What?

14:22.618 --> 14:24.609
I don't know how to tell you this.

14:27.022 --> 14:28.546
I'm straight.

14:32.628 --> 14:35.961
I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

14:36.198 --> 14:38.598
You're so smart and funny...

14:38.801 --> 14:41.702
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties!

14:41.904 --> 14:44.270
That's what I kept telling myself.

14:44.540 --> 14:47.976
But you reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

14:49.311 --> 14:51.541
How long have you known?

14:53.215 --> 14:56.651
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

14:57.619 --> 14:59.712
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

14:59.955 --> 15:04.654
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends
are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

15:07.896 --> 15:10.626
And there's actually a woman?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.631
Her name's Debra.

15:16.305 --> 15:19.240
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

15:20.976 --> 15:23.001
I've never told you this...

15:24.146 --> 15:28.412
... but there were one
or two times back in college when...

15:28.617 --> 15:30.676
... I'd get drunk,
go to a straight bar...

15:30.919 --> 15:33.479
...and wake up with
a woman next to me.

15:34.156 --> 15:38.593
I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

15:40.095 --> 15:41.119
Sure.

15:41.330 --> 15:45.130
Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way!

15:48.437 --> 15:50.928
I don't know what to say.

15:51.173 --> 15:54.939
You're married to someone for
six years and you think you know him.

15:55.210 --> 15:58.043
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay!"

16:03.452 --> 16:05.647
I'm still me.

16:07.689 --> 16:11.181
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

16:13.796 --> 16:16.390
You know, it still
smells like monkey in there.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.994
That saves us the conversation.

16:22.905 --> 16:25.635
This has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

16:25.841 --> 16:28.036
Me too. We should get going.

16:28.343 --> 16:30.868
No! Come on, you guys!

16:32.347 --> 16:34.577
Come on, it's only 1 1 :30.

16:34.850 --> 16:38.911
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

16:39.221 --> 16:41.655
Rachel, that's all we do.

16:43.358 --> 16:46.020
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

16:47.362 --> 16:48.920
What about Julie?

16:49.364 --> 16:53.164
You have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

16:53.769 --> 16:55.669
...and we don't really know you.

16:55.904 --> 16:57.428
I mean, who is Julie?

16:58.941 --> 17:01.068
What do you like?
What don't you like?

17:01.276 --> 17:03.506
We want to know everything.

17:03.846 --> 17:05.746
Well, that could take awhile.

17:06.348 --> 17:07.508
So?

17:09.118 --> 17:12.519
Who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

17:12.788 --> 17:15.120
I got the time to get to know Julie.

17:17.392 --> 17:19.451
I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

17:22.397 --> 17:23.625
That's fine.

17:23.866 --> 17:27.529
Let's start with your childhood.
What was that like?

17:28.871 --> 17:29.803
In a nutshell

17:34.443 --> 17:37.105
So, have you told your parents?

17:37.613 --> 17:40.605
No, but it'll be okay.
They're pretty cool.

17:40.816 --> 17:43.148
My brother's straight, so....

17:44.720 --> 17:46.085
Here you go.

17:46.321 --> 17:48.881
You know what?
I just have one more question.

17:49.291 --> 17:54.228
If you had figured this out sooner,
and I had been around...

17:54.496 --> 17:57.226
...do you think l
would have been the one...?

17:59.067 --> 18:00.261
No. Don't tell me.

18:00.502 --> 18:04.461
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

18:06.475 --> 18:07.635
I love you, Phoebe.

18:22.958 --> 18:25.324
So your brother's straight, huh?

18:26.929 --> 18:28.021
Seriously.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.934
and my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

18:35.137 --> 18:37.765
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

18:38.607 --> 18:40.131
Mrs. Gobb?

18:40.375 --> 18:43.003
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

18:46.181 --> 18:48.274
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

18:48.517 --> 18:49.882
I'm going home.

18:55.157 --> 18:57.387
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

18:59.528 --> 19:00.790
Good night.

19:04.366 --> 19:07.460
It's pretty late. You're
probably not still planning on....

19:08.503 --> 19:09.902
No, I am.

19:11.039 --> 19:13.405
Are you nervous?

19:15.844 --> 19:17.709
I have done it before.

19:19.181 --> 19:21.513
I mean, how are
you gonna handle it?

19:21.717 --> 19:25.813
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

19:27.089 --> 19:29.319
I don't know. I guess
I'm just gonna...

19:29.992 --> 19:32.256
...see what happens.

19:33.528 --> 19:35.393
Good luck!

19:37.899 --> 19:38.888
What?

19:39.434 --> 19:40.765
Nothing....

19:41.903 --> 19:46.897
It is your first time with her,
and if the first time doesn't go well...

19:47.276 --> 19:51.042
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

19:53.181 --> 19:55.206
Okay, now I'm nervous.

19:57.753 --> 19:59.345
Maybe you should put it off.

20:00.022 --> 20:02.286
No, I don't want to put it off!

20:06.695 --> 20:09.960
I spent last year being
so unbelievably miserable.

20:10.232 --> 20:13.099
And now I'm actually happy.

20:15.070 --> 20:17.061
You know, I mean really happy.

20:17.639 --> 20:19.402
I just don't wanna....

20:19.941 --> 20:22.705
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

20:24.813 --> 20:26.041
I know.

20:29.117 --> 20:30.607
I'm sorry.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.912
It's not your fault.

20:33.322 --> 20:34.380
Right.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.154
Maybe it doesn't
have to be this tough.

20:39.761 --> 20:44.755
Maybe you were on the right track
with that whole "spontaneous" thing.

20:45.233 --> 20:48.168
-Women really like that.
-Really?

20:51.073 --> 20:54.440
I mean if it were me,
I'd want you to....

20:55.010 --> 20:58.810
I don't know, catch me off guard
with a really...

20:59.514 --> 21:00.845
...good kiss.

21:03.618 --> 21:07.520
Really sort of soft at first.

21:08.657 --> 21:13.594
And then maybe brush
the hair away from my face.

21:14.096 --> 21:18.192
And then look far into my eyes...

21:18.467 --> 21:21.095
...in a way that lets me
know something...

21:22.337 --> 21:24.601
...amazing is about to happen.

21:31.179 --> 21:33.147
And then, I don't know, then...

21:33.348 --> 21:36.317
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

21:36.518 --> 21:40.045
...so that I'd be pressed up
right against you.

21:42.491 --> 21:44.652
And it would get kind of...

21:46.395 --> 21:47.987
...sweaty...

21:50.365 --> 21:51.730
...and blurry.

21:54.736 --> 21:57.000
And then it's just happening.

22:04.146 --> 22:05.909
Thanks, Rach. Good night!

22:10.252 --> 22:11.981
Oh, God!

22:27.269 --> 22:28.668
Good morning!

22:29.838 --> 22:32.830
Well, somebody got some last night!

22:37.813 --> 22:39.144
Twice!
