WEBVTT

00:03.383 --> 00:04.748
Hey, what's going on?

00:05.018 --> 00:07.316
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

00:07.521 --> 00:10.581
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar."

00:10.824 --> 00:12.314
Yeah, I'll take that.

00:13.093 --> 00:14.185
What's up?

00:14.394 --> 00:17.886
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

00:22.436 --> 00:24.927
Congratulations. Where is she?

00:25.205 --> 00:27.935
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

00:29.376 --> 00:32.072
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

00:32.346 --> 00:35.042
I thought it was a kid yelling,
"I'm gay!"

00:36.950 --> 00:38.781
No, that guy moved.

00:40.087 --> 00:43.420
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

00:43.757 --> 00:47.591
I'm getting married!
I'm gonna be a bride!

00:49.029 --> 00:53.557
No, I will not shut up,
because I'm engaged!

00:53.800 --> 00:57.793
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

00:58.038 --> 01:00.734
My fiance will kick your ass.

01:02.442 --> 01:05.343
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

01:06.947 --> 01:10.246
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

01:11.752 --> 01:13.845
The One with Monica's Thunder

01:48.722 --> 01:51.020
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:53.994 --> 01:58.522
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

01:58.765 --> 02:02.098
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

02:02.803 --> 02:04.293
Our special night.

02:05.005 --> 02:08.304
It just wouldn't be my night...
Our night...

02:08.542 --> 02:12.410
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

02:12.646 --> 02:16.047
It's okay,
I want this to be your night too.

02:16.450 --> 02:17.940
To Monica.

02:18.218 --> 02:20.015
Come on, wait, stop it.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.582
Okay, to Monica.

02:24.257 --> 02:28.626
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding? Because I'm kind of musical.

02:29.463 --> 02:32.955
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

02:33.166 --> 02:36.533
Speaking of chiming in, remember the time
you burned down my apartment?

02:38.238 --> 02:40.035
Yeah, you're on your own.

02:40.740 --> 02:44.437
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.072
I can't stay too long.

02:48.315 --> 02:51.751
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

02:51.985 --> 02:54.613
I'm supposed to be playing
a 19-year-old.

02:56.790 --> 02:57.814
What?

02:58.058 --> 03:01.494
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

03:03.463 --> 03:05.260
You guys don't think I look 19?

03:08.268 --> 03:10.702
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

03:14.374 --> 03:16.501
Okay, everybody, let's go.

03:20.213 --> 03:22.272
Is my candy bar around here?

03:22.516 --> 03:23.847
No, you ate it all.

03:24.084 --> 03:26.143
I was afraid of that.

03:34.194 --> 03:36.992
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

03:37.230 --> 03:38.891
Diamond shoes.

03:41.234 --> 03:43.293
You're not getting dressed.

03:48.542 --> 03:49.975
Know what I mean?

03:52.145 --> 03:54.613
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

03:54.814 --> 03:56.475
There's gonna be a wedding.

03:56.716 --> 03:58.240
You're gonna be the bride.

03:58.485 --> 04:02.683
200 people are gonna be looking at you
in a clean, white dress.

04:03.623 --> 04:05.113
Let's do it.

04:11.031 --> 04:14.364
So are you the fairest one of all?

04:14.668 --> 04:18.297
- I can still play 19, right?
- Yeah, but you gotta dress younger.

04:18.471 --> 04:21.167
If you wear the right clothes,
you can look any age.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.275
- Really?
- Yeah. I work in fashion...

04:23.443 --> 04:25.411
...and fashion is all about youth.

04:26.179 --> 04:28.306
Fashion is about me?

04:28.481 --> 04:31.177
About youth. Youth!
Listen up, grandpa.

04:40.226 --> 04:43.093
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

04:44.631 --> 04:47.225
You're tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

04:47.434 --> 04:49.334
Don't worry about it.

04:51.338 --> 04:54.796
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

04:55.609 --> 04:58.203
You know? It's like biology.

04:58.411 --> 05:01.938
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

05:02.215 --> 05:04.979
...and tonight biology failed me.

05:07.020 --> 05:11.150
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in. Okay.

05:12.726 --> 05:17.095
Twelve years old and addicted to pork

05:17.263 --> 05:20.232
No one thought Monica would marry

05:22.002 --> 05:25.460
She knew her way
Around a knife and a fork

05:25.639 --> 05:27.266
Phoebe, that's great, but...

05:27.440 --> 05:31.240
So you're not convinced. That's all right
because I got another one.

05:32.946 --> 05:37.940
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

05:39.252 --> 05:44.383
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

05:46.526 --> 05:47.959
Phoebe, no.

05:48.428 --> 05:52.660
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

05:55.201 --> 05:59.160
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

06:02.942 --> 06:04.705
Hey, you look great.

06:04.911 --> 06:06.435
Thanks.

06:07.113 --> 06:08.375
You okay over there?

06:09.816 --> 06:12.910
I don't know. You know?
I feel a little...

06:15.588 --> 06:18.113
You know what? Never mind.
I'll be fine.

06:18.391 --> 06:23.124
Don't worry about it. You're probably
tired, you had a lot of champagne.

06:24.197 --> 06:25.960
It happens to everybody.

06:31.271 --> 06:34.297
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

06:34.574 --> 06:37.737
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

06:37.944 --> 06:41.004
Well, sure,
but I get married all the time.

06:44.317 --> 06:46.808
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

06:48.722 --> 06:51.486
Do you think we'll ever have that?

06:52.625 --> 06:54.456
You mean "we," you and me?

06:54.661 --> 06:57.027
Oh, no, no, no.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.527
"We," you with someone,
me with someone.

06:59.766 --> 07:01.427
Good, you scared me a minute.

07:01.668 --> 07:03.499
I know. Shake it off.

07:04.471 --> 07:08.737
It's just because you and I,
we were like a nightmare.

07:10.877 --> 07:15.371
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like, there was...

07:17.450 --> 07:21.443
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

07:22.956 --> 07:25.390
Oh, well, yes.

07:25.658 --> 07:28.525
I can think of one good thing.

07:32.265 --> 07:35.826
You were always good at the...

07:37.670 --> 07:40.002
...stuff.

07:45.545 --> 07:46.807
I was good at the stuff?

07:48.648 --> 07:50.411
I really liked your hands.

07:50.683 --> 07:52.310
My hands?

07:55.588 --> 07:57.055
Way to go, guys.

07:59.359 --> 08:01.486
You were really good at the stuff too.

08:01.728 --> 08:03.161
Oh, I know.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.533
What are you thinking about?

08:09.702 --> 08:11.897
Just some stuff.

08:12.772 --> 08:14.933
Hey, you know what we never did?

08:16.242 --> 08:17.334
Oh, no, not that.

08:18.878 --> 08:20.709
We never had a bonus night.

08:20.914 --> 08:22.438
- A what?
- You know, a bonus night.

08:22.615 --> 08:26.449
Two people break up, but they
get back together for one night.

08:27.053 --> 08:31.422
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

08:31.624 --> 08:34.752
- Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
- No.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.060
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

08:47.173 --> 08:49.300
I'm sure it would be amazing...

08:49.509 --> 08:52.774
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

08:53.012 --> 08:54.775
I really...

08:55.582 --> 08:57.243
...really...

08:57.817 --> 08:59.512
...don't.

09:07.093 --> 09:10.585
Well, at least I can still do some things.

09:24.544 --> 09:25.704
'Sup?

09:29.215 --> 09:30.842
'Sup, dude?

09:31.751 --> 09:34.413
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

09:36.623 --> 09:38.955
You playing
a little PlayStation, huh?

09:39.959 --> 09:41.392
That's whack.

09:43.429 --> 09:46.398
PlayStation is whack.

09:48.434 --> 09:50.959
'Sup with the whack PlayStation,
'sup?

09:54.207 --> 09:56.835
Come on, am I 19 or what?

09:57.110 --> 10:01.479
Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten
being the dumbest a person can look...

10:01.748 --> 10:03.716
...you are definitely 19.

10:05.151 --> 10:06.743
Come on, really. How old?

10:06.953 --> 10:09.547
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

10:09.756 --> 10:14.887
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

10:15.662 --> 10:17.289
Thanks.

10:27.607 --> 10:30.303
You've had a lot of sex, right?

10:33.413 --> 10:35.244
When, today?

10:37.951 --> 10:40.078
Some, not a lot.

10:41.521 --> 10:45.252
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a...

10:45.825 --> 10:47.520
I was unable to...

10:47.927 --> 10:51.090
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

10:52.565 --> 10:56.661
I cannot believe I'm asking advice
from somebody who's wearing that hat.

11:00.039 --> 11:01.973
I had an incident.

11:03.543 --> 11:06.603
Don't worry about that, man.
That happens.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.379
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

11:10.950 --> 11:14.317
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

11:18.358 --> 11:21.020
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

11:21.527 --> 11:22.892
Come on.

11:24.964 --> 11:26.454
Why aren't you dressed yet?

11:26.733 --> 11:29.224
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.

11:29.469 --> 11:30.766
Check this out.

11:31.104 --> 11:33.299
If you get ready now, you can play.

11:33.539 --> 11:34.597
- Really?!
- Yes.

11:34.807 --> 11:37.298
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

11:37.577 --> 11:42.173
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'll have to pound on you a little bit.

11:42.682 --> 11:45.310
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'll get everybody.

11:45.551 --> 11:48.452
Finally we can start celebrating my...

11:52.291 --> 11:55.454
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

12:00.233 --> 12:03.361
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

12:03.603 --> 12:07.334
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

12:08.641 --> 12:11.109
I waited my whole life
to be engaged...

12:11.477 --> 12:14.640
...and unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

12:16.649 --> 12:21.780
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I
hoped tonight could just be about that.

12:21.988 --> 12:23.785
But it is just about that.

12:23.990 --> 12:26.424
Now it's about you
getting back together.

12:26.626 --> 12:29.288
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

12:30.229 --> 12:34.131
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.631
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.

12:39.138 --> 12:40.400
That's true.

12:41.274 --> 12:43.572
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.072
You guys kissed?!

12:47.080 --> 12:48.945
What does this mean?!

12:49.148 --> 12:52.117
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

12:53.486 --> 12:55.386
Thunder being stolen.

12:55.588 --> 12:59.149
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

12:59.425 --> 13:02.326
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

13:02.595 --> 13:03.926
Oh, my God.

13:05.965 --> 13:08.763
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

13:08.968 --> 13:11.835
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and a woman.

13:13.706 --> 13:17.437
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

13:20.646 --> 13:23.672
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

13:24.617 --> 13:27.211
No, but let's talk about it.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.783
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

13:31.124 --> 13:33.422
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

13:33.626 --> 13:34.684
No, it's not huge.

13:34.961 --> 13:37.828
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

13:38.097 --> 13:40.292
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.425
We're still talking about it.

13:42.668 --> 13:45.102
That and Chandler's problem.

13:46.639 --> 13:48.334
Monica, listen, listen.

13:48.574 --> 13:52.203
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

13:52.445 --> 13:54.310
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

13:54.580 --> 13:57.515
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

13:58.117 --> 13:59.675
Yes, you can pass for 19.

13:59.886 --> 14:01.376
- Really?
- Yes.

14:01.854 --> 14:03.651
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

14:03.890 --> 14:08.850
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

14:11.998 --> 14:13.659
I'm 30!

14:15.234 --> 14:17.293
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

14:18.738 --> 14:20.205
Oh, crap!

14:21.474 --> 14:25.638
So the Plaza. We'll get some mai
tais? Maybe no more for you though.

14:28.681 --> 14:31.912
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

14:32.151 --> 14:33.880
Monica, this is ridiculous.

14:34.387 --> 14:38.255
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.818
That is whack.

14:56.342 --> 14:57.900
I'll play it at the wedding.

14:58.144 --> 15:01.545
We'll see if they actually
let you play.

15:01.781 --> 15:04.147
They tell you anything
you want to hear...

15:04.383 --> 15:06.044
...like, "You look 19."

15:06.285 --> 15:09.948
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't."

15:11.424 --> 15:13.392
Monica won't take this away.

15:14.093 --> 15:16.357
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

15:17.096 --> 15:18.529
Would she?

15:19.865 --> 15:21.594
Would she?

15:21.767 --> 15:23.098
Would she?

15:23.269 --> 15:26.136
It's starting
to sound like "wood cheese."

15:26.973 --> 15:29.965
Man, I could go
for some wood cheese right now.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.645
Guess who.

15:38.684 --> 15:42.848
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

15:43.189 --> 15:44.520
What did Monica mean:

15:44.757 --> 15:46.884
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

15:47.159 --> 15:50.094
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

15:50.463 --> 15:51.555
Still thinking about it?

15:51.797 --> 15:55.255
I'm serious. What did she mean
by that? "Especially you."

15:55.468 --> 15:57.436
- Who cares?
- I care.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.069
And so do I.

16:02.975 --> 16:06.069
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

16:09.715 --> 16:11.706
Am I going to let you watch me?

16:11.917 --> 16:13.043
No.

16:14.987 --> 16:17.455
I can't believe her.
It's just so typical.

16:17.723 --> 16:21.989
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

16:22.228 --> 16:26.289
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

16:26.565 --> 16:29.966
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

16:30.202 --> 16:34.798
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

16:38.077 --> 16:39.135
Keep talking.

16:39.345 --> 16:42.473
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

16:42.715 --> 16:46.913
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

16:48.854 --> 16:50.116
I love you.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.730
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

17:06.172 --> 17:08.732
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?

17:12.278 --> 17:14.007
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

17:14.246 --> 17:17.682
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

17:19.318 --> 17:22.515
You know, some good-faith money
to hold the date.

17:22.755 --> 17:24.950
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

17:25.491 --> 17:27.891
Oh, I see.

17:29.862 --> 17:31.853
They break your heart, don't they?

17:33.165 --> 17:35.998
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

17:36.202 --> 17:39.262
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

17:39.472 --> 17:42.270
Yeah, and if you want to look 19,
then you...

17:42.475 --> 17:45.069
You got to do something
about your eyes.

17:45.311 --> 17:47.074
What's wrong with my eyes?

17:47.313 --> 17:50.646
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

17:54.553 --> 17:57.215
Put some tea bags on them
for 15 minutes.

17:57.423 --> 18:00.859
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

18:03.729 --> 18:06.892
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.

18:11.570 --> 18:13.697
What did you mean
when you said...

18:13.939 --> 18:16.737
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

18:16.942 --> 18:21.538
What a great apology.
And you accept. Bye-bye.

18:22.915 --> 18:26.373
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

18:26.585 --> 18:30.248
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

18:30.823 --> 18:32.552
Hey, here's a thought...

18:33.893 --> 18:36.191
Monica, what are you talking about?

18:36.395 --> 18:39.558
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

18:39.765 --> 18:41.733
Third base.

18:43.068 --> 18:45.263
It was all everybody could talk about.

18:45.471 --> 18:49.464
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

18:50.776 --> 18:52.107
We had a caricaturist.

18:55.247 --> 18:58.739
Whenever I get married
Guess who won't be asked to sing

18:58.984 --> 19:03.421
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

19:07.226 --> 19:10.787
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

19:10.996 --> 19:12.759
Yet here you are doing it again.

19:12.965 --> 19:15.297
I don't want
to steal your stupid thunder.

19:15.568 --> 19:18.401
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

19:18.604 --> 19:20.299
Got me.

19:21.640 --> 19:25.736
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.573
It'd be nice if I could
have this night.

19:29.782 --> 19:31.977
I never wanted any part of your night.

19:32.184 --> 19:33.776
No one was supposed to see us.

19:33.986 --> 19:37.683
Is that why you did it in the secret
hallway, where nobody ever goes?

19:39.325 --> 19:41.122
Rachel, I've been thinking.

19:41.327 --> 19:45.661
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

19:45.931 --> 19:48.024
I'm calling it off.

19:49.468 --> 19:51.800
Way to save your dignity, my man.

19:53.038 --> 19:57.805
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

19:58.010 --> 20:00.604
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

20:00.846 --> 20:03.474
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.

20:03.716 --> 20:04.944
Maybe you can't stand...

20:05.184 --> 20:08.347
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married before you.

20:08.554 --> 20:12.923
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

20:13.158 --> 20:15.183
Now I want to steal your thunder.

20:15.461 --> 20:18.055
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

20:27.840 --> 20:31.207
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

20:31.443 --> 20:33.138
Well, somebody should.

20:36.315 --> 20:38.215
Look, if we're gonna do this...

20:38.450 --> 20:41.010
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.

20:41.220 --> 20:43.450
I see, so everybody wins.

20:46.091 --> 20:47.956
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.652
Okay, Ross, stop it.
Please, wait a minute.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.258
Yeah, you like that, baby?

21:01.006 --> 21:02.200
May we help you?

21:02.875 --> 21:07.335
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

21:07.580 --> 21:10.606
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

21:10.849 --> 21:13.113
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

21:13.986 --> 21:16.682
How is that ever going to happen?

21:17.089 --> 21:19.887
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

21:20.125 --> 21:21.422
- I know why.
- You don't.

21:21.627 --> 21:24.790
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

21:25.431 --> 21:26.489
What do you mean?

21:26.932 --> 21:29.799
Look, I am so...

21:30.035 --> 21:33.368
...so happy for you guys.

21:33.572 --> 21:37.372
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

21:37.610 --> 21:39.077
I'm not even close.

21:39.278 --> 21:42.406
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

21:42.615 --> 21:45.709
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

21:45.951 --> 21:48.419
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

21:50.623 --> 21:52.750
I don't care, she slept with me.

21:54.259 --> 21:58.821
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

22:00.466 --> 22:03.594
I'm sorry I almost made you
sleep with Ross.

22:09.041 --> 22:11.066
I'm gonna take off.

22:13.045 --> 22:15.070
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

22:15.781 --> 22:17.442
And Rachel...

22:18.083 --> 22:19.141
...what can I say?

22:19.351 --> 22:21.148
You missed your chance.

22:21.420 --> 22:26.551
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

22:43.742 --> 22:46.540
We thought Phoebe would leave

22:46.745 --> 22:49.578
But she just stayed and stayed

22:49.848 --> 22:52.078
That's right, I'm here all night

22:52.351 --> 22:53.875
And Chandler will never get...

22:54.086 --> 22:56.680
Hey, here's a dollar.

22:56.955 --> 22:59.719
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.721
Thank you.

23:02.861 --> 23:06.058
Now who will perform the ceremony

23:06.265 --> 23:09.325
Who will perform the cer...

23:12.037 --> 23:14.267
I'll pound on him in the morning.

23:16.442 --> 23:17.431
