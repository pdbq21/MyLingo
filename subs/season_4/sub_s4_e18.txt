WEBVTT

00:04.404 --> 00:06.235
It is true what they say:

00:06.439 --> 00:08.202
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

00:12.112 --> 00:16.708
I'm so pregnant that
my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

00:16.916 --> 00:19.441
So I'm going to play my songs
on this drum.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.550
It sounds really cool!

00:21.788 --> 00:24.052
Listen, listen.

00:25.825 --> 00:29.124
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:29.429 --> 00:32.762
What are they feeding you?

00:38.838 --> 00:39.998
That sounds great!

00:40.206 --> 00:43.573
I know! And I've only
been playing for an hour.

00:48.748 --> 00:52.445
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you a big favor.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.388
Don't tell me you want to keep
more stuff in my uterus.

01:00.126 --> 01:01.787
Okay. Now, see.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.725
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

01:04.964 --> 01:08.661
And Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

01:08.935 --> 01:10.562
...Frank Jr., Jr.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.838
Wouldn't that be Frank lll?

01:14.274 --> 01:15.901
Don't get me started.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.738
Anyway, since there
are three babies...

01:20.980 --> 01:23.471
...and we both got
to put our names in...

01:23.683 --> 01:28.177
...we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.087
That's so nice!

01:31.691 --> 01:32.783
Cougar.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.125
Think about it.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.434
The One with Rachel's New Dress

02:27.680 --> 02:29.648
I left a bra drying in there.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.578
Will your son think it's yours
and be traumatized?

02:32.752 --> 02:36.654
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.788
It's time to go.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.621
See, that clock's a little fast.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.127
We still have 17 minutes.

02:45.431 --> 02:48.229
What can we do in 17 minutes...

02:48.468 --> 02:49.833
...twice?

02:50.803 --> 02:52.896
Well, that's ambitious.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.138
You can ignore that.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.706
That's your son.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.880
Believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.683
I'll be right there.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.093
This is Carol and Susan.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.355
-It's so nice to finally meet you.
-You too.

03:18.598 --> 03:23.160
-Susan will be in London next week.
-I've never been there.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.199
-I'll show you around.
-Great!

03:25.538 --> 03:28.666
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.807
There's tons of terrific stuff.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.934
I'll go with you.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.608
Look at you two bonding.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.544
Making us late for the airport.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.375
Are you all right?

03:41.588 --> 03:44.921
It's just us getting along
is difficult for him...

03:45.191 --> 03:47.421
...because he doesn't like me.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.584
Come on. That's....

03:49.862 --> 03:51.056
It's true.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.335
How did we lose?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.776
Do we have a baby name yet?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.279
No. It's so hard!

04:10.583 --> 04:12.847
I went through this book
and found nothing.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.522
I want a name that's
really strong and confident.

04:16.823 --> 04:18.814
You know? Like...Exxon!

04:20.994 --> 04:23.622
It certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.

04:25.031 --> 04:28.694
You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

04:29.969 --> 04:34.497
I'm not sure about Hulk,
but I like a name starting with "The".

04:36.009 --> 04:38.273
You want a good name,
go with Joey.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.343
Joey's your pal, your buddy.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.841
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!

04:44.550 --> 04:47.678
If you're going to name him Joey,
you should name him Chandler.

04:49.355 --> 04:52.813
Chandler's funny, sophisticated,
and very lovable...

04:53.026 --> 04:55.358
...once you get to know him.

04:56.195 --> 04:57.685
Joey's lovable too.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.492
But with Joey, if you need him,
he'll be there.

05:01.701 --> 05:05.728
Chandler will be there too.
He might be a little late...

05:06.172 --> 05:08.970
...but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you cold soda...

05:09.208 --> 05:12.336
...if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.142
What do you say?

05:15.381 --> 05:19.750
I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

05:20.019 --> 05:23.250
Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.189
All right, I don't

05:30.430 --> 05:32.728
Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.

05:34.367 --> 05:38.497
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I wanted to name my kid that.

05:42.041 --> 05:46.569
If you hoped to sleep with Joshua,
which one would you wear?

05:46.879 --> 05:50.815
It creeps me out choosing
other people's sex clothes.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.146
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.356
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair colored.

05:57.590 --> 06:01.151
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.090
What am I making him, by the way?

06:03.563 --> 06:07.795
A frisee salad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

06:08.067 --> 06:11.935
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.296
I thought I was making him
filet mignon.

06:15.808 --> 06:19.574
You decided to make salmon
because you had some left over.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.975
Then you realized if you bitched,
then you would stop cooking...

06:23.249 --> 06:27.481
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.618
I really get crabby when I cook.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.957
Why go through all this trouble?
He's a guy.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.119
You'd serve the potato and he'd
still want to have sex with you.

06:37.296 --> 06:40.197
That is not how I operate.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.343
We've got to get a new game.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.139
So Emily called last night.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.908
And now you're giving me the message?

07:03.489 --> 07:07.823
Turns out that Emily is
just crazy about Susan.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.921
They're going
to the theater together.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.459
They're going to dinner.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.860
They're going horseback riding!

07:16.936 --> 07:19.166
God, Susan is so fun!

07:22.708 --> 07:25.506
Look, this is just
a little too familiar.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.872
For six months
before Carol and I split up...

07:29.182 --> 07:33.312
...all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart.

07:33.519 --> 07:37.615
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."

07:38.624 --> 07:41.787
You think something could happen
between Emily and Susan?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.895
Hey, they're going
to the gym together!

07:46.566 --> 07:48.056
Two women...

07:48.334 --> 07:49.961
...stretching!

07:51.070 --> 07:55.336
They take a steam, things get playful.
Didn't you see Personal Best?

07:55.541 --> 07:57.406
No, but I'm gonna!

07:59.812 --> 08:02.042
Hi! You're crazy.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.979
Emily is straight.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.687
How do you know?
We thought Carol was straight.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.689
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.720
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down!

08:19.532 --> 08:21.932
No, I meant for the baby.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.029
What's wrong with Ross?

08:27.573 --> 08:31.703
Something like this would never
happen to The Hulk, you know.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.380
That's not true.

08:35.581 --> 08:40.575
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found....

08:41.854 --> 08:42.843
You know....

08:43.055 --> 08:45.580
Never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

08:48.227 --> 08:52.061
I'm definitely going to go
with either Joey or Chandler.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.962
You gotta pick Joey!

08:55.268 --> 08:57.736
Name one famous person
named Chandler.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.193
Raymond Chandler.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.635
Someone you didn't make up.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.740
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for...

09:06.045 --> 09:07.376
...Joey Buttafucco.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.281
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.648
How about a compromise then?
What if it's...

09:15.922 --> 09:17.719
...Chan-no-ey?

09:18.157 --> 09:21.490
Joey? Think about it.
He'll never be President.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.161
There will never be a President Joey.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.989
I didn't want to bring this up.

09:27.266 --> 09:31.293
Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life!

09:31.504 --> 09:34.405
It's not a name!
It's barely even a word.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.598
It's like chandelier
but it's not!

09:39.011 --> 09:42.469
Then, you put it together with Bing
and forget about it.

09:42.648 --> 09:46.379
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

09:50.823 --> 09:54.623
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.661
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.832
So I guess it's Joey then.

10:12.411 --> 10:15.175
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.411
Please! Cooking soothes me.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.885
So dig in!

10:25.391 --> 10:28.258
It all looks so good.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.419
Oh, my God.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.100
I know.
My God, this rice is so

10:35.401 --> 10:37.198
I am so good!

10:38.037 --> 10:39.470
Behind you.

10:40.539 --> 10:44.635
They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

10:45.811 --> 10:49.542
Is there some way
that they could not be here?

10:49.782 --> 10:52.615
Farm birds really
kind of freak me out!

10:57.156 --> 10:58.248
Here we go.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.755
There you go!

11:13.673 --> 11:16.403
Hey! How'd you do that?

11:19.779 --> 11:21.178
All gone.

11:21.647 --> 11:22.909
So, farm birds, huh?

11:23.616 --> 11:26.312
It's my only weird thing, I swear.

11:26.585 --> 11:30.419
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.597
Can I serve you a little

11:40.833 --> 11:42.095
What?

11:42.334 --> 11:43.323
Nothing.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.596
It's just that I know
that they're still out there.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.500
They're across the hall.
That's two doors away.

11:51.777 --> 11:55.543
It'll take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.341
That's not funny.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.123
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

12:06.358 --> 12:10.226
We could pack this stuff up
and go to your apartment.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.488
They're working on it.
It's a mess.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.701
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.531
They're out of town.

12:19.538 --> 12:23.167
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.138
It'd be very romantic.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.979
-What do you say?
-Yeah, that works.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.748
They can smell the fear.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.549
How's Ben?

12:39.725 --> 12:41.886
I asked if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.527
I asked if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.528
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.530
So he's sweeping.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.067
Any word from Susan?

12:56.509 --> 12:59.535
She said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.540
By the by, did it
ever occur to you that...

13:06.852 --> 13:10.879
...maybe they might be having
a little too much fun?

13:11.090 --> 13:12.387
What's too much fun?

13:12.591 --> 13:16.083
The kind of fun you and Susan had
when we were married.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.456
Oh, my God!
You are so paranoid.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.097
Am l?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.626
Am l?

13:23.536 --> 13:27.563
Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.275
Carol, so were we.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.472
Just imagine for a moment...

13:33.879 --> 13:37.406
...that Susan meets someone,
and they hit it off.

13:37.650 --> 13:42.110
They're coming back from the theater,
and they stop at a pub for drinks.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.652
They're laughing.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.155
Someone innocently
touches someone else.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.559
There's electricity.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.627
It's new. It's exciting.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.358
Are you saying there isn't
the slightest possibility...

13:55.634 --> 13:57.431
...of something happening?

13:59.004 --> 14:00.369
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God!

14:00.639 --> 14:04.097
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it!

14:08.380 --> 14:13.044
None of the other kids believed me,
but I swear that duck pushed me.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.784
This place is fabulous!

14:17.056 --> 14:19.889
This is the downstairs living room.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.854
There's two living rooms?

14:22.061 --> 14:26.657
Growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

14:26.899 --> 14:30.357
It would have been,
but my parents just moved here.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.901
You should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.807
Want to make out?

14:38.143 --> 14:42.079
Why don't I put the food
in the fridge...

14:42.348 --> 14:44.816
...and we can eat it later?

14:45.017 --> 14:47.008
That sounds like a plan.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.052
Is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

14:50.356 --> 14:54.816
Just down the hall
and second door to your left.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.998
-Hi, darling.
-What are you doing here?

15:01.200 --> 15:05.000
-We cut the trip short.
-France sucks!

15:06.338 --> 15:09.933
This may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.164
Say no more.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.709
We'll grab some food, go upstairs
and be out of your hair.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.708
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to ltaly?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.010
Yep. Sucks!

15:43.375 --> 15:44.933
Hi, you!

15:46.445 --> 15:48.436
Oh, my God!

15:48.647 --> 15:51.741
I know. I can do more than cook.

15:58.824 --> 16:01.486
I like her. She seems smart.

16:04.863 --> 16:07.229
Rachel, my parents.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.525
So nice to meet you.

16:12.304 --> 16:17.071
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

16:18.711 --> 16:23.546
What, this? Oh, no.
That's not what it is.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.046
Okay, I work in fashion.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.810
And this is a real dress, actually.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.922
They're wearing it in Milan.

16:33.125 --> 16:37.255
Part of my job is to wear the clothes
and see how people respond.

16:37.463 --> 16:41.092
Then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.159
Obviously, in this case...

16:45.471 --> 16:47.996
...I am going to report back:

16:48.240 --> 16:51.471
"U.S.A. not ready."

16:52.144 --> 16:53.236
Maybe in L.A.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.404
There you go!

16:55.614 --> 16:57.445
Have you kids eaten yet?

16:57.649 --> 17:02.382
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.250
Why don't we all
get something to eat?

17:08.594 --> 17:12.462
No use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

17:14.466 --> 17:16.024
So we'll go eat.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.929
You'll wear that.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.669
We'll be eating and,
of course, you'll be wearing that.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.337
I am sorry about what I said.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.605
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name!

17:30.449 --> 17:31.438
It's not bad.

17:31.650 --> 17:32.947
Yes, it is!

17:33.986 --> 17:36.887
From now on, I have no first name.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.052
You're just Bing?

17:42.995 --> 17:44.860
I have no name.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.825
So what are we supposed to call you?

17:48.467 --> 17:51.459
Okay, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

17:52.471 --> 17:53.802
...Clint.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.202
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint."

17:58.410 --> 18:00.674
What name am l
cool enough to pull off?

18:01.680 --> 18:02.669
Gene.

18:05.684 --> 18:06.673
It's Clint.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.386
It's Clint!

18:09.455 --> 18:10.581
Bye, Gene.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.320
It's Clint!

18:18.297 --> 18:20.128
What's up with Gene?

18:24.069 --> 18:26.367
You wore your nightie to dinner?

18:26.638 --> 18:30.369
The best part was when the waiter
spilled water down my back.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.442
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.615
It's all right.
I got nice boobs.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.478
I just picked up
a message from Emily.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.981
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.419
-So?
-So?

18:48.594 --> 18:50.323
Poetry?

18:50.629 --> 18:52.620
Susan's gay.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.126
They're being gay together!

18:56.235 --> 18:57.224
Emily's straight.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.404
Oh, wake up!

19:02.574 --> 19:04.940
Carol really messed you up.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.472
Excuse me?

19:06.745 --> 19:10.772
She turned you into
this untrusting, crazy, jealous...

19:10.983 --> 19:12.041
...sycophant!

19:15.721 --> 19:19.748
So I don't know what "sycophant" means,
but the rest is right.

19:20.492 --> 19:24.053
What are you talking about?
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.130
She's right.

19:29.401 --> 19:33.132
When we were together, you got upset
about Mark, and there was nothing.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.666
This makes sense.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.397
It does not!

19:36.675 --> 19:39.269
In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

19:39.478 --> 19:42.447
...even though all your girlfriends
cheated on you.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.247
So up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

19:47.452 --> 19:52.253
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam! Paranoid City!

19:52.591 --> 19:53.922
Absolutely!

19:54.159 --> 19:55.490
This is so fun!

19:56.094 --> 19:58.528
This is not fun!

19:59.798 --> 20:02.323
All we're trying to say is...

20:02.534 --> 20:07.028
...don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.464
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

20:15.847 --> 20:19.010
I still think I was right
about that Mark thing.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.716
Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.827
Drumroll.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.198
All right.

20:35.801 --> 20:36.790
Help!

20:37.236 --> 20:40.205
Am I a Mark or a John?

20:41.139 --> 20:43.733
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.876
But you might make a good Barney.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.011
Look, I am serious.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.547
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going
to the courthouse.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.343
You're going through with this?

20:54.553 --> 20:57.078
This name has held me back
my entire life.

20:57.322 --> 21:01.190
It's why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

21:01.426 --> 21:05.226
So tomorrow, I'll either be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.825
You've got problems because of you,
not your name!

21:12.004 --> 21:15.667
This has got to stop!
Chandler is a great name.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.341
In fact....

21:20.245 --> 21:24.113
I'm sorry, I know you wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

21:24.383 --> 21:27.875
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.

21:30.889 --> 21:31.878
Really?

21:32.090 --> 21:34.081
But you have to keep the name too.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.552
Okay, thanks!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.422
You want to hug it out?

21:42.134 --> 21:45.467
I'm going to go tell
Frank and Alice right now!

21:46.772 --> 21:47.761
Bye, Pheebs!

22:09.394 --> 22:11.658
-Nice luggage.
-I was going to say.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.367
I missed you too.

22:19.571 --> 22:23.063
-Thanks, I had a great time.
-So did l.

22:25.043 --> 22:26.032
No tongue.
