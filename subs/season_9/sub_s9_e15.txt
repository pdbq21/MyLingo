Guys! Guys! l've got great
news. Guess what.

00:05.243 --> 00:07.076
-Monica's pregnant!
-Really?

00:09.519 --> 00:11.614
Let's get past the moment.

00:11.990 --> 00:13.653
-What's your news?
-Thank you.

00:14.094 --> 00:16.087
l got a job in advertising.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.300
Honey, that's incredible!

00:19.506 --> 00:22.774
Gosh, what's the pay like?

00:24.281 --> 00:26.548
Oh, come on, people.

00:26.753 --> 00:28.950
lf l don't know who makes the most...

00:29.124 --> 00:32.460
...how do l know who
l like the most? Hi, Joey.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.971
lt pays nothing. lt's an internship.

00:36.172 --> 00:38.039
We have interns at <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.

00:38.276 --> 00:41.305
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.

00:43.319 --> 00:45.414
What do you think they'll
have you do there?

00:45.658 --> 00:48.789
lt's a training program, but they
hire the people they like.

00:48.997 --> 00:51.935
-That's great!
-There's gonna be some grunt work...

00:52.104 --> 00:55.737
...which will stink. A grown man
getting people coffee is humiliating.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.622
Humiliating and noble.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.092
Thank you.

01:05.764 --> 01:07.927
You know, if l didn't
already have a job...

01:08.102 --> 01:10.197
...l would've been good in advertising.

01:10.406 --> 01:13.105
Ross, you did not come up with:
''Got Milk?''

01:13.346 --> 01:15.282
Yes, l did! l did!

01:17.287 --> 01:19.986
l should've written it down.

02:10.460 --> 02:13.729
Where's Chandler? l want to wish
him good luck on his first day.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.404
And l smelled bacon.

02:17.073 --> 02:19.806
-He just left.
-Who did?

02:21.650 --> 02:24.120
Joey, you're never gonna
believe it! She called!

02:24.321 --> 02:25.881
-She did?
-You got it!

02:26.025 --> 02:27.688
-l did?
-What is she talking about?

02:27.928 --> 02:30.125
l don't know, but it sounds great!

02:30.300 --> 02:32.463
Your agent called.
You got that audition!

02:32.672 --> 02:34.004
-With Leonard Hayes?
-Yes!

02:34.174 --> 02:37.875
Oh, my God, that is great!
lt's for a play on Broadway.

02:38.049 --> 02:42.183
And in a real theater. Not that little
one underneath the deli like last time.

02:42.424 --> 02:44.018
-ls it a good play?
-lt must be.

02:44.194 --> 02:47.793
l read it and didn't
understand a single word!

02:48.002 --> 02:50.701
-Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
-Yeah, and directing.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.377
He was so good in
that movie of <i>Macbeth</i>.

02:53.580 --> 02:57.383
-You saw that?
-No, but l saw the previews.

02:57.555 --> 03:00.755
They played it right before <i>Jackass</i>.

03:01.462 --> 03:03.329
-He's done some amazing work.
-Oh, yeah.

03:03.499 --> 03:05.697
l loved him in those phone commercials.

03:05.871 --> 03:09.777
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone....

03:10.012 --> 03:11.879
Maybe the monkey
will be at the audition.

03:12.083 --> 03:15.853
Don't make me more nervous
than l already am!

03:24.809 --> 03:27.576
-Good morning.
-Can l get you a cup of coffee, sir?

03:27.748 --> 03:30.720
Oh, no, no. l'm an intern,
just like you guys.

03:30.888 --> 03:35.454
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that l can rent a car.

03:35.664 --> 03:37.462
Seriously, you're an intern?

03:37.668 --> 03:41.768
l'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.

03:41.943 --> 03:44.436
Dude.

03:44.849 --> 03:50.087
l know l'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like l'm Bob Hope.

03:52.998 --> 03:55.127
The comedian. USO.

03:56.773 --> 04:00.268
lt's U.S.A., sir.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.187
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.

04:09.364 --> 04:12.336
And as you probably already
know, this is Leonard Hayes.

04:16.478 --> 04:21.512
lt is so amazing to meet you.
l am such a big fan of your work.

04:21.723 --> 04:24.559
l've been blessed with
a lot of great roles.

04:24.996 --> 04:29.904
Tell me about it, huh?
''Unlimited nights and weekends!''

04:31.074 --> 04:34.376
Are you making fun of me?
Because l am not a sellout.

04:34.582 --> 04:37.246
l didn't do it for money.
l believe in those phones!

04:37.420 --> 04:41.794
l almost lost a cousin because
of bad wireless service.

04:42.030 --> 04:46.130
No, l wasn't making fun of you. l think
you were great in those commercials.

04:46.305 --> 04:47.638
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:47.808 --> 04:50.905
Well, l do bring a certain
credibility to the role.

04:52.050 --> 04:55.284
Are you kidding? When they shoot
you out of that cannon--

04:56.058 --> 04:58.791
''Hang up that phone!''

04:58.964 --> 05:02.130
-One take.
-Wow.

05:02.337 --> 05:05.332
-So shall we read?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

05:05.510 --> 05:09.575
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?

05:13.125 --> 05:15.756
What the hell are you still doing here?

05:18.335 --> 05:20.738
-l think you know.
-Bastard!

05:20.941 --> 05:24.436
l am what you made me.
You know what? l could go right now.

05:24.649 --> 05:27.313
-Go! Go!
-l can't.

05:27.487 --> 05:31.188
Oh, l want to, Long Pause...

05:33.365 --> 05:35.494
...but l can't.

05:36.371 --> 05:42.407
So sorry. You're not supposed
to say ''long pause.''

05:44.054 --> 05:48.495
Oh! Oh, l thought that was your
character's name. You know?

05:48.663 --> 05:52.158
l thought you were, like, an lndian
or something, you know, with the....

05:53.907 --> 05:58.041
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.

05:58.215 --> 06:00.048
You don't want me to do it again?

06:00.219 --> 06:01.848
-l could do an accent.
-No.

06:02.023 --> 06:07.091
You know, Southern.
''l could go right now, mon!'' Huh?

06:09.739 --> 06:12.039
My God in heaven.

06:12.578 --> 06:17.485
Joey, hang on. Leonard, can
we talk to you for a moment?

06:17.654 --> 06:23.860
Yes? You've got to be kidding.
He can't act.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.764
l don't care if you think he's hot.

06:25.937 --> 06:30.606
lf you want to sleep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a play.

06:30.881 --> 06:33.078
lf you insist on this...

06:33.252 --> 06:35.279
...l will call my agent so fast...

06:35.456 --> 06:39.294
...on a cell phone connection so clear,
he's gonna think l'm next door!

06:41.134 --> 06:45.701
Hi, thank you so much for
whispering for my benefit.

06:45.944 --> 06:50.351
Tell me what l did wrong. l'd love to
work on it and try it again for you.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.717
And also, how you doing?

06:56.198 --> 07:00.697
Give me another chance.
l really want to get better. Please?

07:02.243 --> 07:04.475
lf you want to come back today...

07:04.648 --> 07:06.378
-...here are my notes. Ready?
-Yeah.

07:06.586 --> 07:12.325
-You're in your head. Thinking too much.
-l really doubt that.

07:12.531 --> 07:16.231
No, no. lt's that you're not
connected with anything in your body.

07:16.471 --> 07:18.669
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggle.

07:18.843 --> 07:22.373
lt's a race.
Also, what you did was horizontal.

07:22.551 --> 07:25.488
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.

07:25.924 --> 07:30.923
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.

07:35.777 --> 07:37.804
Couldn't l just sleep with the producer?

07:49.505 --> 07:51.600
Hey, do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

07:51.776 --> 07:55.614
l can't. l've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.

07:55.784 --> 07:58.950
l know we've only gone out,
like, twice, but l don't know...

07:59.123 --> 08:04.065
-...l have a good feeling about her.
-Oh, l hear divorce bells.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.965
Give me your wallets,
and there won't be a problem.

08:07.139 --> 08:08.904
-What?
-l have a gun.

08:09.143 --> 08:12.309
Okay, relax, Phoebe.
Just stay calm.

08:14.287 --> 08:16.724
Oh, my God, l can't find my wallet!

08:18.696 --> 08:22.396
-All right, lady, now give me your purse.
-No.

08:22.604 --> 08:26.704
What do you mean ''no''? l knew you'd
be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

08:27.581 --> 08:30.416
-Lowell, is that you?
-Phoebe?

08:30.620 --> 08:35.288
-Oh, my God!
-Unbelievable! Oh, my God!

08:35.462 --> 08:39.927
l'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,
Lowell, from the streets!

08:40.105 --> 08:42.542
-Lowell, Ross.
-Ross, nice to meet you.

08:42.744 --> 08:44.873
Yeah, a real pleasure.

08:45.617 --> 08:49.283
lt's been so long! Oh, so long.

08:49.490 --> 08:52.952
-l can't believe you're still doing this.
-l know. But l quit smoking.

08:53.165 --> 08:54.930
Good for you.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.799
You look like you're doing well.

08:57.006 --> 08:59.603
l guess your mugging days
are behind you.

08:59.812 --> 09:03.148
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?

09:04.655 --> 09:07.593
Excuse me, Ross,
old friends catching up.

09:13.004 --> 09:16.465
-How'd the audition go?
-They want to see me again, but...

09:16.645 --> 09:19.377
...Leonard Hayes did not like me.

09:19.551 --> 09:23.217
-What happened?
-He said l wasn't urgent enough.

09:23.425 --> 09:29.233
Everything l did was horizontal,
and l should be more vertical.

09:29.505 --> 09:35.039
-He said that l should think less.
-Well, so far so good.

09:35.249 --> 09:37.378
Honey, l'm old!

09:38.923 --> 09:40.620
l didn't know you were
coming home for lunch.

09:40.793 --> 09:43.856
-Can l get you anything?
-Sure, a tube of Polident?

09:44.835 --> 09:46.828
Some Depends?

09:47.006 --> 09:49.408
Birthday wishes from Willard Scott.

09:50.112 --> 09:51.137
What's wrong?

09:51.347 --> 09:54.946
l am so much older than these other
interns. l can't compete with them.

09:55.623 --> 09:56.989
So you're a little older.

09:57.159 --> 10:00.029
Look at the positive.
You have all this life experience.

10:00.232 --> 10:05.801
Yes, but l don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.

10:06.010 --> 10:11.921
Wow! lt's like they're on fire!

10:16.364 --> 10:18.858
-What are they?
-Prototype sneakers.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.530
l need ideas on how to sell them.
Which l can't do...

10:21.709 --> 10:24.339
...because no self-respecting
adult would ever wear these.

10:24.548 --> 10:26.141
l'll give you $500 for them.

10:30.225 --> 10:33.254
-What am l supposed to do?
-Come on, sneakers are easy.

10:33.431 --> 10:37.132
-You wear them all the time.
-They're not called sneakers anymore.

10:37.306 --> 10:43.251
They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.''
l think l heard somebody say ''slorps.''

10:44.788 --> 10:48.558
They've got wheels that pop out from
the bottom so you can roll around...

10:48.729 --> 10:52.133
...because apparently
walking is too much exercise.

10:52.303 --> 10:56.711
''Kids! Kids! Roll your
way to childhood obesity!''

10:58.582 --> 11:01.816
Kids today have such
an easier time getting fat.

11:04.327 --> 11:06.525
Would you help me try to sell these?

11:07.266 --> 11:11.765
Okay. Have you considered
using a girl with huge knockers?

11:12.577 --> 11:14.443
That's not what they're looking for.

11:14.648 --> 11:17.175
Hey, that would work on me.

11:17.353 --> 11:19.414
Why do you think l buy
Mrs. Butterworth's?

11:30.145 --> 11:32.445
You'll never guess what just happened.

11:32.617 --> 11:35.281
-Phoebe and l got mugged!
-Are you okay?

11:35.489 --> 11:38.086
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.

11:38.963 --> 11:40.329
How do you know a mugger?

11:40.533 --> 11:44.803
l'm sorry, l have friends
outside the six of us.

11:44.975 --> 11:48.106
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.

11:48.314 --> 11:50.011
Seriously?

11:50.185 --> 11:53.716
Well, l'm not proud of it,
but, you know...

11:53.893 --> 11:59.131
...when l was living on the street and
l needed money for food and stuff....

11:59.336 --> 12:03.208
-That is awful.
-l wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

12:03.378 --> 12:07.443
l didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.

12:07.687 --> 12:11.787
l had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

12:12.029 --> 12:16.767
-Your mother killed herself.
-She was a drug dealer.

12:17.607 --> 12:22.572
lt was a good thing she knew him.
l was about to do some serious damage.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.184
Okay.

12:25.823 --> 12:28.818
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.

12:29.063 --> 12:31.830
-Why?
-Ross was mugged as a kid.

12:32.069 --> 12:35.303
-You were?
-Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

12:35.475 --> 12:37.639
lt was outside St. Mark's Comics.

12:37.814 --> 12:42.813
l was minding my business, seeing what
kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.

12:43.024 --> 12:45.085
Wonder Woman.

12:46.264 --> 12:48.359
Anyway, l was heading
towards this bakery...

12:48.536 --> 12:53.239
...to pick up a couple of dozen
linzer tortes for someone...

12:55.015 --> 12:58.476
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:

12:58.656 --> 13:00.956
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God.

13:01.127 --> 13:03.997
l know. And the worst part
was, they took my backpack...

13:04.166 --> 13:10.008
...which had all the original artwork l did
for my own comic book, <i>Science Boy</i>.

13:10.513 --> 13:13.382
Oh, yeah! What was
his super power again?

13:13.586 --> 13:16.489
A super-human thirst for knowledge.

13:18.696 --> 13:20.221
l better get to class.

13:20.398 --> 13:23.599
Are there any more of your
friends l should look out for?

13:23.839 --> 13:26.902
No. Actually, you might want to stay
away from Jane Street.

13:27.079 --> 13:30.814
That's where Stabby Joe works.

13:33.759 --> 13:36.595
-l think we have a problem here.
-What?

13:36.832 --> 13:41.934
Back in my mugging days,
l worked St. Mark's Comics.

13:42.109 --> 13:46.642
-Yeah?
-A pipe was my weapon of choice...

13:46.852 --> 13:49.983
...and preteen, comic-book nerds
were my meat.

13:51.795 --> 13:52.854
So?

13:53.064 --> 13:56.504
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:

13:56.738 --> 13:58.935
-''Geology rocks!''
-''Geology rocks!''

14:02.082 --> 14:05.988
-Oh, my God!
-l know! l mugged Ross!

14:11.067 --> 14:13.003
-You're late.
-l know. l'm sorry.

14:13.171 --> 14:14.902
But can l just run to the bathroom?

14:15.141 --> 14:19.138
-No. Leonard doesn't wait.
-But l am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

14:20.418 --> 14:23.015
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.

14:23.224 --> 14:25.593
-l really need--
-We must go now, quickly.

14:25.796 --> 14:28.859
-Yeah. Yes, sir.
-Ready?

14:29.738 --> 14:33.610
-What the hell are you still doing here?
-l think you know!

14:34.480 --> 14:38.386
-Oh, you sick bastard!
-l am what you made me! Know what?

14:38.555 --> 14:41.287
-What?
-l could go right now.

14:43.498 --> 14:49.340
-Then go. Go!
-Oh, l can't. l want to, but l can't!

14:52.015 --> 14:54.748
Cut. That was good!

14:54.921 --> 14:58.451
-Very good. You did everything l asked.
-l did?

14:58.629 --> 15:02.227
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,
l don't know, this squirmy quality...

15:02.737 --> 15:05.367
...you bring to the character
l couldn't have imagined.

15:05.609 --> 15:07.100
Here's what we're gonna do:

15:07.279 --> 15:09.807
Come back tomorrow
for the final callbacks.

15:09.984 --> 15:13.115
Do all of this, what you got
going now. But you know what?

15:13.291 --> 15:14.851
More. More. Can you do that?

15:15.028 --> 15:19.366
Sure. l don't have time to say
thank you because l really gotta go!

15:20.840 --> 15:24.803
Look at that! Still in character.
l like him.

15:24.981 --> 15:29.787
l plant seeds. l can't explain it.
l don't know.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.800
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Putting on the sneakers...

15:37.005 --> 15:39.670
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.

15:39.878 --> 15:42.577
-Oh, anything yet?
-Yes, how's this?

15:42.750 --> 15:47.818
''They're so uncomfortable, it's like
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''

16:01.453 --> 16:04.050
You're probably wondering
what l'm doing.

16:04.359 --> 16:05.851
No, that seems about right.

16:06.865 --> 16:11.671
Yesterday at my audition, l had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.870
l got a callback, so l'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...

16:15.014 --> 16:17.382
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

16:17.586 --> 16:22.118
-Joey, that was formula.
-We gotta get more of that.

16:24.099 --> 16:28.437
These aren't half bad. You should
suggest these to Ralph Lauren.

16:28.642 --> 16:33.778
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, l'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

16:34.186 --> 16:39.219
All right. l feel younger already.

16:40.966 --> 16:44.461
Yeah, l think l broke my hip.

16:45.843 --> 16:47.334
-Hey, you!
-Hey.

16:47.546 --> 16:50.073
Hey. How was class?

16:50.886 --> 16:53.015
No one asks me that. What's wrong?

16:54.192 --> 16:57.221
-Nothing. l really want to know.
-Oh.

16:57.399 --> 17:01.773
Well, there was actually a rather lively
discussion about the Pleistocene--

17:02.008 --> 17:04.502
All right, nothing is worth this.

17:05.716 --> 17:08.414
l have a confession to make.

17:08.588 --> 17:11.617
Okay, you know that girl that
mugged you when you were a kid?

17:11.995 --> 17:17.530
What are you talking about?
lt wasn't a girl. lt was this huge dude.

17:17.706 --> 17:21.908
He had a pitchfork and a sword.

17:23.184 --> 17:26.646
You don't have to lie anymore.
l know that it was a 1 4-year-old girl.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.383
-No, it wasn't.
-Yes, it was.

17:28.595 --> 17:32.763
You don't think l would have defended
myself against a 1 4-year-old--?

17:33.003 --> 17:36.704
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God, it was you!

17:38.247 --> 17:42.187
l can't believe it. You mugged me?

17:42.923 --> 17:46.418
Yeah. And l'm so, so sorry, Ross.
l'm sorry.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.364
But, you know, if you think
about it, it's kind of neat.

17:51.073 --> 17:55.207
l mean, well, it's just that l've
always felt kind of like an outsider.

17:55.381 --> 17:58.912
You know, the rest of you have
connections that go way back...

17:59.089 --> 18:03.724
...and, you know, now you
and l have a great one.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.667
lt's not the best!

18:07.673 --> 18:10.975
l know. Please forgive me.
l don't know what to say.

18:11.180 --> 18:14.915
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiliating thing ever.

18:15.121 --> 18:18.321
-Even more humiliating than--
-Let's not do this!

18:21.433 --> 18:25.168
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...

18:25.341 --> 18:27.812
...and start making
out with each other.

18:29.951 --> 18:32.387
That's interesting.

18:32.957 --> 18:36.452
Just one thought:
You didn't mention the shoes.

18:38.802 --> 18:41.603
Who's next? Chandler.

18:42.108 --> 18:44.602
You start with a guy
putting on the shoes.

18:44.747 --> 18:46.808
-He's about my age.
-Your age?

18:49.356 --> 18:52.385
He's rolling down the street
and he starts to lose control.

18:52.563 --> 18:55.125
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.

18:55.268 --> 18:59.003
Just then, a kid comes flying
by wearing the shoes.

18:59.175 --> 19:02.774
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:

19:02.950 --> 19:05.683
''Not suitable for adults.''

19:06.557 --> 19:10.520
-Well, Chandler, that's great.
-Thank you, sir.

19:10.699 --> 19:14.365
Or, man who's two
years younger than me.

19:14.974 --> 19:19.780
You see, that has a clear selling point.
lt appeals to our key demographic.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.945
-How did you come up with that?
-l don't know! l don't know!

19:23.123 --> 19:28.829
l was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to flow.

19:30.772 --> 19:33.710
-That is great. Good work.
-Thank you.

19:33.912 --> 19:36.577
We'll see all of you tomorrow.

19:45.936 --> 19:49.375
The cold weather hurts my hip.

19:53.484 --> 19:59.953
Hey, Ross. l know you're still mad at
me, but can l just talk to you for a sec?

20:00.164 --> 20:04.799
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.

20:05.007 --> 20:08.138
l just really wanted to apologize again.

20:08.313 --> 20:13.153
And also show you something
l think you'll find very exciting.

20:14.860 --> 20:18.800
Oh, my God! ''Crap from the street!''

20:22.943 --> 20:25.540
Look, Ross. ln this box...

20:25.715 --> 20:30.315
...are all the things l got from mugging
that l thought were too special to sell...

20:30.458 --> 20:32.428
...or smoke.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.960
Anyway, l was looking
through it, and l found...

20:37.639 --> 20:39.437
...<i>Science Boy.</i>

20:40.912 --> 20:44.214
Oh, my God!

20:45.922 --> 20:48.758
l never thought l'd see this again.

20:50.799 --> 20:52.290
lt's all here!

20:54.239 --> 20:57.006
What made you save
it all these years?

20:57.245 --> 20:59.682
l guess l just thought
it was really good.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.252
And maybe it would be
worth something one day.

21:03.090 --> 21:06.586
You really thought <i>Science Boy</i>
was worth saving?

21:06.797 --> 21:11.899
Yeah. But you should know l also have a
jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.

21:14.613 --> 21:17.608
Still, this is amazing!

21:17.786 --> 21:19.722
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

21:19.957 --> 21:24.364
You're welcome. Thank you for
Science Boy. l learned a lot from him.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.458
You're welcome.

21:30.010 --> 21:32.948
Wait a minute.
Did you add something to him?

21:33.116 --> 21:34.482
Oh, yeah.

21:34.653 --> 21:36.212
You see, the way you drew him...

21:36.389 --> 21:39.327
...there was no way
he was ever gonna get Gravity Girl.

21:40.364 --> 21:43.393
He looked like a Ken doll in those tights.

21:46.042 --> 21:48.069
What's that? What are you...?

21:49.650 --> 21:52.986
''ls that a beaker
or are you happy to see me?''

21:56.129 --> 21:58.726
l don't get it.

22:01.139 --> 22:04.670
-l need an answer!
-l can't tell you something l don't know.

22:04.847 --> 22:06.749
-You know!
-l don't know!

22:06.951 --> 22:12.862
-l need an answer now!
-You want an answer? The answer is....

22:20.712 --> 22:23.182
She never loved me.
She only loved you.

22:23.383 --> 22:26.082
You knew this all along
and you never told me?

22:26.289 --> 22:31.357
l can never forgive you, or myself. l have
nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

22:33.370 --> 22:35.603
Absolutely amazing.

22:37.879 --> 22:41.910
-The part is yours.
-Thanks! Now l really gotta go.

22:42.121 --> 22:46.061
No, wait! Congratulations!
You did it.

22:46.229 --> 22:49.395
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.

23:02.027 --> 23:04.122
Wow! That's a big cable bill.

23:05.835 --> 23:10.333
You don't have a job,
but you have no problem ordering porn.

23:10.979 --> 23:13.472
On a Saturday afternoon?

23:13.818 --> 23:16.186
l was in the house!

23:18.426 --> 23:21.627
Hey. Phoebe didn't by any
chance mention that--

23:21.834 --> 23:24.304
She was the huge guy that
mugged you? Yeah.

23:25.508 --> 23:28.001
l see. You didn't happen to tell--

23:28.213 --> 23:31.447
-Everybody we know? Yeah.
-Great. Thanks.
