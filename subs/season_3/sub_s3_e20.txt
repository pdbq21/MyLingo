WEBVTT

00:02.549 --> 00:04.779
You're telling me
this actress person...

00:04.951 --> 00:09.149
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

00:09.823 --> 00:11.586
Oh, my God.

00:11.758 --> 00:14.556
Is this what it's like to be you?

00:15.362 --> 00:18.388
- You're crazy about her, huh?
- You have no idea.

00:18.565 --> 00:22.501
When we're on-stage,
I get to kiss her and touch her.

00:22.769 --> 00:24.430
She goes home with the director...

00:24.604 --> 00:27.198
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

00:27.374 --> 00:30.969
It's so great to see you
feeling like this.

00:35.148 --> 00:37.139
Dad called this morning.

00:38.018 --> 00:41.010
Aunt Sylvia passed away.

00:41.621 --> 00:44.522
Yes! Yes!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:47.194 --> 00:50.061
We were all
pretty shaken up about it.

00:50.230 --> 00:51.595
Am I missing something?

00:51.765 --> 00:54.598
I always thought death was
supposed to be sad, in a way.

00:55.469 --> 00:57.699
Well, Aunt Sylvia was...

00:57.904 --> 00:59.565
...not a nice person.

00:59.740 --> 01:04.074
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

01:04.378 --> 01:08.610
And I'm sorry she died.
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

01:08.915 --> 01:12.043
- You get the dollhouse.
- I get the dollhouse!

01:13.987 --> 01:17.548
A house for dolls!
That is so cool.

01:17.924 --> 01:20.415
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

01:21.628 --> 01:24.188
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?

01:24.364 --> 01:26.832
No, just a barrel.

01:27.401 --> 01:29.494
You know what? You can play
with my dollhouse.

01:29.770 --> 01:32.170
- Really?
- Any time you want.

01:32.339 --> 01:35.433
When I was younger, all I wanted
was to play with this dollhouse.

01:35.609 --> 01:38.772
But no! It was to be looked at,
never played with.

01:38.945 --> 01:42.540
My grandmother used to say
that exact same thing to me.

01:44.718 --> 01:47.653
More of a bathtub-type situation.

01:47.821 --> 01:49.482
She did give you one chance.

01:49.656 --> 01:53.217
She told Monica she could play with
the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds.

01:53.527 --> 01:57.793
Yeah, well, look who's
losing weight now, Aunt Sylvia.

02:00.233 --> 02:01.359
The One With the Doll House

02:49.382 --> 02:52.681
Thanks for lunch.
You didn't have to walk me here.

02:52.853 --> 02:55.219
That's okay. No problem.

02:58.091 --> 03:02.755
You do realize we don't keep the
women's lingerie here in the office.

03:03.997 --> 03:06.124
Yes, I realize that.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.601
- Summer catalog.
- That's the stuff.

03:10.270 --> 03:13.205
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.

03:13.974 --> 03:15.874
You don't work for me.

03:16.042 --> 03:19.068
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

03:19.246 --> 03:20.941
Bing? That's a great name.

03:21.314 --> 03:25.182
Thanks. It's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done."

03:27.153 --> 03:31.146
- I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
- You too.

03:33.293 --> 03:35.989
So, what's wrong with him?

03:36.162 --> 03:40.326
Nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.

03:41.501 --> 03:45.904
No, no. I mean, is he married
or involved with anyone?

03:46.072 --> 03:50.202
He's not married
or involved with anyone.

03:51.511 --> 03:53.240
Well, Rachel...

03:53.413 --> 03:55.347
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.

03:56.016 --> 03:58.985
- I'll ask him for you, if you want.
- Would you?

03:59.152 --> 04:03.020
Or is it too sad and desperate,
something that Sophie would do?

04:03.189 --> 04:06.317
- I am here.
- I know that.

04:08.361 --> 04:10.386
Look at it!

04:11.698 --> 04:14.132
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

04:14.301 --> 04:15.768
Carpet's a little loose.

04:15.936 --> 04:17.426
Hardwood floors?!

04:23.877 --> 04:27.313
- It's so beautiful!
- I know!

04:28.348 --> 04:30.976
So I'm here, ready to play!

04:31.151 --> 04:35.349
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out.

04:39.225 --> 04:40.351
What's this?

04:40.527 --> 04:42.995
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

04:43.430 --> 04:46.524
Not one that can pee on the roof.

04:47.801 --> 04:53.205
Maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

04:54.741 --> 04:58.677
And is this in case
the house sneezes?

05:00.914 --> 05:03.542
No, that's the ghost for the attic.

05:04.517 --> 05:08.817
- I don't want a ghost.
- Well, nobody wants a ghost.

05:09.756 --> 05:11.155
But you've got one...

05:11.324 --> 05:16.193
...because the house is sitting on
an ancient Indian burial ground.

05:17.430 --> 05:20.695
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...

05:20.867 --> 05:24.098
...and an ancient
Indian burial ground?

05:24.270 --> 05:27.034
That would never happen.

05:27.340 --> 05:31.242
Obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. Government.

05:34.948 --> 05:38.008
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure. What's up?

05:38.485 --> 05:40.646
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

05:41.955 --> 05:43.616
I know.

05:45.291 --> 05:48.351
Well, if something comes up...

05:51.464 --> 05:55.525
I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

05:56.870 --> 05:59.703
My boss. Joanna. When you left...

05:59.873 --> 06:02.433
...she started asking questions
about you...

06:02.609 --> 06:04.440
Liked what she saw?

06:06.446 --> 06:08.710
Dug my action, did she?

06:08.882 --> 06:12.113
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

06:15.755 --> 06:17.313
That was...

06:17.490 --> 06:19.355
...surreal.

06:19.526 --> 06:21.858
What do you think?
Are you interested at all?

06:22.128 --> 06:26.497
Yeah. She seemed cool.
Attractive. I'll do it.

06:26.666 --> 06:30.261
Thank you. This is so great.
She's gonna love me.

06:30.804 --> 06:34.399
Dinosaur attack!
Quick, everybody into the house!

06:35.975 --> 06:39.570
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it. All right?

06:39.746 --> 06:43.113
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

06:43.283 --> 06:47.185
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian and they don't go.

06:49.856 --> 06:51.289
Fine.

06:52.258 --> 06:56.524
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

06:56.696 --> 07:01.258
While we're hovering around the subject,
I just have to say that dinosaurs...

07:01.434 --> 07:04.494
...they don't go, "ruff!"

07:05.839 --> 07:08.467
The little ones do.

07:15.682 --> 07:17.843
- Hey, Kate.
- Morning.

07:18.017 --> 07:20.485
I went to that restaurant
you were talking about...

07:20.653 --> 07:21.847
Hey, lovely.

07:22.021 --> 07:24.421
Come, talk to me for a minute.

07:25.024 --> 07:29.154
And I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish. Yeah, really good.

07:31.097 --> 07:33.930
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.534
- Joey Tribbiani.
- I know.

07:36.703 --> 07:38.568
I'm a big fan of yours.

07:38.738 --> 07:40.603
What?

07:41.508 --> 07:45.342
I used to schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

07:45.512 --> 07:47.173
...on Days of our Lives.

07:47.347 --> 07:50.180
- Get out of here. Really?
- Absolutely.

07:50.650 --> 07:53.551
But then they went and dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.019
They gave me the shaft, all right.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.351
You're so funny.

07:59.526 --> 08:01.892
What are you doing after rehearsal?

08:02.061 --> 08:05.861
- Want to get a drink or something?
- Well...

08:09.502 --> 08:12.300
Yeah. Sure.
A drink sounds great.

08:12.472 --> 08:15.999
- Cool. I'll see you then.
- All right.

08:19.078 --> 08:23.481
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.

08:28.988 --> 08:31.218
If you wanna make the
boys' bathroom realistic...

08:31.391 --> 08:35.122
...you're gonna have to put some teeny,
tiny porno magazines behind the toilet.

08:38.932 --> 08:41.196
Look everybody!
Look at my new dollhouse!

08:47.173 --> 08:48.765
Look, look!

08:51.878 --> 08:53.209
Hey, what's this?

08:53.379 --> 08:56.439
It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

08:58.751 --> 09:01.413
Very interesting, Phoebe.

09:02.288 --> 09:03.277
What's this?

09:03.456 --> 09:06.983
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

09:08.595 --> 09:12.964
When guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.434
This is the coolest house ever!

09:18.071 --> 09:20.562
Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

09:20.740 --> 09:22.799
- All right.
- I would.

09:23.109 --> 09:24.701
Hey, guys? Guys!

09:24.878 --> 09:27.278
Did you see my new china cabinet?

09:30.717 --> 09:32.548
Watch. Watch.

09:33.286 --> 09:35.379
And. And.

09:39.392 --> 09:42.190
Hey, my father's house does that.

09:43.730 --> 09:46.358
Okay. How did it go?
Tell me everything!

09:46.532 --> 09:47.897
The movie was great...

09:48.067 --> 09:52.629
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

09:52.805 --> 09:58.300
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!

09:58.678 --> 10:01.044
Chandler is fantastic!

10:01.748 --> 10:04.239
- What?
- We click! You know how people click?

10:04.417 --> 10:08.615
He came by to pick me up, I opened
the door and it was just like, "click!"

10:08.855 --> 10:10.379
Did he tell you?

10:10.556 --> 10:13.320
He's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?

10:13.493 --> 10:17.395
And he's so sweet. He said he'd
call, so put him straight through.

10:17.563 --> 10:20.862
- Isn't this great?
- Don't spoil it.

10:22.502 --> 10:26.768
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

10:29.909 --> 10:33.345
It's you.
Just one sec.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.915
I'm going to take this call.

10:37.083 --> 10:40.519
When I continue, I hope
that there will appear on-stage...

10:40.687 --> 10:45.147
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...

10:45.325 --> 10:48.351
...committing to the moment!

10:52.532 --> 10:55.126
The guy's like a cartoon.

10:55.635 --> 10:58.934
- What do you see in him, anyway?
- He happens to be brilliant.

10:59.439 --> 11:02.772
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.

11:04.143 --> 11:06.577
I'm not interested in her sweater.

11:06.746 --> 11:10.375
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

11:12.185 --> 11:16.144
And besides, since when do you care
who I'm going out with?

11:16.322 --> 11:19.291
I don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?

11:19.859 --> 11:22.987
Do you want me
to want you to care?

11:23.162 --> 11:24.925
Do you?

11:25.098 --> 11:26.292
What?

11:26.466 --> 11:31.494
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick it up where we left off.

11:38.177 --> 11:42.341
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

11:42.515 --> 11:45.143
I've got no reason to stay.

11:47.220 --> 11:52.317
Stop! Stop it!
You must stop!

11:54.260 --> 11:57.229
You are bad actors!

11:57.397 --> 11:59.888
This is a terrible play!

12:00.066 --> 12:02.432
I'll see you in the morning.

12:04.937 --> 12:08.270
I can't believe we go on
in a week.

12:08.441 --> 12:10.841
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

12:11.711 --> 12:16.114
So since we're getting off early,
do you want to go and paint mugs?

12:17.617 --> 12:19.209
What?

12:19.385 --> 12:22.980
At the place I told you about
last night?

12:23.389 --> 12:26.256
Yeah, with the mug-painting.

12:26.426 --> 12:28.986
I was so listening to that.

12:29.762 --> 12:33.630
But you know what?
I need to work on my stuff tonight.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.496
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:41.707 --> 12:43.299
Good night.

12:48.815 --> 12:51.978
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.354
What are we gonna do
about the scene?

12:56.522 --> 12:57.921
I don't know.

13:01.961 --> 13:04.828
Maybe if it had more heat.

13:04.997 --> 13:06.726
Well, how do you mean?

13:06.899 --> 13:11.131
Adrianne's looking
for a reason to stay, right?

13:11.304 --> 13:14.102
Victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta...

13:14.273 --> 13:16.639
He's gotta really give her a reason.

13:17.477 --> 13:19.638
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

13:25.551 --> 13:27.246
Or maybe...

13:27.420 --> 13:31.447
Maybe he could grab her,
and lift her up.

13:31.624 --> 13:35.685
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs
around his waist.

13:37.463 --> 13:38.760
She could do that.

13:38.931 --> 13:41.661
And claw at his back.

13:41.834 --> 13:46.931
Right. Then she could rip off his shirt
and kiss his chest and his stomach.

13:47.106 --> 13:51.133
Then he could use his teeth
to undo her dress...

13:51.310 --> 13:53.039
...and bite her!

13:53.212 --> 13:55.146
And then right when the scene ends...

13:55.314 --> 14:00.251
...he could take her
with this raw, animal...

14:04.524 --> 14:06.549
Something like that?

14:06.726 --> 14:10.059
Yeah. That's pretty much
what I had in mind.

14:30.583 --> 14:33.643
It's a little early to be drinking.

14:35.054 --> 14:38.546
Things finally happened with Kate.

14:38.724 --> 14:40.555
- You're kidding?
- That's great.

14:40.726 --> 14:42.318
It was so amazing.

14:42.495 --> 14:44.861
After the lovemaking...

14:45.031 --> 14:47.090
Oh, my!

14:47.800 --> 14:50.633
...I just watched her sleep for hours.

14:50.803 --> 14:52.737
Just breathing in...

14:52.905 --> 14:54.065
...and breathing out.

14:55.441 --> 14:59.377
And then I knew she was dreaming
because her eyes kept going like this:

15:05.785 --> 15:08.015
I'm telling you,
Joanna's got it all wrong.

15:08.187 --> 15:11.816
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again some time.

15:11.991 --> 15:14.050
I'll give you a call."

15:14.227 --> 15:18.027
I wonder why she thinks you're going
to call her?

15:18.631 --> 15:20.690
That's what you say
at the end of a date.

15:20.866 --> 15:23.699
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night"?

15:23.869 --> 15:26.633
To her face?

15:27.406 --> 15:29.874
I'm so happy.

15:30.876 --> 15:33.037
It's the end of the date.
I'm standing there...

15:33.212 --> 15:37.080
...all she's waiting for is for me to say
I'll call her, and it just comes out.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.651
I can't help it.
It's a compulsion.

15:40.820 --> 15:45.723
When a guy says he'll call,
it doesn't mean he's going to call.

15:45.925 --> 15:47.984
This never happened to you?

15:48.160 --> 15:50.185
Well, they always called.

15:50.997 --> 15:52.021
Bite me.

15:58.971 --> 16:01.371
- Did he call?
- No, sorry.

16:01.540 --> 16:04.873
Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

16:05.044 --> 16:09.140
Maybe he's intimidated by really
smart, strong, successful women.

16:09.315 --> 16:12.478
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

16:14.086 --> 16:16.577
Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why?

16:17.390 --> 16:22.123
Well, maybe he feels awkward
because you are my boss.

16:22.295 --> 16:24.786
Awkward?
Why should he feel awkward?

16:24.964 --> 16:28.559
The person that should feel awkward
is you. Did you tell him not to call me?

16:28.734 --> 16:31.430
If you're uncomfortable with him
dating someone you work for...

16:31.604 --> 16:34.072
...there are always ways to fix that.

16:37.476 --> 16:39.967
Call her. Call her now!

16:40.813 --> 16:43.611
Multiple so many paper cuts.

16:44.617 --> 16:47.484
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why? I don't understand!

16:47.653 --> 16:48.779
He said he'd call. Why?"

16:48.954 --> 16:52.048
I'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!

16:53.259 --> 16:55.750
Well, give me the phone then.

16:55.928 --> 16:58.761
This isn't funny. She thinks
it's my fault you haven't called.

16:58.931 --> 17:00.398
- You have to call her.
- Look...

17:00.566 --> 17:02.966
...you can't call somebody
after this long to say:

17:03.135 --> 17:06.127
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you."

17:06.305 --> 17:09.172
- Then you'll have to take her out again.
- No!

17:09.342 --> 17:11.401
She's really dull,
and she gets this...

17:11.577 --> 17:15.775
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye!

17:16.916 --> 17:20.181
I don't care! You're gonna have
to take her out again and end it.

17:20.353 --> 17:22.981
And end it in a way
that she knows it's actually ended.

17:23.155 --> 17:27.057
I don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!

17:27.226 --> 17:30.457
All right, fine! But it's just
a lunch date. No more than an hour.

17:30.629 --> 17:34.190
From now on, I get my own dates.
I don't want you setting me up again!

17:34.367 --> 17:36.335
That's fine!

17:36.602 --> 17:39.469
- That's just a lot of big talk.
- I know.

17:43.309 --> 17:45.300
I'm in the shower.

17:58.124 --> 18:00.922
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

18:35.094 --> 18:38.928
I talked to Lauren.
I told her how things were with us.

18:39.098 --> 18:41.862
Did you talk to Marshall?

18:42.034 --> 18:43.228
About what?

18:44.537 --> 18:46.903
About what happened with us.

18:48.007 --> 18:52.967
No, and there's really no reason
why he should find out.

18:53.145 --> 18:56.308
So let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

18:57.817 --> 18:59.785
What are you talking about?

18:59.952 --> 19:02.250
It was a big deal.

19:03.456 --> 19:06.687
You can't tell me last night
didn't mean something to you.

19:06.859 --> 19:10.317
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.

19:11.797 --> 19:14.789
I was just caught up in the moment.

19:15.501 --> 19:17.799
That's all it was.

19:18.404 --> 19:21.373
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but...

19:21.540 --> 19:25.271
...haven't you slept with a woman where
it meant more to her than it did to you?

19:25.444 --> 19:26.433
No.

19:28.514 --> 19:31.005
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Lauren.

19:32.218 --> 19:34.686
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi, pig!

19:39.525 --> 19:43.461
- Sorry I scared you in there.
- It's okay.

19:44.463 --> 19:45.760
By the way...

19:45.931 --> 19:49.094
...I was just checking
the shower massager.

19:53.405 --> 19:55.396
I tried to reach you at work.

19:55.574 --> 19:58.008
There's been a fire.

19:58.177 --> 20:01.305
What?
Oh, my God!

20:02.548 --> 20:04.277
What happened?

20:04.450 --> 20:07.351
We believe it originated here...

20:08.354 --> 20:10.515
...in the Aroma Room.

20:11.156 --> 20:13.522
Did everyone get out okay?

20:13.692 --> 20:16.855
The giraffe's okay,
and so is the pirate.

20:17.162 --> 20:18.789
- What is this?
- No, don't look!

20:18.964 --> 20:21.262
You don't want to see
what's under there!

20:23.903 --> 20:26.565
The foster puppets!

20:30.376 --> 20:35.177
It's not a big deal. It's right
here, and it's all the time.

20:37.316 --> 20:40.251
Well, thanks again for lunch.

20:43.055 --> 20:46.991
- Yes. This was pleasant.
- It was, wasn't it?

20:47.760 --> 20:51.161
- The food there was great.
- Wasn't it?

20:53.098 --> 20:55.225
So take care.

20:55.601 --> 20:57.762
You too.

20:58.237 --> 21:01.229
This was great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!

21:01.407 --> 21:03.637
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

21:03.809 --> 21:07.142
- Rachel, any messages?
- Sophie's desk.

21:10.849 --> 21:13.010
- Are you gonna call her?
- No.

21:14.453 --> 21:17.945
I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak
and pathetic and sorry.

21:18.123 --> 21:21.058
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.

21:21.226 --> 21:22.989
I'm not gonna call you.

21:25.431 --> 21:26.420
What?

21:31.971 --> 21:35.463
I'm sorry that I said I was going to
when I'm not.

21:35.641 --> 21:40.601
It's just that I was trying to be nice,
and you don't deserve that.

21:43.048 --> 21:46.609
- I see. I think.
- Look, this has nothing to do with you.

21:46.785 --> 21:49.117
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
It's me.

21:49.288 --> 21:52.485
I have serious problems
when it comes to women.

21:52.658 --> 21:57.391
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy...

21:58.330 --> 22:01.299
...mascara goop.

22:03.002 --> 22:07.132
I'm really sorry. It's just that
this isn't going to work out.

22:09.942 --> 22:14.003
Well, this isn't how
I was hoping this would end...

22:14.179 --> 22:17.478
...but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.

22:17.783 --> 22:20.047
Yeah. Okay.

22:21.186 --> 22:22.778
So...

22:25.491 --> 22:28.551
This is great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!

22:34.099 --> 22:36.727
So anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is...

22:36.902 --> 22:41.134
...I should have considered your
feelings before I went home with you.

22:41.306 --> 22:46.642
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side of it...

22:46.812 --> 22:48.905
...and I'm sorry.

22:49.448 --> 22:52.576
So do you think
you can forgive me?

22:53.285 --> 22:55.446
Great. Thanks.

22:55.621 --> 22:57.646
Okay. Bye.

23:05.564 --> 23:07.395
Hello, Jennifer?

23:07.566 --> 23:10.296
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.
Is Jennifer there?

23:10.469 --> 23:12.630
She's not home, huh?

23:13.005 --> 23:15.030
Well, actually,
I need to talk to you too.

23:18.711 --> 23:19.700
