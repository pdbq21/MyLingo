WEBVTT

00:14.214 --> 00:16.375
We're running low on resumes.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.347
You want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

00:19.552 --> 00:23.579
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones.

00:23.990 --> 00:28.654
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.

00:28.862 --> 00:33.993
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."

00:34.734 --> 00:38.397
-Paper cut! Paper cut!
-Here.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.738
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!

00:44.711 --> 00:47.874
Okay, we're almost done.
Only 20 more to go.

00:48.081 --> 00:52.677
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah. Why?

00:53.186 --> 00:57.885
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your "compuper" skills.

00:58.258 --> 01:03.195
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?

01:06.466 --> 01:10.129
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.839
The One With the Poker

02:09.329 --> 02:14.767
They call this a love seat but I'm not
feeling anything special towards you.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.507
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.106
Hi, ladies.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.773
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?

02:32.986 --> 02:37.286
-Lots of responses.
-Really? Sure, we have scones left!

02:37.891 --> 02:38.880
Read them.

02:39.092 --> 02:43.654
"Dear Miss Greene:
Thank you for your inquiry. However"

02:44.497 --> 02:50.265
-We have apple cinnamon
-"Dear Ms. Greene...." Yeah, yeah! No.

02:53.072 --> 02:55.438
-What?
-Your Visa bill is huge!

02:56.776 --> 02:57.936
Give me that.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.574
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?

03:01.781 --> 03:04.079
-I don't know.
-ls this about her...

03:04.284 --> 03:07.583
... "The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

03:07.787 --> 03:12.417
It's not just that. I want someone
who does something for me...

03:12.625 --> 03:14.616
...who gets my heart pounding.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.696
Who makes me....

03:19.332 --> 03:22.324
Little playthings with yarn?

03:23.403 --> 03:24.768
What?

03:24.971 --> 03:27.804
Could you want her more?

03:28.241 --> 03:29.230
Who?

03:29.442 --> 03:32.934
Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!!.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.150
Look, I'm totally over her.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.653
-Hi!
-Coffee?

03:44.857 --> 03:47.348
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.791
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.630
-What?
-Joey cried last night.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.306
-Thank you.
-We were playing poker

04:03.509 --> 04:07.775
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.439
You should have seen him.
"Read them and weep!"

04:11.651 --> 04:13.482
And then he did.

04:14.687 --> 04:18.487
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

04:18.691 --> 04:22.787
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

04:22.996 --> 04:27.160
-It's poker, so only guys can play?
-No. Women can play.

04:27.367 --> 04:32.134
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know

04:32.338 --> 04:34.329
All right, what is it?

04:35.842 --> 04:37.969
There are just no women
in our game.

04:38.177 --> 04:41.977
We just don't know any
women who know how to play poker.

04:42.181 --> 04:45.617
That is a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.786
Do you know how to play?

04:48.354 --> 04:50.219
No.

04:51.324 --> 04:54.350
-But you could teach us.
-No.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.660
Okay, so now we draw cards.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.968
So I wouldn't need any.
I have a straight.

05:09.175 --> 05:12.110
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

05:14.547 --> 05:18.381
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.

05:18.584 --> 05:22.179
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.689
-No, you can't
-I have the 10 of spades! Here.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.485
Thanks!

05:29.862 --> 05:34.492
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.396
Oh, you're

05:37.670 --> 05:42.004
You're going for fours.
Chandler, could you? Thanks, man.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.173
Here we go.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.475
We've got salmon roulettes
and crudites.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.515
What are you doing?

05:53.720 --> 05:57.554
In poker, there's no food
with more than one syllable.

05:57.757 --> 06:01.818
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz

06:03.096 --> 06:08.261
I hope you'll let it slide just
this once. I was all out of "pretz."

06:09.736 --> 06:10.998
Now the dealer

06:11.204 --> 06:14.935
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes. Big bucks!

06:15.141 --> 06:20.169
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two
jacks because they didn't look happy.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.785
But I'm ready. So just deal.

06:26.986 --> 06:30.012
Okay, last-minute lesson!
Joey....

06:30.223 --> 06:31.656
Three.

06:31.858 --> 06:32.847
Eight.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.623
Eight. Three.
All right, very good.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.531
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

06:42.735 --> 06:46.262
Joey had two fives showing,
so for you to raise was

06:46.472 --> 06:48.167
Yes?

06:48.374 --> 06:50.638
Downright gutsy.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.971
-I see, so you were lying.
-About what?

06:56.182 --> 06:59.345
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bluffing.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.584
And what is bluffing?

07:04.624 --> 07:07.821
Is it not another word for lying?

07:08.027 --> 07:13.226
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax resumes before work.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.901
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?

07:17.503 --> 07:20.165
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.969
See, King George is giving us
the land....

07:27.713 --> 07:31.877
-The game, Rachel. You owe us money.
-Right.

07:32.084 --> 07:35.747
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.583
Hell, no. We'll pay!

07:38.791 --> 07:42.158
Monica, I had another
answer all ready.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.124
And you know what?
We want a rematch.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.893
That's fine with me.
Could use some money.

07:51.471 --> 07:56.465
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.

07:56.909 --> 08:01.107
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.980
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.548
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.092
Look, this is poker.
I play to win.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.762
For me to win,
others have to lose.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.491
If you're gonna play,
don't expect me to be nice.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.636
Because once those cards are dealt....

08:33.813 --> 08:35.337
Yeah?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.180
I'm not a nice guy.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.188
All right, let's eat.

08:49.395 --> 08:53.229
Did you get that
from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?

08:53.666 --> 08:57.500
-You still on that?
-What was with that Black Bart speech?

08:57.703 --> 09:01.070
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy."

09:01.807 --> 09:03.240
You're way off.

09:03.442 --> 09:07.071
No, I don't think so,
because I think you love her!

09:07.813 --> 09:12.512
No. I might have had feelings
for her at one time. Not anymore.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.776
I just

09:13.986 --> 09:17.319
Marcel! Where are you going
with that disk?

09:17.523 --> 09:20.014
You are not putting that on again.

09:20.226 --> 09:24.185
If you press that button,
you are in very big trouble.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.655
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

09:57.863 --> 10:01.390
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get really competitive.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.302
What?

10:05.738 --> 10:08.969
"Hello, kettle? This is Monica.
You're black!"

10:09.175 --> 10:11.006
Please!

10:13.713 --> 10:15.874
I'm not as bad as Ross.

10:16.082 --> 10:19.540
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

10:20.052 --> 10:21.849
That wasn't an incident.

10:22.054 --> 10:26.491
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

10:30.396 --> 10:33.797
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.764
Saks Fifth Avenue.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.664
Oh, Rachel!

10:39.138 --> 10:42.596
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

10:46.078 --> 10:50.071
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.084
I would be shopping!

10:54.186 --> 10:56.654
For a living!

10:57.990 --> 11:01.949
That's Aunt lris. She's been
playing poker since she was 5.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.130
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.532
-ls Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.397
-He may be now. I hit him with my car.
-My God, really?

11:12.605 --> 11:16.063
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.

11:17.443 --> 11:22.938
Let me tell you something. Everything
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

11:23.149 --> 11:25.640
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

11:27.887 --> 11:32.654
-Girls, sit down.
-Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.760
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it. Okay?

11:37.630 --> 11:40.098
We'll start with five-card draw.

11:40.299 --> 11:46.238
Then we'll go into the studs and the
hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.897
Don't touch the cards
when somebody is dealing.

11:54.613 --> 11:55.705
How is Nathan?

11:55.915 --> 11:59.476
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.779
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.452
It should be so simple.

12:16.035 --> 12:19.471
Ross, could we please listen
to anything else?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.572
All right.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.683
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.632
Hi. Guys, guess what?

12:47.833 --> 12:52.668
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they're all recommending Trident?

12:58.677 --> 13:00.736
No, the interview!

13:01.180 --> 13:04.047
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.152
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.788
And I went to camp with her cousin.

13:10.990 --> 13:15.450
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-That's great!

13:15.661 --> 13:19.757
-Then she told a funny story.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.990
Let's play poker!

13:23.435 --> 13:27.929
Listen, we talked about it and
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.

13:28.140 --> 13:33.077
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.245
Very funny.

13:36.448 --> 13:40.475
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we should.

13:40.686 --> 13:46.386
-Do you want me to shuffle those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

13:55.234 --> 13:58.226
So Pheebs owes $7. 50.
Monica owes $10.00.

13:58.437 --> 14:01.429
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

14:02.274 --> 14:07.610
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed
Mary. We gotta play that other way.

14:08.447 --> 14:12.349
All right, here's my $7.50.
But this money is cursed.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.179
-What?
-I cursed it!

14:16.522 --> 14:19.389
Now bad things will happen
to the spender.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.560
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.997
This way, I can split them up
with a movie.

14:27.199 --> 14:32.501
So that just leaves the big Greene
poker machine, who owes 1 5.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.566
Could you be any smugger?

14:36.775 --> 14:40.370
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up
a new art gallery...

14:40.579 --> 14:45.607
...and I could sure use the portraits
of Lincoln and Hamilton.

14:47.119 --> 14:51.283
It's so typical.
"I'm a man! I have a penis!

14:51.490 --> 14:55.688
I have to win money
to exert my power over women!"

14:58.764 --> 15:00.288
This isn't over.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.693
We'll play you again.
We'll win. You'll lose.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.632
You'll beg. We'll laugh.

15:05.838 --> 15:11.071
We'll take every last dime you have.
And you'll hate yourselves forever!

15:13.245 --> 15:16.339
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

15:16.548 --> 15:19.949
I can't believe you lost!
How much did they take?

15:20.152 --> 15:22.052
Like 30 bucks.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.950
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?

15:25.157 --> 15:29.059
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!

15:31.797 --> 15:34.425
-Hand me the cards!
-Can l?

15:34.633 --> 15:36.430
Yes!

15:42.508 --> 15:48.504
Wanna give us your money now? We can
skip the formality of really playing.

15:48.714 --> 15:53.048
No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh, monkey boy.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.118
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?

15:59.325 --> 16:03.421
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.562
Right. Serious poker.

16:06.765 --> 16:11.464
-Mon, got any more of those salmon?
-You want to eat or play poker?

16:11.670 --> 16:14.833
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.838
Want to go to the bathroom
or play poker?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.670
Go to the bathroom.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.641
-Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!

16:24.850 --> 16:29.753
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.

16:29.955 --> 16:34.153
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

16:34.860 --> 16:39.194
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody, ante.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.387
Yes!

16:41.600 --> 16:43.534
Or no.

16:45.404 --> 16:50.501
-All right! Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fly's open, Geller.

16:56.415 --> 17:02.411
You know what I just realized?
Joker is poker with a "J"!

17:04.757 --> 17:06.224
Coincidence?

17:07.493 --> 17:11.395
That's jo-incidence with a "C"!

17:21.974 --> 17:25.205
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.

17:26.245 --> 17:28.873
-I'm in.
-Me too.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.946
Me too.
What do you got?

17:31.617 --> 17:36.350
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.885
Well, well, well!

17:41.160 --> 17:45.927
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes!

17:46.165 --> 17:50.192
I got four sixes! I won!
I actually won! Oh, my God!

17:50.402 --> 17:53.496
You know what?
I'll make a little Ross pile.

17:53.705 --> 17:54.865
Look!

17:55.074 --> 17:59.977
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.

18:01.380 --> 18:05.248
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

18:05.451 --> 18:07.715
And your fly's still open

18:07.953 --> 18:09.921
I made you look

18:12.791 --> 18:15.385
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be in-er.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.188
Monica, in or out?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.690
I hate this game!

18:28.540 --> 18:29.973
Joey, your bet.

18:30.175 --> 18:33.406
I fold like a hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

18:33.679 --> 18:36.648
... by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.380
I'm out.

18:42.921 --> 18:46.084
-Ross?
-I'm very in.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.989
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.992
Me too. Rachel?

18:52.397 --> 18:58.393
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?

18:59.338 --> 19:02.102
No, not this time.
What did you have?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.207
-I'm not telling.
-Show them.

19:04.409 --> 19:05.467
-No.
-Show them!

19:05.677 --> 19:09.773
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.044
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

19:15.320 --> 19:20.587
Your whole face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your temple!

19:20.792 --> 19:24.159
Plus, that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

19:27.966 --> 19:31.299
-I'm not losing.
-You're definitely losing.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.471
Hello. Rachel Greene.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.207
Excuse me. It's about the job!

19:38.810 --> 19:41.142
Barbara, hi! How are you?

19:45.951 --> 19:48.249
No, I understand.

19:49.755 --> 19:54.021
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly. Yeah.

19:54.226 --> 19:57.992
But if anything else
opens up, please

19:58.197 --> 19:59.824
Hello?

20:17.983 --> 20:19.177
Sorry, Rach.

20:19.685 --> 20:22.620
There's gonna be lots
of other stuff.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.345
Okay.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.190
Where were we?

20:28.026 --> 20:33.760
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.
Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.

20:34.633 --> 20:39.366
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.766
-All right. Check.
-Check.

20:44.142 --> 20:47.270
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-Call.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.276
I'm in.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.275
I see your 50 cents...

20:52.484 --> 20:55.976
...and I raise you $5.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.154
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.293
I just lost a job,
I'd like to raise it $5.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.962
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

21:05.530 --> 21:07.725
-Not at all.
-No.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.427
Loser?

21:21.313 --> 21:25.181
-No, I fold.
-What do you mean, you fold?

21:25.417 --> 21:29.820
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

21:30.055 --> 21:32.649
Were you just full of it?

21:45.771 --> 21:46.829
I'm in.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.834
-How many do you want?
-One.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.277
Dealer takes two.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.580
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

21:58.216 --> 22:01.117
Okay. I see your $2...

22:01.320 --> 22:04.050
...and I raise you...

22:05.324 --> 22:07.019
... 20.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.695
I see your $20...

22:14.766 --> 22:16.791
... raise you $25.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.370
I see your $25
and Monica, get my purse.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.711
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

22:35.787 --> 22:38.278
Okay, then get me your purse.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.196
-Here you go. Good luck!
-Thank you.

22:46.698 --> 22:50.259
I saw your $25 and I raise you...

22:50.802 --> 22:52.793
...seven.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.930
teen!

23:02.981 --> 23:05.506
Joey, I'm a little shy.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.047
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.961
-What do you need?
-1 5.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.096
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.390
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.131
I am calling your 1 7.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.168
What do you got?

23:37.749 --> 23:39.842
Full house.

23:46.224 --> 23:47.851
You got me.

23:58.503 --> 24:01.301
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!

24:01.506 --> 24:05.408
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.044
But look how happy she is.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.824
-Airmail.
-Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!

24:21.026 --> 24:24.257
Airport '77! Airport '79!

24:24.863 --> 24:26.455
Time's up!

24:26.665 --> 24:29.293
Bye Bye Birdie!

24:31.136 --> 24:33.229
That's a bird?

24:33.438 --> 24:35.770
That's a bird!

24:36.475 --> 24:38.943
Okay, it's my turn.

24:40.445 --> 24:41.878
Go!

24:44.082 --> 24:46.516
Bean! Bean!

24:47.953 --> 24:50.421
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!

24:53.692 --> 24:55.387
That you get?

24:55.594 --> 24:57.858
That you get?!
