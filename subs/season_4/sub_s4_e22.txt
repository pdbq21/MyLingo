WEBVTT

00:06.539 --> 00:09.099
That was the 10th time
I've peed here.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.376
It's also the 10th time
you've told us.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.671
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.

00:14.948 --> 00:19.885
It's easier having babies playing
"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!

00:22.055 --> 00:25.252
I am so sick of being pregnant. God!

00:25.425 --> 00:29.259
I can't sleep, except on my back,
which hurt. So I can't sleep.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.164
My only happiness
is from a cup of coffee...

00:33.366 --> 00:36.028
...which is decaf
because I'm pregnant!

00:38.204 --> 00:40.331
You want a cookie?

00:42.342 --> 00:44.810
Thank you so much!

00:46.212 --> 00:50.046
So, honey, how are those
mood swings coming?

00:51.117 --> 00:52.778
I haven't had any yet.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.081
The One with the
Worst Best Man Ever

01:42.869 --> 01:43.995
Hey, guys.

01:44.170 --> 01:47.264
All right, here's the ring.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.466
Yes, yes!
A thousand times, yes!

01:52.011 --> 01:54.377
Any ideas for the bachelor party?

01:55.915 --> 02:00.477
Before rings and bachelor parties, you have
to decide who your best man will be.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.280
Oh, it's awkward.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.653
I already asked Chandler.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.187
He got to do it
at your first wedding.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.560
I figured you'd understand.
I've known him longer.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.759
I don't have any brothers.
I'll never be a best man.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.733
You can be the best man
when I get married.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.738
I'll never get to be a best man!

02:25.145 --> 02:26.271
Wait, wait.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.438
So you'll be my best man twice,
and I won't be yours at all?

02:31.618 --> 02:35.076
Of course, you can be my best man.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.820
-What about me? You said I could.
-I'm not getting married!

02:43.096 --> 02:46.156
It's a question
for science-fiction writers.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.161
I can't believe it's not me.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.936
-How could it not be me?
-I'm not even

02:51.437 --> 02:53.337
You know what?
That's it.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.302
From now on,
Joey will be my best man.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.602
Shame about you, though.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.815
-Stop it.
-What?

03:07.287 --> 03:09.016
One of the babies is kicking.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.614
That's a good thing.

03:10.823 --> 03:14.259
It's not kicking me.
It's kicking another baby.

03:15.428 --> 03:18.363
Don't make me come in there!

03:20.633 --> 03:22.658
Do you have a big bowl
I can borrow?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.666
There's one under the cabinet.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.706
-Why do you need it?
-We're having a party tomorrow night.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.902
-Are you planning on inviting us?
-No. Later!

03:34.781 --> 03:37.181
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

03:40.987 --> 03:42.147
Hormones.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.847
How come you're having a party
and we're not invited?

03:47.126 --> 03:50.186
-It's Ross' bachelor party.
-So?

03:50.363 --> 03:51.455
Are you bachelors?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.461
Are you strippers?

03:57.937 --> 03:59.632
Then you're not invited.

03:59.806 --> 04:03.173
Then you're not invited
to our party either.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.934
What party?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.572
Phoebe's baby shower.

04:10.917 --> 04:16.048
Baby shower? That so doesn't sound
like something I want to do.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.322
I can't believe
I'm going to have a party.

04:21.527 --> 04:24.018
That's so great.
A party!

04:32.538 --> 04:34.233
I don't know why.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.574
This is what I got going
for the party liquor-wise.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.302
-Get a lot of liquor.
-Great.

04:41.581 --> 04:45.483
In terms of the invite list,
I got you, me and Chandler.

04:45.752 --> 04:49.051
I'll invite Gunther because
we're talking pretty loud.

04:49.322 --> 04:50.949
I'll be there.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.759
I know it's your party...

04:53.960 --> 04:57.327
...but I'd like to limit
the number of museum geeks.

04:57.563 --> 05:02.591
Let's not invite any anthropologists.
Just the dinosaur dudes.

05:05.505 --> 05:08.668
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.940
Hey, what are you doing?

05:12.145 --> 05:16.241
Just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.748
Good luck trying
to top the last one.

05:19.018 --> 05:22.784
It won't be that difficult
since this one won't be...

05:22.989 --> 05:25.082
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.925
I'm Ross, I'm Ross.
I'm too good for the Hut.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.995
I gotta go pick up Ben.
Everything sounds great.

05:35.201 --> 05:38.398
Keep it on the mellow side.
A few guys hanging out.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.539
-No strippers or anything.
-You got it.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.300
See you later.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.772
Have fun planning your mellow party.

05:48.948 --> 05:54.113
There will be strippers. He didn't
say anything about no strippers.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.980
He just said, "No strippers."

05:57.290 --> 05:58.780
I chose not to hear that.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.389
Look what I got, look what I got!

06:08.768 --> 06:10.736
They make these for little people!

06:11.304 --> 06:12.999
Little Village People.

06:16.809 --> 06:20.301
Look at this one.
This is my favorite.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.006
That is so sweet.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.307
Phoebe will love dressing them.

06:27.620 --> 06:31.818
Except she won't be the one
who gets to dress them.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.959
She won't get to keep the babies.

06:36.195 --> 06:40.359
My God, we are throwing
the most depressing baby shower!

06:42.268 --> 06:46.466
Unless we give her all gifts
she can use after her pregnancy.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.004
Like regular coffee. Tequila!

06:49.175 --> 06:51.837
-A carton of cigarettes!
-She doesn't smoke.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.378
-It's the thought that counts.
-It's a great idea.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.608
And those leather pants
she's always wanted!

06:58.785 --> 07:00.275
She'll love that!

07:00.553 --> 07:02.077
What the hell is this?

07:03.790 --> 07:05.985
You thought it'd make me feel better?

07:06.225 --> 07:09.717
To give me something
I can't use for two months?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.419
This sucks!

07:13.166 --> 07:16.658
-Who gave me this?
-Well, l

07:16.836 --> 07:19.031
They told me you like them.

07:20.573 --> 07:25.875
All right, then I'm wrong. It's a great gift.
The best present I ever got!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.871
What's my next present?

07:28.080 --> 07:30.241
We don't have anything.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.377
All right, fine, then this is over.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.285
Balloons!

07:41.060 --> 07:43.790
-Listen, about the stripper....
-Yeah?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.988
Good call!

07:47.233 --> 07:50.168
So I'll be hosting
your next bachelor party?

07:50.336 --> 07:53.794
Joey, I'm kind of hoping
this will be my last one.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.835
A little announcement.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.674
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.108
What's my last name?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.011
Central Perk?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.489
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.592
Hey, Gunther!
Don't forget your shirt.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.920
What are those?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.827
Little party favors.
Check it out.

08:29.542 --> 08:34.309
Just want everybody to know the
position of my best man is still open.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.677
So is the position of the bride.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.443
Great.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.142
Smooth, man.

08:42.321 --> 08:44.812
You got some chili on your neck.

08:47.994 --> 08:51.725
I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great!

08:51.998 --> 08:54.296
See you guys Monday morning.

08:57.003 --> 09:00.234
-Thanks, Joey.
-Don't forget your shirt.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.909
Hey, museum geeks!
Party's over.

09:07.179 --> 09:10.410
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.

09:10.683 --> 09:14.050
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.623
Boys, come on out.
Here you go.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.889
Look at the birdies!
Are those yours?

09:24.764 --> 09:28.325
They let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?

09:28.534 --> 09:31.196
And I got the duck
totally trained too.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.763
Stare at the wall.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.666
Hardly move.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.677
Be white.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.245
You are good at that.

09:44.216 --> 09:45.547
I had fun tonight.

09:45.718 --> 09:49.779
-You throw one hell of a party.
-Thanks. It was great meeting you.

09:50.022 --> 09:54.857
If any of my friends ever get married
or have a birthday or a Tuesday....

09:55.061 --> 09:57.291
Yeah, that'd be great.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.924
So, I guess, good night.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.636
Unless you want to hang around.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.807
I'll let you play with my duck.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.989
Stripper!

10:38.170 --> 10:40.832
The stripper stole the ring!

10:41.007 --> 10:44.738
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!

10:44.977 --> 10:47.537
-What?
-The ring is gone!

10:48.581 --> 10:51.846
Just give me a minute
to wake up for this.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.518
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man!

10:58.658 --> 11:02.958
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.188
I wake up, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!

11:06.465 --> 11:08.330
-You slept with her?
-Of course!

11:11.270 --> 11:14.205
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Phoebe.

11:15.641 --> 11:21.170
I wanted to apologize if I seemed
a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.173
Just the hormones.

11:24.483 --> 11:26.747
-No, we
-Hormones.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.012
I wanted to say thank you.
It was so sweet.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.626
You seem to be doing much better.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.026
-How are things going?
-Good.

11:41.267 --> 11:46.261
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?

11:46.505 --> 11:51.033
We were just talking about me
not going to Ross' wedding.

11:51.677 --> 11:56.046
It just might be too hard,
given the history and all that.

11:56.282 --> 12:00.218
This reminds me of the time
when I lived on the street.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.683
This guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.618
How is this like that?

12:08.861 --> 12:12.797
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.500
Because that was an actual problem.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.227
And yours is just a bunch
of high-school crap...

12:19.472 --> 12:22.134
...that nobody really gives!

12:27.413 --> 12:29.404
I'm sorry. I just thought

12:29.682 --> 12:32.150
Here come the water works.

12:34.353 --> 12:37.948
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

12:38.224 --> 12:42.354
I called 911 and they yelled at me.
This is an emergency!

12:42.962 --> 12:45.954
I really wanna help you out,
but I got plans to go see Titanic...

12:46.132 --> 12:50.068
...so I've got to call 911
to find out what time it starts.

12:51.337 --> 12:52.929
Hey, guys.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.603
Thanks again for last night.
What a great party.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.540
The guys from work had a blast.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.771
One of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

13:03.983 --> 13:07.077
Another one had never been
to a party before.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.254
So that wedding ring.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.656
-Man, that is nice.
-Yeah, right?

13:15.828 --> 13:18.626
I might pick one of those
babies up for myself.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.562
Where might one get one of those?

13:22.134 --> 13:25.729
When my grandmother first came
to this country...

13:25.971 --> 13:30.806
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

13:32.978 --> 13:37.142
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

13:37.883 --> 13:41.148
Absolutely. It's been in my family
for generations.

13:41.420 --> 13:45.151
Every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.451
So you might say it's a magic ring.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.565
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.993
What?

14:00.272 --> 14:02.763
-What did you just
-I think I heard what he said.

14:02.942 --> 14:08.107
I believe it was,
"The stripper stole the ring."

14:09.882 --> 14:12.043
My ring? My wedding ring?

14:12.284 --> 14:16.311
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

14:16.488 --> 14:18.581
How could this happen?

14:18.757 --> 14:22.887
It all started when you said,
"Joey, you be my best man!"

14:25.331 --> 14:27.993
All right.
I'm going to call the cops.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.566
I screwed up.
But you don't have to turn me in.

14:31.804 --> 14:35.740
-Not on you, on the stripper.
-I already did that.

14:36.008 --> 14:40.001
They said they'd look into it
after they solve all the murders.

14:40.279 --> 14:43.771
-We'll call the company that sent her.
-I did that too.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.745
They wouldn't give me her real name.

14:45.918 --> 14:48.113
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

14:48.287 --> 14:52.417
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring."

14:52.658 --> 14:54.455
So, what are you telling me?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.219
There's nothing we can do?

14:56.395 --> 15:01.264
-How could this happen?
-Look, Ross, I am so sorry.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.595
What if we just called her...

15:07.806 --> 15:10.798
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?

15:11.076 --> 15:14.512
That sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!

15:21.186 --> 15:23.279
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.318
It's so good.

15:32.364 --> 15:33.661
Thanks.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.767
-Good.
-So glad you like it.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.566
What? She made the tea.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.776
I think I just had a contraction.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.933
-What?
-My God!

15:46.178 --> 15:48.339
I felt one a few minutes ago.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.478
That definitely was one.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.344
You can't have the baby here.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.146
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!

15:55.321 --> 16:01.317
It's okay. I'll boil some water
and rip up some sheets.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.557
It's probably false labor.

16:04.763 --> 16:08.096
That can happen near the end.
Just get the book.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.132
-Get the book!
-The book!

16:13.072 --> 16:15.700
-The Bible?
-I don't know!

16:21.113 --> 16:22.944
All right. This is great.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.876
You get behind the desk.

16:25.084 --> 16:28.383
When she comes in,
she won't recognize you because

16:28.587 --> 16:30.418
Well, why would she?

16:31.256 --> 16:33.281
And then you buzz Ross and l.

16:33.525 --> 16:37.518
You be Mr. Gonzales,
and I'll be Mr. Wong.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.364
Diverse.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.831
Anybody call for security?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.033
You be cool.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.844
Which one is Gunther Central Perk?

16:58.684 --> 16:59.776
Joey.

16:59.985 --> 17:03.318
Where's my ring?
My dead grandmother's wedding ring.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.718
Way to be cool, man.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.518
What?

17:10.329 --> 17:14.561
There was a ring in a box.
After you left, it was gone.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.791
You think I stole some ring?

17:19.638 --> 17:22.732
We know you took it!
Just save yourself the time and confess.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.842
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

17:28.814 --> 17:33.183
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.
I make $1,600 a week.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.410
Any of you guys make that?

17:36.522 --> 17:38.183
Marry me.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.294
I don't get it. It was in my room all night.
She didn't take it.

17:45.531 --> 17:48.591
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it. Then who did?

17:51.170 --> 17:53.195
We're trying to think.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.720
I don't get how you know
it's false labor.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.445
Do you see any babies?

18:13.559 --> 18:16.858
-How do you feel?
-Okay, I guess.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.290
I don't know.

18:19.531 --> 18:22.728
I know it's going
to be over soon so....

18:23.001 --> 18:25.526
But isn't that a good thing?

18:25.804 --> 18:29.399
-You said you were sick of this.
-I know.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.405
Usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...

18:32.678 --> 18:34.908
...you get to do the mom thing.

18:36.381 --> 18:41.751
But I'll be sitting around in my
leather pants, drinking tequila.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.086
Some moms do that.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.354
That's even sadder.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.696
Look, I know what I got myself into.

18:54.366 --> 18:58.325
It's just that
now that they're in me...

18:59.104 --> 19:02.505
...it's like I know them and....

19:03.442 --> 19:07.208
It just won't be easy
when these babies have to go away.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.947
I know, sweetie.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.683
But it's not like
you won't have anything.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.252
You'll have nieces and nephews.
That's even better.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.250
-Yeah, okay.
-No, really.

19:19.424 --> 19:24.259
You won't be the one
worrying about saving for college.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.862
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.967
Or putting them on Ritalin
when they just won't calm down.

19:33.138 --> 19:38.041
You'll be the one they run away to.
The one they talk to about sex.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.437
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.746
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.609
I am pretty cool.

19:48.554 --> 19:52.957
And you know what else?
Are they going to love you!

19:53.959 --> 19:55.984
They are going to love me.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.627
Thanks, you guys. Again.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.056
Oh, sweetie.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.325
Thanks.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.493
What?

20:06.672 --> 20:07.696
Just kidding.

20:09.441 --> 20:10.499
Oh, my God!

20:10.809 --> 20:12.538
Got you again.
You're so easy!

20:16.782 --> 20:18.340
If anything happens to him

20:18.550 --> 20:21.519
The vet said
it's a simple procedure.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.780
Things can go wrong.
What if he doesn't make it?

20:25.057 --> 20:28.220
-He will, Joe.
-But what if he doesn't?

20:28.860 --> 20:31.294
He's such a good duck.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.664
I'm so worried about him!

21:12.871 --> 21:14.862
Somebody lose a ring?

21:15.207 --> 21:18.608
Oh, my God!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

21:22.180 --> 21:23.670
How's the duck?

21:23.882 --> 21:25.850
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.843
Great.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.284
-Thanks for being so cool.
-No, that's all right.

21:31.556 --> 21:36.118
You made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.454
-It's not your fault.
-Yeah, it is.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.459
You wouldn't have lost it.

21:40.732 --> 21:45.101
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.204
-No, you should.
-Don't argue.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.302
I get to choose my best man.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.908
I want both you guys.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.277
Really?

21:58.050 --> 22:00.985
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

22:01.286 --> 22:02.651
You two are my

22:04.756 --> 22:07.623
I'm lucky to have just one good

22:09.494 --> 22:11.325
Thanks, man.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.998
I got to go check something, okay?

22:20.605 --> 22:23.130
-What a baby!
-Total wuss.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.346
-How come you're getting Nana's ring?
-Mom gave it to me.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.978
She said something about it being
a wedding ring and that you may not need...

22:39.157 --> 22:40.715
...one.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.254
I really didn't need to tell you all that.

22:44.429 --> 22:47.557
I don't really think it's fair.
I mean, I've always loved that ring.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.360
Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.436
I'd let you have it,
but Emily's gotten really attached to it.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.197
Thanks.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.632
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

22:57.809 --> 23:01.905
Emily, did you know that that ring spent
two days in a duck's colon?
