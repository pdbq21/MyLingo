WEBVTT

00:02.902 --> 00:04.369
Pick a card.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.464
All right. Now, memorize it.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.900
-You got it?
-Oh, yes.

00:10.577 --> 00:11.805
Is that your card?

00:15.915 --> 00:17.348
Yes.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.652
-Hey, guys.
-Hi there!

00:23.757 --> 00:27.420
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.457
What are you talking about?

00:29.662 --> 00:31.254
It's not for sure, but...

00:31.498 --> 00:34.592
...we met this guy in the park
who thought Ben was cute.

00:34.834 --> 00:38.133
You know, which he is.
He gave us his card...

00:38.304 --> 00:41.705
...and told us to bring him
for this commercial he's auditioning.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.541
This guy's the biggest commercial
casting director in town!

00:47.247 --> 00:50.546
Ben takes one lousy walk
in the park and gets an audition?

00:53.553 --> 00:55.851
I mean, way to go, Ben!

00:58.058 --> 01:02.051
I've been in that park a million times
and no one's offered me an audition.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.822
It's crazy. We were pushing
Ben on the swings

01:05.031 --> 01:07.693
I'm always on the swings!

01:08.601 --> 01:10.262
What am I doing wrong?

01:11.104 --> 01:12.093
That.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.568
The One Where Rachel Smokes

02:01.921 --> 02:04.651
-Gotta go. Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

02:04.924 --> 02:08.121
Since you work at Ralph Lauren,
can you get me some shirts?

02:08.328 --> 02:13.425
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable
stealing on my very first day.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.598
Unwilling to steal from work.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.100
Interesting.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.971
If anybody gets free stuff,
it's me.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.506
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

02:24.377 --> 02:25.366
Go get 'em!

02:26.312 --> 02:28.473
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.945
I say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.482
But her birthday's
not for another month.

02:33.686 --> 02:36.951
If we throw her party on her birthday,
it's not a surprise.

02:38.725 --> 02:42.320
Great! We can have a dinner party
and just invite her close friends.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.690
Ross! We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.324
Done.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.202
Great. Wanna do it together?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.199
I'd love to do it together!

02:57.477 --> 02:59.468
They're gonna do it together.

03:00.079 --> 03:01.376
That's my girlfriend.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.242
So I gotta shut it down now?

03:05.718 --> 03:07.845
I gotta go.
I'm picking up Ben...

03:08.054 --> 03:10.420
...and then we're off
to the big audition.

03:10.723 --> 03:14.181
It's gonna be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.419
Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?

03:18.731 --> 03:21.063
Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?

03:21.334 --> 03:24.565
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and pretend to enjoy it.

03:24.771 --> 03:27.569
Maybe I'll go with you
and audition as the dad.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.208
Who better to play Ben's father
than his godfather?

03:30.510 --> 03:32.944
-You're not his godfather.
-What?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.713
Are you kidding?

03:37.750 --> 03:38.842
Of course I am.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.856
-Okay, let's go, godfather.
-All right!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.297
They're gonna let me audition!

03:53.466 --> 03:54.899
Really? That's great!

03:55.101 --> 03:58.662
One of the casting ladies
has actually seen me in a play.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.465
So I steered clear of her.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.631
And the other one, I know from....

04:02.809 --> 04:04.743
Well, you know.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.637
-That kid looks familiar.
-Oh, yeah.

04:08.848 --> 04:12.750
He's done tons of commercials.
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...

04:13.019 --> 04:14.748
...and that one
for the phone company.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.890
He was so good, he convinced me
to switch phone companies.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.854
Chandler was mad.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.991
He's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.426
I mean, look at him.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.396
That's great.

04:35.675 --> 04:38.508
Wouldn't it be great
if I got to play Ben's dad?

04:38.711 --> 04:40.110
You look nothing like Ben.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.946
I look more like him than you do.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.552
I really don't know you
well enough for you to do that.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.462
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one.

04:58.698 --> 05:01.292
I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?

05:01.534 --> 05:03.934
Well, that one is pretty...

05:04.137 --> 05:06.628
...but I just love this fabric.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.795
Sorry.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.875
Don't be. Part of your job
is to give your opinions.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.203
Then I take credit for them.
I'm kidding!

05:14.047 --> 05:17.312
She is kidding. But don't ever
disagree with her again.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.415
Okay, now I'm kidding!

05:19.652 --> 05:21.882
What a fun office.

05:23.122 --> 05:26.489
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.

05:26.726 --> 05:30.423
Let's take a break, go outside
and sort this out when we return.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.093
-You smoke?
-No.

05:36.302 --> 05:40.102
My dad's a doctor. And he would
always tell me horror stories....

05:43.976 --> 05:46.274
About ghosts and goblins...

05:47.680 --> 05:51.343
...who totally supported
the princess' right to smoke.

05:57.490 --> 06:01.517
And then they came back from smoking
and they'd made all of the decisions.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.285
-That's not fair.
-I know.

06:03.496 --> 06:07.159
It's like I'm being punished for not having
this disgusting, poisonous habit.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.162
Yeah, it is the best.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.362
What if this keeps happening?

06:12.638 --> 06:14.868
They'll be smoking,
making the decisions...

06:15.108 --> 06:19.442
...and I'll be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.113
And when Kim wants
to promote one of us...

06:22.315 --> 06:25.682
...who do you think she'll pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?

06:25.985 --> 06:27.885
We used to have
a smoking area at work.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.614
It was great. There was this
big flowerpot with dirt in it.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.985
We used to put our cigarettes out in it.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.151
One of the old-timers told me
there used to be a little tree in there.

06:37.930 --> 06:42.458
You can go down there and not smoke.
Say you want some fresh air.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.636
I could do that.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.239
Or you could do
the easy thing and smoke.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.277
You gotta take long, deep drags.

06:55.581 --> 06:59.039
Wow, I still don't have
my lung capacity back yet.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.047
Rach, do you wanna go get coffee?

07:02.321 --> 07:04.221
-I would love to.
-Oh, good.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.686
I'm gonna go too.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.018
Oh, good.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.992
Oh, I changed my mind.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.263
Let's talk about the party.
I have so many ideas.

07:17.537 --> 07:18.936
Me too!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.067
Oh, look at that.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.243
This is a little sketch
of the cake. See?

07:27.513 --> 07:29.071
Some sample menus.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.217
I thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.

07:32.518 --> 07:36.420
And for music, here's an
alphabetized list of all of my CDs.

07:36.689 --> 07:39.783
I've highlighted the ones
that'll go with the food.

07:40.326 --> 07:43.124
-What about the intimate dinner party?
-We're not doing that.

07:46.098 --> 07:49.761
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

07:50.369 --> 07:53.770
Wait a minute. There's plenty
of things for you to do.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.771
Like what?

07:56.809 --> 07:57.798
Cups.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.779
You're giving me cups?

08:01.647 --> 08:02.636
And ice.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.281
Cups and ice? I get to be
in charge of cups and ice?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.977
All right.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.715
Fine. I will be
in charge of cups and ice.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.220
-I can get ice at the restaurant
-I got it!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.491
-How did the audition go?
-Not so good.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.465
Wait a minute.
Are you doing Joey's:

08:26.739 --> 08:30.675
"The audition didn't go so well....
Yeah, it did"?

08:32.445 --> 08:33.434
Yeah, I am!

08:36.182 --> 08:38.776
-Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
-That's great!

08:39.018 --> 08:43.853
I had to teach Ross my bit because
I actually didn't get a callback.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.922
You got a callback too, didn't you?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.852
Yeah, I did!

08:56.936 --> 08:58.528
What are you doing out here?

08:58.838 --> 09:03.036
It got kind of lonely up there,
so I thought I would come out here...

09:03.309 --> 09:05.277
...and get some fresh air.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.809
We're discussing the fall collection.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.003
Oh, great.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.273
Anyway, we really

09:10.783 --> 09:13.684
-Sorry. We're smoking all over you.
-That's okay.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.513
We'll move. You stay there.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.449
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.057
That's great!
You are the best!

09:23.296 --> 09:25.389
Excuse me.
Can I bum one of those?

09:25.665 --> 09:26.996
Actually, this one's....

09:30.736 --> 09:32.363
What's so funny over here?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.603
I thought you didn't smoke.

09:34.807 --> 09:39.471
You know, I thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.641
You know what I mean?
Doobies?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.844
Actually, I thought to myself,
"Those guys are crazy!"

09:48.087 --> 09:50.578
But no, I smoke the
regular ones all the time.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.683
We get high.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.989
Me too.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.693
I'm kidding.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.395
Me too.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.665
Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?

10:08.941 --> 10:12.001
Fortunately, I don't get
many callbacks, so....

10:12.745 --> 10:15.407
Is it a good sign that
they asked us to wait?

10:15.715 --> 10:17.239
Who knows?

10:20.019 --> 10:24.183
We have narrowed it down
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...

10:24.423 --> 10:26.687
...and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.087
Yes! I knew it!

10:30.630 --> 10:32.097
Bye-bye.

10:33.065 --> 10:35.124
So long.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.098
Later.

10:37.269 --> 10:42.206
I'm not married to him anymore.
He's my ex-husband. I'm totally gay!

10:43.376 --> 10:45.742
This is great!
I might get to play Ben's dad.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.401
Actually, that can't happen.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.672
Because you have
such different looks...

10:49.915 --> 10:52.850
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.713
So it'll either be
you two or you two.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.689
-This is gonna be kind of weird.
-Yeah, it is.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.697
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.295
No. We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.303
I thought we were just talking.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.981
If Ben gets this commercial, do you
think you can get me some free soup?

11:27.787 --> 11:30.085
Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.

11:30.256 --> 11:34.317
Yeah, okay, but I have been supporting
a 29-year-old ltalian for five years.

11:36.896 --> 11:40.388
Is it okay if I leave this here
till Rachel's birthday party?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.533
-Sure. What's in them?
-Cups.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.735
Good, because we got Rachel
800 gallons of water.

11:49.508 --> 11:50.873
That's a lot of cups.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.409
I'm in charge of cups and ice.

11:53.579 --> 11:57.037
And Monica's gonna rue the day
she put me in charge of cups and ice.

11:58.851 --> 12:02.651
You know, I rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.915
Okay, time to bring up
the rest of the cups.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.566
Ross, I'm glad you're here.

12:14.767 --> 12:18.100
-I want to talk to you.
-What's up?

12:19.338 --> 12:22.933
I've been thinking about this
commercial thing. Me against Ben.

12:23.175 --> 12:27.544
The two of us competing.
That can't lead to anything good.

12:28.447 --> 12:33.578
I think I'm just gonna step aside.
I'll tell them that I won't audition.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.850
Joey, that's great.
Thanks, man.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.752
That's it?

12:46.699 --> 12:50.066
You're gonna let me do this?
It's my career we're talking about!

12:50.236 --> 12:51.225
But you just

12:51.403 --> 12:54.031
I just said that
so you wouldn't let Ben do it.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.474
If anyone should step aside,
it should be Ben.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.302
-What?
-Chandler, tell him!

13:02.314 --> 13:04.748
Well, let me get the door first.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.416
Hi, no one!

13:11.824 --> 13:13.587
Why should Ben step aside?

13:13.793 --> 13:17.229
It was his audition in the
first place. You tagged along.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.954
You're like the tagalong dad!

13:20.166 --> 13:21.827
At least I care about his feelings.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.390
What?

13:23.602 --> 13:26.435
You know how hard it'll be on him
when he doesn't get it?

13:26.839 --> 13:28.807
And why wouldn't he get it?

13:29.408 --> 13:30.807
Come on!

13:31.143 --> 13:33.839
Have you seen what my kid can do?

13:34.847 --> 13:37.475
He dials phones,
he eats tortilla chips.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.776
He plays soccer
with the cartoon tiger!

13:41.253 --> 13:44.950
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.853
You just give him a spoon, baby.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.459
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!

13:50.663 --> 13:52.654
This commercial belongs
to me and Mitch!

13:52.932 --> 13:56.368
-Your kid's name is Raymond!
-Yeah? So is yours!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.699
-How did work go?
-lt was great.

14:03.943 --> 14:07.037
I went down there like you said.
And we talked business.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.803
And Kim took my opinions.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.610
You stink!

14:12.518 --> 14:14.850
-Thanks.
-No, I'm serious.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.522
That's because I went down there
and they were smoking.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.181
This is actually the smell of success.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.051
But there's something different

14:23.362 --> 14:24.989
Oh, my God! You smoked!

14:26.465 --> 14:27.454
I did not.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.965
Yes, you did. You look
happy and sick. You smoked!

14:31.704 --> 14:35.140
All right, fine! But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.142
I wish I had to smoke for my career.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.076
But it's so gross!

14:41.313 --> 14:43.076
It's not that bad, you know?

14:43.382 --> 14:48.342
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
and my fingers sort of smell.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.021
I actually feel like I could throw up.

14:51.323 --> 14:54.087
-Can you hear yourself?
-I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.922
I'm not myself.
I smoked like half a pack.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.894
I feel a little shaky and a little weird.

15:00.065 --> 15:04.832
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.570
You smell so smoky,
I gotta get up.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.575
I'm not kidding.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.907
I think you smell great.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.214
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.047
Absolutely.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.350
I'm so onboard.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.963
-Didn't you just light that?
-Yeah.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.357
But you know what?

15:33.565 --> 15:37.126
I'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.028
Good luck, Rach.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.037
I've been thinking about quitting.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.809
Every Sunday night,
I tell myself I'm quitting.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.036
Every Monday morning, it's like:

15:48.347 --> 15:49.405
Tell me about it.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.378
We'll just quit.
Let's all quit!

15:52.785 --> 15:53.911
It sounds appealing.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.849
-I never could do it.
-But you could. Absolutely.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.024
We can help each other.
We could get those patches.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.591
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.287
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit!

16:06.565 --> 16:08.624
Great! Give me those cigs.
Come on!

16:08.867 --> 16:10.960
Give it! Out. Done. Quit.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.100
My late husband gave me that lighter.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.376
I'm not kidding.

16:20.079 --> 16:21.569
Okay, then.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.308
Mmm...soup.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.445
Mmm...soup.

16:34.059 --> 16:38.120
Would you mind watching Ben for me
while I use the ladies' room?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.490
-No problem.
-Thanks.

16:52.611 --> 16:56.342
So you want to be an actor?
I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

16:56.648 --> 16:59.947
There's tons of rejection.
No stability.

17:00.152 --> 17:03.849
I mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

17:04.323 --> 17:07.588
The next day, you're eating
ketchup out of the bottle.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.696
It's a tough life. I mean, sure,
you can get up whenever you want...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.957
...watch TV all day...

17:14.133 --> 17:17.500
...meet tons of women in acting class....

17:18.037 --> 17:21.996
Oh, who am I kidding. I can't
talk you out of this. It's a great life.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.908
-Joey.
-Ross.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.379
Ben.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.016
I mean, Ben. Ben.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.079
Raymond, Joey, you're up.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.357
So here's what....

17:44.530 --> 17:47.363
Are you sure that I haven't seen you
somewhere before?

17:47.533 --> 17:50.366
No, I haven't been in any plays.

17:51.136 --> 17:54.435
All right, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.200
Is there a problem?

17:58.410 --> 18:02.107
Well, this is noodle soup.
And I've been working with tomato.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.874
But that's okay. No problem.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.211
Mmm...noodle soup.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.786
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mmm...soup."

18:11.356 --> 18:13.881
-What'd I say?
-"Mmm...noodle soup."

18:16.295 --> 18:17.284
How's that different?

18:23.869 --> 18:26.269
All right. Let's try one.

18:29.808 --> 18:30.866
Mmm...

18:31.076 --> 18:33.044
...noodle soup.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.380
Let's do it again.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.718
Mmm...soup.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.891
I mean, noodle soup.
I mean, soup!

18:47.059 --> 18:48.048
Come on!

18:50.929 --> 18:53.056
You know what?
We need to move on.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.423
No, I could do it one more time.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.658
Look.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.130
Mmm...noodle soup.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.669
Damn it!

19:04.376 --> 19:08.073
So I think that if we get these samples
into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.772
Sounds good.
So, Rach, how you doing?

19:10.949 --> 19:13.577
-I'm great!
-No, with the not-smoking thing.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.518
Kill me now.

19:17.689 --> 19:21.284
Let me tell you something,
I ate 40 Mallomars today.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.987
I mean, I have patches
all over my body, you know?

19:25.164 --> 19:28.327
-I mean, I haven't slept in two days.
-We quit yesterday.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.996
That's counting today.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.505
But anyway, so these samples, I think

19:35.674 --> 19:37.107
Oh, my God!

19:37.276 --> 19:41.736
I'm so sorry, I forgot. I have to go
to the mailroom and mail some proofs.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.213
Go ahead. Rachel and I will just sit here
and keep brainstorming.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.977
Also, Vogue called.
And they were wondering

19:49.154 --> 19:52.988
You know what? I'm a little hungry. I'm just
gonna run down to the vending machines.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.589
All right.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.928
Busted!

20:06.905 --> 20:11.239
Come on! What are you doing?
I thought we were the Patch Sisters.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.068
That didn't work out.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.571
Wait a minute.
What about all we've talked about?

20:15.747 --> 20:19.114
You know, the disgusting place,
the ugly people.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.115
Hey, how you doing?

20:27.459 --> 20:29.654
We tried to quit.
But it was too hard.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.296
If you started smoking again,
you could have at least told me.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.056
Give me one.
What are we talking about?

20:36.301 --> 20:37.666
Don't you give up.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.837
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we won't drag you down.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.098
Wait. No, no.
Drag me down.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.106
Forget it. We're so proud
of how well you're doing.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.508
I won't let you blow it.
If I catch you, you're fired.

20:49.781 --> 20:53.512
Go on, get out of here.
I don't want you breathing this stuff.

20:53.785 --> 20:56.652
So, okay. You'll come with me
on the Paris trip?

20:56.855 --> 20:58.686
Oh, man!

21:03.362 --> 21:06.957
Check it out.
Cup hat, cup banner...

21:07.165 --> 21:10.999
...cup chandelier, and the thing
that started it all: the cup!

21:12.137 --> 21:13.365
Great job with the cups.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.467
Why don't you just go out with her?

21:19.544 --> 21:21.307
Did you notice the ice? Look!

21:21.513 --> 21:26.007
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.

21:28.654 --> 21:29.985
Mystical.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.359
No one's eating my food.
They're eating her snow cones!

21:38.630 --> 21:40.461
There are snow cones?

21:43.835 --> 21:45.200
-Go, go!
-Thank you.

21:50.909 --> 21:53.503
-You really did do a nice job.
-Thank you...

21:53.679 --> 21:55.579
...for stating the obvious.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.547
I deserve that.

21:58.717 --> 22:02.448
I just want you to know that if we ever
cohost a party together again...

22:02.621 --> 22:05.613
-...you can do whatever you want.
-Joey's got a birthday coming up.

22:05.791 --> 22:09.887
-Really? What do you wanna do?
-Okay, I'd like to be in charge of beer.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.530
Well, then there's nothing left for me.

22:14.399 --> 22:17.527
-Look, look!
-Surprise!

22:17.736 --> 22:21.399
What? My birthday is not
for another month.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.934
That's the surprise.

22:24.976 --> 22:29.072
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so great! It's so unexpected.

22:29.281 --> 22:32.546
I mean, Chandler's birthday
is even before mine.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.782
Surprise!

22:41.059 --> 22:44.620
This is so great!
Look at all these...

22:44.796 --> 22:45.785
...cups.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.932
This is so weird.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.298
I was in charge of cups.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.560
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.907
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.878
-What's in your hand?
-Money. I'm stealing all the money.

23:03.815 --> 23:05.715
Chandler.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.716
But just one, okay? Because nobody
knows when my birthday is.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.985
Let me make this clear to you, okay?

23:14.159 --> 23:15.751
It's either that...

23:15.927 --> 23:17.656
...or this.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.127
They were menthol.

23:33.578 --> 23:37.309
Listen, man. I'm sorry
the audition didn't go well.

23:37.883 --> 23:38.872
Yeah, right.

23:39.651 --> 23:42.347
No, really. I am, Joey.
I feel bad.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.682
Look, Ross.
You don't have to, okay?

23:46.324 --> 23:48.019
It's not your fault I suck.

23:48.226 --> 23:51.855
What kind of an actor can't even say,
"Mmm...noodle soup"?

23:56.535 --> 24:01.234
You know what? Maybe you didn't
mess up your audition because you suck.

24:01.540 --> 24:06.500
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.001
What do you mean?

24:08.513 --> 24:10.504
I think, subconsciously

24:10.715 --> 24:12.273
You lost me.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.557
I think, on some level,
you sabotaged...

24:20.859 --> 24:24.852
...your own audition
so Ben would get the part.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.031
Your way sounds
a lot better than mine.

24:32.904 --> 24:34.599
It's not that I'm a bad actor.

24:35.574 --> 24:39.567
No, it's just that I care
so damn much about little Ben...

24:39.778 --> 24:43.077
...that it was more important
for me to see him succeed.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.806
-There you go. Thank you.
-Thank you.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.914
-So did he get it?
-No.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.416
What are you gonna do?

24:54.693 --> 24:57.992
Is Rachel Green here?
I'm meeting her for lunch.

24:58.196 --> 25:01.165
She doesn't come down anymore.
You'll find her on 10.

25:01.366 --> 25:02.856
Okay, great.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.797
So we talked
about the presentation.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.699
He wondered if one person
would be enough.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.135
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

25:16.715 --> 25:18.080
I'll catch you guys later.
