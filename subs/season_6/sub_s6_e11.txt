WEBVTT

00:05.572 --> 00:06.834
Listen....

00:07.074 --> 00:09.167
You think I have a chance with Janine?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.142
We've been through this.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.778
Don't do this to yourself.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.412
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

00:15.616 --> 00:19.074
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited...

00:19.286 --> 00:20.878
that I just kissed her!

00:21.121 --> 00:23.282
-Are you serious?
-That's great!

00:23.891 --> 00:25.256
Yeah, well, we'll see.

00:27.427 --> 00:28.451
You kissed her?

00:28.929 --> 00:31.591
We kissed it up real nice.

00:32.199 --> 00:35.635
So you ended up with Janine.

00:35.802 --> 00:39.363
Well, congratulations,
you won fair and square.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.805
Yeah, it was real neck and neck
there for awhile.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.410
So you kissed. Then what happened?

00:45.979 --> 00:48.140
I came over here to tell you guys.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.207
So she's waiting over
there for you?

00:52.920 --> 00:53.978
Yeah.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.894
The One With The Apothecary Table

01:38.732 --> 01:40.859
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.630
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

01:45.839 --> 01:46.897
Okay.

01:49.376 --> 01:52.038
-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.371
But can you just...

01:53.614 --> 01:55.548
just leave your lips?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.779
Have you kissed her yet?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.249
It's awesome!

02:07.461 --> 02:08.928
I could do it forever.

02:09.196 --> 02:13.860
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.797
I'm so glad you said, "cooks."

02:17.738 --> 02:21.970
Look, it's like
imagine your best kiss ever.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.703
Right? Okay, now multiply that
by, like, 10.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.980
Wait a second, you dated Ross.

02:32.152 --> 02:36.384
And you date Chandler.
Okay, multiply it by, like, 50.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.185
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.529
We still get your bills and stuff.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.296
Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.601
I'm not your garbage man.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.563
I'm your mailman.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.531
Monica, look.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.538
Here is that table that I ordered.

02:58.845 --> 03:03.043
-You got it from Pottery Barn?
-Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.511
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.414
A pharmacist.

03:08.655 --> 03:09.644
"A pharmacist."

03:12.392 --> 03:14.257
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.061
I hate Pottery Barn too.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.389
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.362
You took off your pants and
got under the sheets.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.331
I was tired.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.337
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.444
She hates mass-produced stuff.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.546
She thinks her furniture should
have a story behind it.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.750
This has a story behind it.

03:38.018 --> 03:42.216
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.219
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.463
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

03:51.698 --> 03:54.531
Hey! I made that for her.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.536
-You made pottery?
-Yeah.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.798
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.705
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.108
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.873
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.215
I love these little drawers.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.322
Oh, look! It says that
it holds 300 CDs.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.583
Just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.890
Your what?

04:25.499 --> 04:26.864
-What?
-What?

04:27.067 --> 04:29.831
Enjoy the catalog, sweetheart.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.335
So the farmer says:

04:37.577 --> 04:40.478
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

04:42.516 --> 04:44.313
I'm so glad you're together.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.714
We wanted a couple to go out with,
and now we have one.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.851
We're a couple of couples.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.060
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

04:54.327 --> 04:57.990
And, Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.026
Thanks again, man.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.372
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.006
-That'd be great!
-Okay.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.609
But at least let us
bring the wine.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.244
-You don't have to.
-I insist.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.441
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.452
-Okay, good night.
-See you tomorrow.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.087
Can't wait.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.591
How are we going to get
out of that one?

05:37.537 --> 05:40.267
I can't handle two
nights in a row with them.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.465
What's wrong with them?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.438
They're just a little...

05:45.745 --> 05:46.973
blah!

05:48.315 --> 05:49.577
Blah?

05:50.383 --> 05:53.819
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...

05:54.120 --> 05:56.816
She's very loud for such
a small person.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.593
They're my best friends.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.323
Are you saying we can't go out?
Because that'd be a problem.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.326
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.570
Just not two nights in a row.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.568
-Okay?
-I guess.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.300
Thank you.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.778
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

06:34.094 --> 06:38.030
What a great table!
Where did you get it?

06:38.531 --> 06:39.964
Guess.

06:41.501 --> 06:42.798
A flea market?

06:43.436 --> 06:45.961
I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.999
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.840
You can just imagine
that this is where...

06:55.115 --> 06:57.709
they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.879
You can almost smell the opium.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.283
Almost.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.784
How much was it?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.550
Just only 500 bucks.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.490
Five hundred bucks at a flea market?

07:11.231 --> 07:14.166
I thought you meant how much was it...

07:14.467 --> 07:16.401
when it was new, back then.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.031
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.638
-A dollar?
-And 50?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.539
So it was like
one and 50 dollars.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.709
-They gave you the old-time pricing.
-Yeah.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.548
Well, what period is it from?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.353
It's from yore.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.717
Like the "days of yore," you know?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.153
Yes, I do.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.557
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.890
I bet it has a great story too.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.228
Did they tell you
where it's from or...?

07:50.503 --> 07:53.995
Yes, that I know.
This is from White Plains.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.905
White Plains.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.044
It sounds like such a magical place.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.110
-I'm here.
-Hi!

08:08.521 --> 08:09.681
Oh, my God!

08:09.956 --> 08:11.617
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!

08:11.925 --> 08:14.519
It's my new apothecary table!

08:15.362 --> 08:17.922
Phoebe will be here any second.
She can't see this.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.894
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.795
I got it at Pottery Barn.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.894
I know. I bought the same one.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.802
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.704
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?

08:31.911 --> 08:33.902
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.447
She hates Pottery Barn?

08:38.284 --> 08:40.309
She says it's all mass-produced...

08:40.587 --> 08:44.455
nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.319
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.725
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.232
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.732
I forgot they made sheets!

09:04.677 --> 09:07.646
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.505
It's not like she hates you.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.774
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.120
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.751
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

09:21.828 --> 09:25.423
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.201
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!

09:35.008 --> 09:37.704
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

09:38.978 --> 09:41.538
-Hey, cool sheet!
-You like it?

09:41.781 --> 09:44.545
-You want to know where I got it?
-Sure.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.149
At a flea market.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.052
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

09:51.124 --> 09:54.321
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.398
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.295
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.732
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

10:07.006 --> 10:10.373
but you couldn't, because
you paid for dinner last night.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.405
Thanks. But it's just
gonna be me tonight.

10:14.714 --> 10:18.514
-What happened to Janine?
-She's really sick.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.885
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.717
High fever, nose problem.
It's...

10:25.925 --> 10:28.257
phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.731
Monica! Chandler!

10:34.834 --> 10:38.326
I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
know if Joey told you...

10:38.571 --> 10:41.597
but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.678
Have a great time, huh?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.610
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.410
Oh, no, she really is sick.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.553
Then why is she going to a play?

10:57.790 --> 11:00.122
Well, you know, "Starve a fever...

11:00.393 --> 11:02.224
go to a play for a cold."

11:03.897 --> 11:07.230
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

11:07.467 --> 11:11.563
She didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

11:11.804 --> 11:12.930
I'm so sorry.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.068
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

11:17.710 --> 11:21.373
Because she thinks that
you are blah.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.210
And that you, Monica,
are too loud.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.977
What?!

11:29.422 --> 11:31.617
What?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.984
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.127
She was lying to our faces?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.626
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?

11:38.898 --> 11:43.267
-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
-And I am not blah. I am a hoot!

11:44.771 --> 11:47.137
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.001
I'm sure she said it...

11:49.242 --> 11:52.575
because she was nervous because
you're my best friends.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.770
And it was our first date.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.847
Plus, she's really sick.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.921
You said you made that up!

12:02.121 --> 12:05.022
But isn't the sick thing
better than the play thing?

12:06.192 --> 12:10.185
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

12:11.831 --> 12:14.994
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.669
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.532
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
-Okay.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.602
I do not like that woman!

12:28.114 --> 12:30.105
I can hear you!

12:31.484 --> 12:33.349
I am loud!

12:44.063 --> 12:47.226
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new..?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.327
Old sheet.

12:49.869 --> 12:50.893
Oh, sure.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.398
My apothecary table!

12:55.141 --> 12:57.200
-What?
-No!

12:58.077 --> 13:01.205
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?

13:03.883 --> 13:05.680
Oh, my God!

13:06.085 --> 13:10.249
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

13:12.358 --> 13:14.849
If they've ripped off our table...

13:15.094 --> 13:18.894
ours must be worth much more
than one and 50 dollars.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.499
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.602
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.772
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

13:28.241 --> 13:32.075
Ross, calm down. I'll give
you the 80 cents.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.941
Okay, one more time.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.015
Would you like some orange juice?

13:41.254 --> 13:44.690
-Perfect decibel.
-I know!

13:48.261 --> 13:50.092
What are you guys doing?

13:50.363 --> 13:53.924
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.759
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.632
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.535
-What do you say?
-I'd like to...

14:03.743 --> 14:05.802
but I'm not sure if
we have the time.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.614
Very funny. I don't know
what to do.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.784
I really want you to get along.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.713
Please come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.612
-We owe you?
-That's right.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.792
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.152
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.190
I looked like an idiot.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.887
And I was humiliated.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.792
And I only made $200.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.300
We didn't give you any money.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.337
You don't think I know that?

14:41.781 --> 14:44.909
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

14:45.184 --> 14:46.310
the Sahara desk...

14:46.586 --> 14:48.611
or the Parker console table.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.312
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.954
-I know, I went a little crazy.
-A little?

14:55.161 --> 14:57.994
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.729
Look at that!

15:00.933 --> 15:05.029
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.866
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

15:11.144 --> 15:15.376
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.009
Fascinating.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.617
Another amazing find!

15:24.390 --> 15:27.291
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.

15:27.527 --> 15:32.123
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.160
A lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.237
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

15:42.975 --> 15:44.306
Well, there's yore.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.674
And, you know, yesteryear.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.312
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.921
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

15:58.191 --> 16:00.352
and I think you should...

16:00.593 --> 16:02.390
you should ask Rachel to help.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.289
He doesn't need my help.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.830
I think he's ready to get rid
of the.. What'd you call it?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.830
The "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

16:14.874 --> 16:16.603
Really?

16:17.777 --> 16:21.770
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need..

16:22.081 --> 16:24.072
Here's 60 bucks.

16:24.283 --> 16:28.447
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial flea market...

16:28.721 --> 16:30.450
and get me some stuff.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.055
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.958
-I do want to.
-She does want to.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.563
-She does want to.
-Yeah!

16:40.733 --> 16:43.201
-I'm gonna get my purse.
-Okay.

16:43.836 --> 16:48.296
Hey, can I have all this stuff
when she makes you throw it out?

16:48.474 --> 16:52.604
Well, sure, and I'll show you
right where you can put it.

16:58.317 --> 17:01.844
I guess the flea market was
just better last time.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.181
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.758
Look at this. Pottery Barn.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.759
You know what? Don't look at it.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.365
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!

17:15.635 --> 17:17.603
There's the table
they stole from us.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.861
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

17:21.507 --> 17:26.035
That fan kind of looks like ours
and the birdcage and...

17:26.512 --> 17:29.310
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

17:29.515 --> 17:31.676
No, it's not.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.283
Come on, ours is totally different.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.149
I mean, we don't have the..
We don't have that lamp.

17:39.025 --> 17:43.325
And that screen is on
the other side.

17:44.363 --> 17:47.526
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.234
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!

17:50.836 --> 17:53.361
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

17:53.573 --> 17:57.634
I wanted this stuff, and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.710
-Come on, don't be mad.
-No, but I am mad.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.246
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

18:04.483 --> 18:06.474
and it's in my living room...

18:06.752 --> 18:10.415
and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

18:11.924 --> 18:13.755
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.221
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.657
I can't! I can't!

18:21.167 --> 18:22.725
Unless...

18:22.935 --> 18:26.598
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

18:26.906 --> 18:28.874
No, I'm not gonna move out!

18:29.075 --> 18:33.171
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

18:34.113 --> 18:38.015
-Yes! I would so move out.
-Then I don't have a choice.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.879
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.081
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.428
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.394
I did. I really did,
and I've got to say...

18:56.636 --> 19:00.003
I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.106
I guess I was just nervous.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.936
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.406
So we can go out again?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.877
-Absolutely.
-Well, good.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.819
See?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.147
Wasn't that fun?

19:18.424 --> 19:20.289
We have got to move.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.558
What?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.055
I knew it!

19:25.965 --> 19:28.297
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

19:30.236 --> 19:33.228
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

19:33.472 --> 19:34.734
is you talking about it.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.432
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost
myself in the movement."

19:41.847 --> 19:44.077
You know, I know you're talking...

19:44.283 --> 19:47.013
but all I hear is,
"Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah."

19:47.253 --> 19:50.416
All right, you and me!
Let's go right now!

19:50.690 --> 19:51.918
All right, enough!

19:52.925 --> 19:56.190
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.656
I really think you could take her.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.296
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

20:07.106 --> 20:08.130
All right.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.638
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.107
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

20:14.313 --> 20:18.374
-They said stuff to me too.
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.809
They mean so much to me.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.351
They're like my family, you know?

20:23.622 --> 20:26.785
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time....

20:28.127 --> 20:31.824
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.362
It can't.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.497
I'm very upset.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.402
Okay.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.832
Would it help if I apologized?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.704
Yeah.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.704
That'd be very helpful.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.343
What did I tell you about the hall?

20:54.553 --> 20:57.386
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.653
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

21:04.363 --> 21:08.663
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

21:08.901 --> 21:11.028
I would like that too.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.872
-Great.
-Now, come on.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.008
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Me too.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.077
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

21:22.348 --> 21:25.374
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!

21:27.419 --> 21:29.216
Wait!

21:32.758 --> 21:34.282
You'd better run!

21:35.861 --> 21:37.089
Did you hear that?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.558
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.395
-Want to go watch?
-Yeah!

21:53.412 --> 21:56.438
You know, I'm not sure
you could have taken Janine.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.645
I could have taken her.

21:58.818 --> 22:02.379
-She's much bigger than you.
-Are you kidding me?

22:02.555 --> 22:07.219
I know what to do with tall girls.
You go for their knees.

22:10.296 --> 22:13.163
-How you doing?
-So did she move out?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.126
Pretty much.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.562
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.896
When it's not right, you know it.

22:20.239 --> 22:23.333
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.706
-You know what would cheer you up?
-What?

22:28.314 --> 22:32.546
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.982
I think you should come.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.021
You're right, that did cheer me up.
