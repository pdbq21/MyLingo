00:01.435 --> 00:02.904
She's crawling! Emma's crawling!

00:03.072 --> 00:05.635
He's bleeding! Joey's bleeding!

00:05.811 --> 00:09.181
l'm sorry. You've gotta see this.
l'm gonna go get Monica and Chandler.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.114
Monica! Chandler!

00:12.592 --> 00:15.256
Come over! Come over!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:16.800 --> 00:18.531
What? What?

00:19.939 --> 00:22.570
-Shaving?
-No, rabies.

00:24.516 --> 00:26.918
-What's going on?
-lt's Emma. She's crawling.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.426
Wow, look at her go.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.091
Give her a second.

00:42.852 --> 00:46.450
l can't believe how fast she's growing up.
lt seems like only yesterday she was...

00:46.626 --> 00:48.356
...farting on my lap.

00:48.530 --> 00:51.502
Not so funny when someone
does that to you, is it?

00:51.670 --> 00:55.439
Emma, come on. Show everybody
how you were crawling.

01:00.053 --> 01:04.016
l think we're distracting her.
Let's everybody be still for a minute.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.058
Who's painting us?

02:00.774 --> 02:03.267
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?

02:03.446 --> 02:07.216
l know. God, l haven't seen
my savings take a hit like this...

02:07.387 --> 02:11.954
...since l was a kid and they came up
with Double Stuf Oreos.

02:12.130 --> 02:16.002
-What happened to all of our money?
-l'm not sure exactly what they did...

02:16.171 --> 02:18.802
...but l'm inclined to blame Enron.

02:20.213 --> 02:24.381
With you doing the internship, we're
spending more than we're bringing in.

02:25.423 --> 02:29.158
Yeah, maybe l should quit
and get a job that pays.

02:29.364 --> 02:31.927
But you're finally doing something
that you love.

02:32.137 --> 02:34.540
l mean, l can't ask you to give that up.

02:34.709 --> 02:39.879
Although it would be nice if the thing
that you loved was finding gold.

02:40.053 --> 02:42.786
You know, l think we're making
too big a deal out of this.

02:42.958 --> 02:46.898
We'll pay our bills late this month. Next
month we'll cut back on a few things.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.303
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

02:51.475 --> 02:55.610
You're a chef. What can you make
out of baking soda and beer?

02:55.818 --> 02:58.790
Worst-case scenario is, we borrow
some money from my parents.

02:59.892 --> 03:04.196
Or, you slipped on ice at their house
last month. Can we sue them?

03:05.804 --> 03:08.001
No, and we're not borrowing money.

03:08.175 --> 03:11.147
-Why not?
-We don't do that. We are Bings.

03:13.252 --> 03:15.849
lf there's one thing my father
taught me, it was...

03:16.024 --> 03:20.830
...well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.

03:21.034 --> 03:25.738
-The other thing is, never borrow money.
-l had no idea you had this much pride.

03:25.911 --> 03:29.749
That's right, l do. l am your man.
l'm gonna get us through this situation...

03:29.919 --> 03:33.483
...even if it means you working
twice as hard.

03:38.837 --> 03:41.034
You know, it's just really weird.

03:41.208 --> 03:45.650
You don't like eating animals, but you love
watching them tear each other apart.

03:45.818 --> 03:49.188
No, l don't-- Get him. Get him!

03:49.357 --> 03:52.558
Separate the sick one from the herd!

03:53.065 --> 03:55.126
-l'm gonna go.
-Why?

03:55.369 --> 03:58.273
l haven't been home in days,
and l need to get more clothes.

03:58.476 --> 04:01.277
You don't have to go.
l have something that'll fit you.

04:02.383 --> 04:05.584
l put that tube top on as a joke.

04:06.693 --> 04:09.357
-l want you to stay.
-l want to stay too.

04:09.532 --> 04:12.128
But l've got as much use
out of these boxers as l can.

04:12.538 --> 04:14.508
-Why don't you turn them inside--
-Done it.

04:16.211 --> 04:19.308
-l'll be back in a couple of hours.
-All right. l'll miss you.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.716
Me too.

04:23.092 --> 04:25.494
Oh, fine. Yeah, you got away.

04:25.664 --> 04:28.693
But don't look so smug.
You're gonna bleed to death.

04:29.906 --> 04:33.505
You know what? l just realized something.
l don't want to go home.

04:33.713 --> 04:38.017
-Great! Okay, l'll go get the tube top.
-No, no, what l mean is...

04:38.188 --> 04:41.024
...l hate going back
to my apartment now.

04:41.228 --> 04:45.396
Partly because l live above
a known crack den...

04:45.571 --> 04:48.771
...but, you know, mostly because
when l'm there, l really miss you.

04:50.547 --> 04:52.779
So...

04:53.385 --> 04:56.186
...do you want to move in together?

04:56.893 --> 04:59.363
Wow, Mike Hanigan...

04:59.532 --> 05:02.732
...you sure know how to
make a girl say ''Hell, yeah.''

05:03.372 --> 05:06.937
-So we're doing it?
-Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.683
-We're really gonna move in together?
-Yeah.

05:12.256 --> 05:16.162
l've always wanted to live with a guy.

05:16.331 --> 05:19.098
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.

05:19.270 --> 05:22.903
No, we are not having sex anymore.

05:23.078 --> 05:25.743
lt's gonna be fun.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.989
Shame on you, <i>TV Guide</i>.

05:31.161 --> 05:33.962
A man's ass is not nudity!

05:35.202 --> 05:38.140
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey.

05:38.375 --> 05:42.076
Listen, l need to know
that what l'm about to ask you...

05:42.250 --> 05:45.815
...will never get back to Chandler.

05:48.429 --> 05:52.734
l'd be lying if l said l hadn't
thought about it myself.

05:54.407 --> 05:58.472
But Chandler is my best friend.
lt would be wrong.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.747
Good, but wrong.

06:02.991 --> 06:06.486
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.070
But that's not what l'm here to talk
to you about. l need to borrow money.

06:10.272 --> 06:13.472
Oh, l don't know, Monica.
You know...

06:13.646 --> 06:15.673
...lending friends money
is always a mistake.

06:15.851 --> 06:20.121
-But Chandler lent you money.
-And he would tell you it was a mistake.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.891
Come on, l just.... l need it
for some rent and some other bills.

06:26.004 --> 06:27.199
Well, how much?

06:27.373 --> 06:30.209
-Two thousand dollars?
-Two thousand dollars?

06:30.379 --> 06:34.012
What do you think l am,
a soap opera star?

06:34.187 --> 06:36.886
-Yeah.
-That's right, l am.

06:37.393 --> 06:39.363
Promise me you'll never tell Chandler.

06:39.698 --> 06:41.759
lt'll really hurt his pride.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.100
Chandler? Pride?

06:44.274 --> 06:47.371
l know, he thinks he has it.
lt's really cute.

06:48.415 --> 06:50.750
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

06:50.921 --> 06:54.257
-What's in the bag?
-You know how Emma started crawling?

06:54.427 --> 06:58.390
l realized that this place
is very unsafe for a baby...

06:58.570 --> 07:02.510
...so l went to the store and l got some
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

07:02.711 --> 07:04.704
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

07:04.915 --> 07:08.376
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when l was a kid, it was like:

07:08.556 --> 07:11.790
''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''

07:11.963 --> 07:16.131
Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted
himself again.''

07:17.073 --> 07:20.945
Anyway, are you going to get
a handyman to install this stuff?

07:21.114 --> 07:24.610
No, l was just gonna do it myself.

07:26.926 --> 07:29.762
-You're gonna do it?
-Yeah. Why?

07:29.932 --> 07:34.704
-You don't think a woman can do this?
-Women can. You can't.

07:35.944 --> 07:40.009
Monica, will you please tell Joey
that he is a pig.

07:40.185 --> 07:43.955
-You're a pig. And you can't do this.
-What?

07:44.127 --> 07:47.658
What? Come on, l found
the hardware store all by myself.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.701
The store's right down the street.

07:49.905 --> 07:53.469
There is a hardware store
right down the street?

07:56.017 --> 07:59.217
Hey, you guys?
Okay, we've got great news.

07:59.390 --> 08:02.830
-Phoebe and l are moving in together.
-Congratulations.

08:02.998 --> 08:06.529
l know, it's so exciting. You know,
l've never lived with a guy before.

08:06.739 --> 08:10.679
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.250
Unless they're playing ''This ls What
My Sister Would Look Like.''

08:15.222 --> 08:17.716
Yeah, she's not so cute.

08:18.362 --> 08:21.597
-l'm gonna go to the bathroom.
-Well, you put down the toilet seat.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.772
Yes, dear.

08:24.775 --> 08:28.214
-ls that a bit you guys do?
-Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

08:30.587 --> 08:33.787
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.194
Yes, dear.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.703
l can't believe you're moving in together.
l'm happy for you guys.

08:40.874 --> 08:44.074
l mean, he's a great catch.
And those eyes....

08:45.784 --> 08:48.813
l'm a scientist. l observe.

08:50.025 --> 08:53.556
Gosh, this is so exciting!
You guys are really moving along.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.637
-l hear wedding bells.
-Monica, slow down, okay?

08:56.806 --> 08:59.470
l'm just excited to be living with him.

08:59.645 --> 09:01.638
You know, l mean, l don't know...

09:01.816 --> 09:05.220
...can l see someday being
married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

09:05.422 --> 09:08.862
l could picture myself walking down
the aisle in a wedding dress...

09:09.030 --> 09:12.526
...that highlights my breasts
in an obvious yet classy way.

09:14.541 --> 09:17.513
But do l want that house in Connecticut
near the good schools...

09:17.681 --> 09:22.349
...where Mike and l could send
little Sophie and Mike Jr.?

09:22.524 --> 09:24.220
Oh, my God, l do.

09:24.895 --> 09:29.393
-l had no idea you were so conventional.
-l know. l guess l am.

09:29.571 --> 09:33.237
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
l want to be a soccer mom.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.019
-You ready to go?
-Yeah, you bet, roomie.

09:38.221 --> 09:41.489
Don't you mean ''groomie''?

09:43.031 --> 09:46.197
Honey, leave the terrible jokes to me.

09:46.572 --> 09:48.667
-What are you talking about?
-Please.

09:48.843 --> 09:53.683
We haven't even moved in yet, and
they have us picking out china patterns.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.600
China patterns!

10:06.277 --> 10:09.374
This is easy. ''Can't do this....''

10:14.561 --> 10:17.761
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

10:24.948 --> 10:27.145
-Hey, Joe.
-Hey.

10:28.522 --> 10:30.286
You here with somebody?

10:30.459 --> 10:32.326
No.

10:34.066 --> 10:37.528
Look, l need to ask you a favor,
and we can't tell Monica anything about it.

10:37.707 --> 10:42.171
-l thought you guys didn't have secrets.
-That will remain the official party line.

10:45.022 --> 10:48.461
Look, Monica and l are having
a little financial trouble.

10:48.796 --> 10:52.235
-Yeah, l know.
-What? What do you mean, you ''know''?

10:54.775 --> 10:56.768
l just figured it out, you know?

10:56.945 --> 11:01.477
l mean, you're not working,
and the economy is bad.

11:01.822 --> 11:03.051
Oh, right.

11:03.258 --> 11:06.561
That is the fastest l have ever thought.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.401
Anyway...

11:10.707 --> 11:12.870
...l need to borrow some money.

11:13.078 --> 11:16.073
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?

11:18.488 --> 11:21.324
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?

11:24.333 --> 11:29.207
l know how much you used to make,
and l know how much your rent is.

11:30.045 --> 11:32.106
Oh, okay.

11:32.282 --> 11:34.617
l am on fire.

11:35.723 --> 11:38.923
Listen, this is really nice.

11:40.265 --> 11:43.362
Did you write a check to Monica
for $2000?

11:43.539 --> 11:45.132
Did Monica borrow money from you?

11:47.112 --> 11:49.777
-Kind of.
-l can't believe her.

11:49.951 --> 11:52.080
Did she tell you we were having
money problems?

11:52.289 --> 11:55.227
No, no, no. lt wasn't because
of your money problems.

11:55.395 --> 11:58.424
lt was for something for her.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.298
What?

12:00.472 --> 12:01.600
Something personal.

12:01.842 --> 12:04.814
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?

12:04.981 --> 12:06.244
Excuse me.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.959
Boob job.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.800
What? That's ridiculous.
She doesn't need a boob job.

12:20.947 --> 12:23.008
Why wouldn't she tell me about it?

12:23.184 --> 12:25.917
She was afraid you wouldn't be supportive.

12:26.123 --> 12:28.993
-l'm not.
-She knows you well.

12:29.163 --> 12:31.862
You can't tell her that you know.
l swore l wouldn't tell.

12:32.469 --> 12:35.032
A boob job? She doesn't need that.
That's crazy.

12:35.208 --> 12:38.112
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

12:38.281 --> 12:41.812
Making them smaller,
that would be crazy.

12:44.961 --> 12:47.831
Hey, so where do you keep
your secret box of porn?

12:49.403 --> 12:51.840
l don't have any porn.

12:52.409 --> 12:55.210
Back of the closet in my bedroom.

12:56.050 --> 13:00.013
Oh, hey, l wanted to ask you
about Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.

13:00.191 --> 13:04.063
Well, l think the reason people laughed
is that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''

13:06.872 --> 13:11.576
l get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

13:11.748 --> 13:15.448
No, the thing l want to say is....

13:15.756 --> 13:18.318
Maybe we should've
talked about this before.

13:18.494 --> 13:22.765
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?

13:22.971 --> 13:25.772
-Oh, no, no. Not at all.
-Okay.

13:25.977 --> 13:29.416
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.

13:29.985 --> 13:33.982
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

13:34.928 --> 13:38.298
-What do you mean?
-Look, Phoebe, l....

13:38.468 --> 13:42.910
l love you very much.
But l never want to get married again.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.522
-Wow.
-lt's just, my first marriage was...

13:49.691 --> 13:54.029
...you know, such a disaster that
l kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

13:54.199 --> 13:56.499
-Was it that bad?
-At one point, near the end...

13:56.672 --> 14:01.010
-...she deliberately defecated on my--
-Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

14:02.449 --> 14:06.584
But don't you think it might be
different with someone else? Perhaps...

14:06.758 --> 14:09.490
...a blond who always
uses the toilet?

14:11.768 --> 14:15.229
Except for once in the ocean.

14:15.676 --> 14:18.044
Look, it's not about who l would marry.

14:18.214 --> 14:21.745
l was certain the first time l got married
it'd last forever. l was wrong.

14:21.988 --> 14:24.619
-But, it just--
-Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

14:24.794 --> 14:27.094
l just never want to get married again.

14:30.205 --> 14:31.799
l'm sorry.

14:32.442 --> 14:36.907
Are you okay with that? lf not, maybe
us moving in together isn't the best idea.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.583
No. Oh, l definitely don't
want to get married.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.632
l just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to, too.

14:45.936 --> 14:48.772
Because if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

14:48.942 --> 14:50.844
...there is gonna be
hell to pay, mister.

14:51.648 --> 14:54.483
-Trust me. l will never--
-Yeah, l get that. Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.904
Hi. So you gave in
and decided to call someone?

15:04.139 --> 15:08.409
Yeah. l don't know who l was kidding.
l can barely use chopsticks.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.645
-You're all set.
-Oh, thank you so much.

15:11.855 --> 15:14.121
Wait. You forgot your...

15:14.293 --> 15:16.730
...game.

15:16.898 --> 15:18.457
Thank you.

15:18.635 --> 15:21.766
-Rach, is this my sweater?
-Yeah.

15:21.942 --> 15:23.741
What happened to the sleeve?

15:24.547 --> 15:26.710
Moths?

15:28.221 --> 15:32.925
Hey, Rach. There she is,
my perfectly proportioned wife.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.797
Don't look at me.
l never get his jokes.

15:38.909 --> 15:41.106
-Thank you?
-No, no. Don't thank me.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.243
Thank you. Do you know there is not
one thing l would change about you?

15:45.455 --> 15:48.690
Not one single thing.
And definitely not...

15:48.896 --> 15:51.264
...two single things.

15:51.968 --> 15:56.637
Okay, you're being weird. Do you want
sex, or did you do something bad?

15:56.811 --> 16:00.477
No. No. No. l just love
the way you look. l am warm...

16:00.653 --> 16:03.453
...for your form.

16:04.994 --> 16:08.330
Okay, you know the old classics like,
you know, ''You look nice''?

16:08.502 --> 16:09.629
They're still okay.

16:10.004 --> 16:13.272
But ''you look nice'' could mean
that l'm saying, ''Your face looks nice.''

16:13.444 --> 16:15.972
l want to compliment your body.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.513
l mean, l wouldn't change it at all.

16:19.691 --> 16:23.460
And more specifically, l wouldn't
want anything to get any bigger.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.164
-Okay.
-l mean...

16:26.337 --> 16:29.468
...you wouldn't want any part of me
to get any bigger, would you?

16:32.516 --> 16:34.782
Don't answer that.

16:38.094 --> 16:41.089
Just when you thought that dude
couldn't get any weirder.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.039
Why do you think he was so worried
about me getting bigger?

16:45.241 --> 16:48.441
l don't know.
l mean, what brought that on?

16:48.615 --> 16:51.484
Oh, my God. You know what,
we're trying to get pregnant...

16:51.654 --> 16:54.990
...so he's probably starting to freak out
that my body's gonna change.

16:55.161 --> 16:57.632
-You think that's what it is?
-You heard him.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.771
''No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger.''

17:00.939 --> 17:05.346
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.

17:07.787 --> 17:10.918
-l'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
-Yeah. lf you don't, l will.

17:11.093 --> 17:14.828
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

17:15.001 --> 17:17.335
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

17:17.506 --> 17:20.443
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

17:23.952 --> 17:26.445
God, it's just such a magical time.

17:32.970 --> 17:36.306
Hi. Listen, l wanted to ask you
something about marriage.

17:36.511 --> 17:38.377
Now you're seeking me out
to make jokes?

17:38.548 --> 17:42.511
l mean, l can see if we're all hanging
out, but to come to my home....

17:42.723 --> 17:45.159
No, l really want to know
how you feel about it.

17:45.328 --> 17:49.029
-Why?
-Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

17:49.737 --> 17:51.707
-Never?
-Never.

17:51.875 --> 17:55.177
Wow. Are you still gonna
move in with him?

17:55.549 --> 18:00.081
l want to, but l wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.

18:00.258 --> 18:04.700
You know, that l won't be missing out
on anything. That marriage stinks.

18:05.769 --> 18:08.433
Yeah, marriage stinks.

18:09.309 --> 18:13.717
l mean, if you want to see a man gain
weight and a woman stop shaving...

18:13.885 --> 18:16.584
...get them married.

18:16.758 --> 18:19.889
-That's not how you really feel, is it?
-No, l'm sorry.

18:21.066 --> 18:25.633
l know it's not what you want to hear,
but l can't help it. l love marriage.

18:25.842 --> 18:28.074
Seriously, you?
''Divorce-o''?

18:29.115 --> 18:34.114
lf you have to call me a name, l'd prefer
''Ross, the Divorcer.'' lt's just cooler.

18:35.428 --> 18:39.368
Look, l know my marriages
didn't exactly work out...

18:39.537 --> 18:42.737
...but, you know, l loved being
that committed to another person.

18:42.943 --> 18:46.781
And Carol and l had some good times
before she became a lesbian.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.684
And once afterward.

18:49.857 --> 18:52.191
Anyway, l'm sorry.

18:52.963 --> 18:54.796
lt's okay. That's how you feel.

18:56.270 --> 18:58.969
But, come on, l mean,
living together will be great.

18:59.142 --> 19:01.978
l mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.849
-l do love Mike.
-Yeah, see?

19:05.054 --> 19:08.356
And you were so excited about
moving in together before...

19:08.528 --> 19:11.021
...and you know what, you should be.
lt's a big deal.

19:12.335 --> 19:14.772
Yeah, l guess you're right.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.103
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

19:17.345 --> 19:19.873
The Divorcer to the rescue.

19:20.619 --> 19:23.682
-lt's not cooler.
-Yeah, l just heard it.

19:37.118 --> 19:38.484
Rach?

19:46.971 --> 19:49.568
Rachel?!

20:01.934 --> 20:05.304
So l can't do anything l like?!

20:11.854 --> 20:13.288
Unbelievable.

20:13.457 --> 20:16.919
Chandler wants you to have a baby, but
he doesn't want your body to change.

20:17.098 --> 20:18.727
lt's not like he's so perfect.

20:18.902 --> 20:20.495
-Hey, that's my husband.
-All right.

20:20.672 --> 20:23.508
Let's solve one problem at a time.

20:24.780 --> 20:27.148
Hey, Rach.

20:27.318 --> 20:31.053
Perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

20:31.226 --> 20:32.251
-Honey?
-Yeah?

20:32.428 --> 20:34.729
About that.

20:35.702 --> 20:40.109
-l'm going to change.
-Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

20:40.344 --> 20:42.405
l'm gonna get bigger.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.016
Honey, l....

20:44.185 --> 20:47.180
l love your breasts the way they are.

20:47.593 --> 20:50.063
Fascist.

20:50.632 --> 20:53.695
My breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.

20:53.905 --> 20:57.366
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.

20:57.579 --> 21:00.106
Your ass?!

21:00.351 --> 21:05.157
And don't be surprised if her hands
and her feet get bigger too.

21:05.361 --> 21:08.801
-They do that?
-lt's kind of a package deal.

21:10.237 --> 21:13.506
God, why? Why would you want to
do that to yourself?

21:13.745 --> 21:16.443
l thought it was something
that we both wanted.

21:16.951 --> 21:20.618
lf it means that much to you, l may be
able to get onboard with the boobs...

21:20.792 --> 21:24.492
...but the giant ass
and the big clown feet?

21:25.502 --> 21:27.198
Oh, my God, Chandler.

21:27.405 --> 21:30.468
lf you can't handle this,
what will you be like in the hospital...

21:30.645 --> 21:34.847
...with the blood and screaming and the
little person that's shooting out of her?

21:37.726 --> 21:39.126
What?

21:46.309 --> 21:50.010
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?

21:50.384 --> 21:52.878
Because she is.

21:53.056 --> 21:56.894
-Chandler knows l borrowed the money.
-For your boob job.

21:57.465 --> 21:58.900
-Joe....
-lt's over.

21:59.102 --> 22:04.238
Okay, so l'm out $4000 and
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

22:08.554 --> 22:13.222
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

22:14.432 --> 22:16.265
-Better.
-Yeah?

22:16.604 --> 22:18.506
Very cool.

22:20.110 --> 22:23.948
Hey, Pheebs? You know, l'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...

22:24.118 --> 22:27.147
-...and l hope l was a little helpful.
-Yeah, you were helpful.

22:27.324 --> 22:29.123
-Yeah. No, thank you.
-Good. Good.

22:29.328 --> 22:32.665
Because the more l thought about it,
the more l realized...

22:32.836 --> 22:36.537
...l don't think marriage is necessarily
the right path for you.

22:36.811 --> 22:37.938
What do you mean?

22:38.113 --> 22:40.174
l know the other day
in the coffeehouse...

22:40.350 --> 22:43.481
...you were all caught up
in the whole soccer-mom thing...

22:43.658 --> 22:47.860
...but is that really you? l mean, can you
honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

22:49.001 --> 22:51.802
They are awfully boxy.

22:53.376 --> 22:57.511
People like me like stability
and security. You don't.

22:57.686 --> 23:00.054
And that's what's so incredible
about you.

23:00.224 --> 23:04.563
You got this wild and crazy life.

23:04.733 --> 23:10.609
l mean, l don't know, you'd be so bored
with marriage. l mean, it's so normal.

23:12.348 --> 23:13.908
Yeah.

23:14.085 --> 23:15.645
Hey, can l help?

23:15.855 --> 23:19.419
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...

23:19.596 --> 23:23.934
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last
three feet are where it gets really tricky.

23:26.276 --> 23:30.239
You know, sometimes your words,
they hurt.

23:31.486 --> 23:33.980
Hey, where do you guys want this?

23:34.158 --> 23:36.789
Yeah, seriously,
because this is really heavy.

23:36.964 --> 23:41.405
l mean, not for me, because l'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

23:43.276 --> 23:49.050
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room? None at all?

23:49.990 --> 23:52.426
No, but you don't want to
get married either, right?

23:52.629 --> 23:53.824
Right.

23:53.998 --> 23:56.366
Except that l do want to get married.

23:56.570 --> 23:59.701
Couldn't have had this conversation
down at the truck, huh?

24:00.945 --> 24:02.574
What? You want to get married?

24:03.183 --> 24:04.446
Someday.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.955
And...hernia.

24:09.462 --> 24:15.373
l haven't had a normal life. And l never
felt like l was missing out on anything.

24:15.541 --> 24:19.982
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.556
Why didn't you say something before?

24:23.758 --> 24:28.358
l didn't know how much l wanted it. And
l love you, and l wanted to live with you.

24:28.534 --> 24:31.004
l want to live with you too.
l mean, let's do that.

24:31.205 --> 24:33.266
But l don't think l can.

24:33.443 --> 24:37.383
lt was okay to move in when
l didn't know what was gonna happen.

24:37.552 --> 24:41.082
But l can't move in knowing nothing
is ever gonna happen.

24:41.259 --> 24:44.824
l said to bring the cushions
up first, but no.

24:47.672 --> 24:52.204
Can we at least try living together? You
might change your mind about marriage.

24:52.414 --> 24:55.409
Are you gonna change yours?

24:55.989 --> 24:58.050
No.

24:58.226 --> 25:00.823
Me neither.

25:05.040 --> 25:09.573
l think l need to be with someone
who wants what l want.

25:12.187 --> 25:13.816
But l don't want this to end.

25:14.091 --> 25:16.961
No, l don't want it to end either.

25:20.037 --> 25:23.168
l can't believe this is gonna end.

25:25.715 --> 25:28.049
l guess l'll have my stuff picked up.

25:28.988 --> 25:30.981
Yeah. Okay.

25:34.298 --> 25:37.429
Okay, so....

25:50.565 --> 25:52.660
Goodbye.

25:53.904 --> 25:57.639
-Take it easy, Mike.
-Bye, Mike.

26:01.653 --> 26:03.178
l'm so sorry, Pheebs.

26:03.356 --> 26:06.089
We're all sorry.

26:08.801 --> 26:14.108
Look on the bright side. At least you
won't have to live with this ugly chair.

26:14.813 --> 26:17.649
That was here already, huh?

26:17.886 --> 26:20.288
l love you.

26:31.312 --> 26:33.840
l did it! l did it!

26:34.051 --> 26:37.046
All right.

26:41.132 --> 26:44.503
l'd better take all l can carry.

26:45.140 --> 26:49.080
Who knows when l'll be able
to get in here again, huh?
