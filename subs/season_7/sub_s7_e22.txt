WEBVTT

00:01.446 --> 00:05.382
I think I'II go with the chicken piccata
instead of the Cornish game hen.

00:05.551 --> 00:08.384
WiII there be a vegetarian option,
you know, for me?

00:08.687 --> 00:10.154
Yes. DefiniteIy.

00:10.322 --> 00:11.311
What is it?

00:11.790 --> 00:12.916
Dancing.

00:15.694 --> 00:16.991
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:17.162 --> 00:19.653
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

00:19.831 --> 00:23.358
Can I get the keys?
Thought I'd take that bad boy for a spin.

00:23.535 --> 00:28.438
Ross drives it? When I ask, you say
you're the onIy one aIIowed to drive it.

00:28.607 --> 00:32.065
He's my brother, pIus he drives
so sIow he couId never hurt it.

00:32.244 --> 00:34.974
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

00:35.581 --> 00:39.642
Just repIace the buIbs in the
brake Iights after you're done.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.019
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:43.188 --> 00:47.591
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

00:50.829 --> 00:55.357
-You Iet Joey drive it?
-I've never driven it. Not once.

00:55.534 --> 00:58.526
Okay, once.
Okay, I drive it aII the time.

01:01.006 --> 01:05.033
So much for the ''you-can-drive-it
but-don't-teII-RacheI'' pIan.

01:06.244 --> 01:08.212
Wow, I can't beIieve you Iied to me.

01:08.380 --> 01:13.340
I can fi<i>x</i> this. Monica, RacheI thinks
aII you taIk about is the wedding.

01:16.221 --> 01:19.622
There. I've bIown both your secrets.
Now we're even.

01:21.393 --> 01:26.194
I won't Iet you drive the Porsche
because you're a terribIe driver.

01:26.365 --> 01:28.833
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

01:30.502 --> 01:35.269
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'II take you around the bIock.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.964
You got a coupIe hours?

01:38.710 --> 01:40.871
The One With ChandIer's Dad

02:16.481 --> 02:19.143
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

02:20.652 --> 02:24.850
-Take the top down, did you?
-OnIy way to fIy.

02:25.023 --> 02:29.756
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an e<i>x</i>ceIIent driver.

02:29.928 --> 02:34.024
You're fast and irresponsibIe.
That adds up to a bad driver.

02:34.199 --> 02:37.794
In high schooI, that added up
to head cheerIeader.

02:41.873 --> 02:45.365
Did you see the Iook
that girI just gave me?

02:45.677 --> 02:48.305
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.916
-She's checking out your beehive.
-What?

02:52.918 --> 02:54.943
-Give me a brush.
-The keys.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.747
-No way!
-WeII, no brush.

02:56.922 --> 02:58.787
Fine. It doesn't matter.

02:58.957 --> 03:03.792
If I remember correctIy, there's
a comb on the fIoor of the bathroom.

03:20.078 --> 03:21.067
AIimony.

03:25.317 --> 03:28.684
We stiII haven't gotten
an RSVP from your dad.

03:28.854 --> 03:33.416
Oh, right. Maybe that's because I
didn't send him an invitation.

03:34.192 --> 03:35.181
Why not?

03:35.360 --> 03:39.126
An invitation?
That's Iike aImost asking him to come.

03:40.031 --> 03:43.330
He's your father.
He shouId be at our wedding.

03:43.502 --> 03:46.335
I was gonna send him an invite
but then I saw the stamp.

03:46.505 --> 03:50.202
It was one of those MariIyn Monroe stamps
and I thought:

03:50.375 --> 03:52.741
My dad has that dress.

03:53.245 --> 03:57.682
Wow. That must be a very different view
when he stands over an air vent.

03:58.517 --> 04:01.884
You shouId see him singing
''Happy Birthday, Mr. President.''

04:02.687 --> 04:04.052
We have to invite him.

04:04.222 --> 04:08.215
I don't even know the man.
I haven't seen him in years.

04:08.393 --> 04:10.918
And when he finds out
he wasn't asked?

04:11.096 --> 04:13.496
We don't run in the same circIes.

04:13.665 --> 04:16.600
I hang out with you guys and he...

04:16.935 --> 04:19.426
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

04:20.705 --> 04:23.037
I think I want to trade circIes.

04:23.208 --> 04:26.268
You don't want him there.
Nobody wiII stare at the bride...

04:26.444 --> 04:29.811
...when the father of the groom
is wearing a backIess dress.

04:29.981 --> 04:34.680
So what? As Iong as he's not wearing
a white dress and veiI, I don't care.

04:34.853 --> 04:37.344
I think I need to do some shopping.

04:45.430 --> 04:46.897
Nice.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.328
My God!

04:51.903 --> 04:55.964
-What do you think you're doing?
-Just washing the windshieId.

05:00.812 --> 05:03.804
There's no way I'II Iet you
drive this car.

05:03.982 --> 05:06.883
-CouIdn't find the comb?
-No.

05:07.052 --> 05:08.986
Why don't you just hand over the keys.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.586
Oh!

05:11.356 --> 05:13.824
Do not start this car.

05:17.028 --> 05:19.929
Okay, okay.
I wiII give you 20 bucks...

05:20.098 --> 05:23.499
...if you get out of this car
right now. Hey!

05:25.570 --> 05:26.798
Look.

05:26.972 --> 05:29.566
If you're so freaked out,
just get in the car.

05:29.741 --> 05:31.436
With you? Yeah, right.

05:31.610 --> 05:32.838
AII right.

05:33.011 --> 05:34.740
Okay, okay, okay.

05:38.950 --> 05:42.886
-What are you doing? Get in the front.
-In the death seat?!

05:49.461 --> 05:51.258
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, sweetie.

05:51.429 --> 05:54.865
-Ready to go?
-My purse is at Monica's. I'II be back.

05:55.033 --> 05:56.864
-Wait a minute.
-What? Oh.

06:03.608 --> 06:05.200
That one kept going.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.182
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

06:12.384 --> 06:15.251
-How Iong have you been going out?
-Over a month.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.911
We ought to get
to know each other better.

06:18.089 --> 06:21.684
-Sure. I'd Iike that.
-Yeah. So, uh....

06:22.527 --> 06:24.324
What's your name?

06:26.765 --> 06:28.426
-It's Jake.
-Joey.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.864
-Do you Iike the Knicks?
-Yeah, big fan.

06:32.037 --> 06:35.495
Me too. There's a game on Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

06:35.674 --> 06:39.405
Great! Let me make sure I'm not
doing anything Tuesday.

06:47.519 --> 06:48.850
Here.

06:49.487 --> 06:52.820
-What's this?
-Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

06:52.991 --> 06:56.188
Are you serious? EIoping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

06:56.361 --> 07:00.764
No more these fIowers, these fIowers.
Think of the money we'II save.

07:00.932 --> 07:04.834
We're not eIoping. I Iove the fIowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, pIease?

07:05.971 --> 07:07.768
We're going to see your dad.

07:07.939 --> 07:10.430
I want to get to know
my father-in-Iaw.

07:10.608 --> 07:12.838
We aIready went over this and I won.

07:13.011 --> 07:15.946
No, you didn't.
Honey, just so you know....

07:16.114 --> 07:19.641
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

07:20.485 --> 07:24.182
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

07:24.656 --> 07:27.022
I know your dad embarrassed you.

07:27.192 --> 07:29.786
AII kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

07:29.961 --> 07:33.226
You'd have to come up with a new word
for what I went through.

07:33.898 --> 07:36.662
In high schooI,
he came to aII my swim meets...

07:36.835 --> 07:39.668
...dressed as a different
HoIIywood starIet.

07:39.904 --> 07:41.166
It's hard enough to be 1 4.

07:41.339 --> 07:46.208
You're skinny, you're wearing Speedos
that your mom promised you'd grow into.

07:48.213 --> 07:51.239
You Iook up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

07:51.416 --> 07:55.375
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with reaI fruit...

07:55.553 --> 08:00.013
...that he wiII Iater hand out
to your friends as a heaIthy snack.

08:00.859 --> 08:02.383
But he was there!

08:02.560 --> 08:05.552
My dad didn't come
to one of my Brownie meetings.

08:06.164 --> 08:07.290
You were a Brownie?

08:07.665 --> 08:09.360
No. I ate them.

08:11.469 --> 08:15.929
The point is, he was at every one
of your swim meets, cheering you on.

08:16.107 --> 08:18.007
That's a pretty great dad.

08:18.176 --> 08:20.144
He had se<i>x</i> with Mr. GaribaIdi.

08:20.545 --> 08:23.639
-Who's Mr. GaribaIdi?
-Does it matter?!

08:27.018 --> 08:31.717
You're not 1 4 anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you Iet that stuff go.

08:32.791 --> 08:38.195
If he's not at your wedding,
you'II regret it for the rest of your Iife.

08:40.498 --> 08:43.296
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

08:45.937 --> 08:49.873
-So I never get to win anymore?
-How much did you ever win before?

08:55.814 --> 08:59.875
You know how when you're wearing pants
and you Iean forward...

09:00.051 --> 09:02.281
...I check out your underwear?

09:03.455 --> 09:05.787
WeII, when Jake did it...

09:05.957 --> 09:09.393
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

09:09.561 --> 09:11.358
I know. They were mine.

09:12.597 --> 09:13.586
Oh!

09:14.899 --> 09:17.265
No, no, wait. That's weird.

09:17.936 --> 09:21.303
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

09:21.873 --> 09:22.862
That's weird!

09:23.041 --> 09:26.875
-I'm wearing his briefs right now.
-That's kind of hot.

09:27.612 --> 09:32.606
I think so too. And that IittIe fIap?
It's great for hoIding my Iipstick.

09:38.189 --> 09:40.020
I wouIdn't know about that.

09:41.493 --> 09:45.793
Jake says that women's underwear
is actuaIIy more comfortabIe.

09:45.964 --> 09:48.865
He Ioves how siIk feeIs
against his skin.

09:49.033 --> 09:52.935
Ne<i>x</i>t he'II say your high heeIs
are good for his posture.

09:53.805 --> 09:57.172
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is aII man.

09:57.342 --> 09:58.900
I think more than you.

09:59.077 --> 10:02.945
He Iooked Iike a reaI Iumberjack
in those pink Iacies.

10:04.215 --> 10:08.242
I'm just saying onIy a man compIeteIy
secure in his mascuIinity...

10:08.419 --> 10:11.752
...couId wear women's underwear.
I don't think you couId.

10:11.923 --> 10:15.916
-I am secure with my mascuIinity.
-Okay, whatever.

10:16.094 --> 10:18.722
You've seen my huge stack of porn, right?

10:22.066 --> 10:23.795
Here you go.

10:26.037 --> 10:28.801
Look aII you want.
There's nothing there.

10:36.848 --> 10:40.443
SIow down,
or I am returning to the back seat.

10:41.386 --> 10:43.149
WouId you caIm down?

10:43.321 --> 10:46.415
No! You're driving 1 5 miIes
over the speed Iimit.

10:46.591 --> 10:51.187
I'm driving 5 miIes over the Iimit.
They raised it by 1 0.

10:51.763 --> 10:53.924
What, are they crazy?!

10:59.037 --> 11:01.938
God, I forgot how much I Iove driving.

11:02.507 --> 11:04.839
I have got to get my Iicense renewed.

11:07.912 --> 11:12.008
You don't have a vaIid driver's Iicense?
PuII over right now.

11:12.183 --> 11:16.051
Ross, you're so tense.
You just gotta reIa<i>x</i>, okay?

11:16.221 --> 11:20.419
Just need to reIa<i>x</i>. AII right?
Just need to reIa<i>x</i>.

11:20.758 --> 11:24.421
What are you--? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

11:24.596 --> 11:27.030
I am not horsing around, okay?

11:27.198 --> 11:30.361
I am ''Porsche-ing'' around.

11:35.273 --> 11:36.501
Uh-oh.

11:37.442 --> 11:42.505
Stay caIm. Nothing wiII happen.
You're not in that much troubIe.

11:42.914 --> 11:44.074
ReaIIy? You think so?

11:44.682 --> 11:47.082
I was taIking to myseIf.
You're going down!

12:30.995 --> 12:32.656
Has someone taken your order?

12:32.830 --> 12:36.357
Oh, yeah. She did. He did. She?

12:36.534 --> 12:38.365
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't....

12:40.638 --> 12:43.869
-I just ordered a beer.
-You're straight. I get it.

12:46.711 --> 12:48.975
If we caIIed your dad,
we'd have better seats.

12:49.147 --> 12:52.947
I don't want him to know we're here yet.
I'm not ready for that.

12:53.117 --> 12:55.915
Besides, he won't be too happy
to see me either.

12:56.087 --> 12:57.520
Why not?

12:58.323 --> 12:59.813
I don't know if I toId you...

12:59.991 --> 13:04.257
...but he's kind of tried to contact me
a Iot the Iast few years.

13:04.429 --> 13:05.453
What?

13:05.630 --> 13:08.724
Yeah. He's made phone caIIs,
written Ietters.

13:08.900 --> 13:12.563
He came to New York.
But I aIways said I was too busy.

13:12.737 --> 13:15.865
It's very ''Cats in the CradIe.''
I don't want to get into it.

13:18.910 --> 13:20.241
Here we go.

13:20.411 --> 13:23.972
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome the incomparable...</i>

13:24.148 --> 13:26.309
<i>...Helena Handbasket.</i>

13:30.521 --> 13:32.216
HeIIo, darIings.

13:32.390 --> 13:34.381
And there's Daddy.

13:40.965 --> 13:44.230
Switch pIaces with me. Come on!
I'II go under, you go over.

13:44.402 --> 13:47.371
-Yeah, I'II get right on that.
-Come on!

13:47.538 --> 13:50.507
-What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.
-Come on!

13:50.675 --> 13:52.836
I'm sure we won't get arrested
for this.

13:54.946 --> 13:56.174
God!

13:59.717 --> 14:03.380
Hi, officer.
Was I going a IittIe too fast?

14:03.588 --> 14:05.180
Oh, my God.

14:06.057 --> 14:09.220
-Can I see your Iicense, pIease?
-AbsoIuteIy.

14:09.394 --> 14:14.889
It's weird. I had a dream Iast night
that I was stopped by a poIiceman.

14:15.066 --> 14:16.294
And then he....

14:16.467 --> 14:19.903
WeII, I probabIy shouIdn't
teII you the rest.

14:20.638 --> 14:22.265
He gave you a big...

14:22.440 --> 14:23.429
...fat...

14:23.608 --> 14:24.870
...ticket?

14:27.278 --> 14:32.215
-Your Iicense.
-Yes. Here you go, Officer...

14:32.383 --> 14:33.680
...Handsome.

14:34.452 --> 14:37.944
-It's Hanson.
-Oops, sorry. My mistake.

14:38.122 --> 14:39.783
Dear Lord!

14:41.292 --> 14:43.260
-Wow!
-Here it comes.

14:43.694 --> 14:45.355
This is a great picture.

14:46.764 --> 14:50.894
ReaIIy? You think so? You know,
I had just roIIed right out of bed.

14:51.068 --> 14:52.160
You Iook phenomenaI.

14:52.336 --> 14:55.237
She shouId!
It was taken 1 0 years ago!

14:58.743 --> 15:03.112
You know, you're probabIy wondering
about the oId date.

15:03.281 --> 15:06.250
Yes, I am. You're an A<i>q</i>uarius, huh?

15:07.985 --> 15:10.351
-I'II bet you're a Gemini.
-No.

15:10.521 --> 15:11.749
-Taurus?
-No.

15:12.390 --> 15:13.789
-Virgo?
-No.

15:14.358 --> 15:15.985
-Sagittarius?
-Yep.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.594
I knew it. I knew it!

15:18.763 --> 15:21.857
-You won't speed anymore, right?
-I won't speed.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.729
-And you promise to take care of this?
-I promise.

15:24.902 --> 15:27.530
In the meantime, Iet him drive.
Does he have a Iicense?

15:27.705 --> 15:30.265
-Can he handIe a stick?
-WeII....

15:30.441 --> 15:32.909
I can handIe a stick!

15:48.092 --> 15:52.426
-That can't be your father.
-I've been saying that for years.

15:52.597 --> 15:54.724
-Oh, my God!
-What?

15:54.899 --> 15:57.424
That's Mr. GaribaIdi
pIaying the piano.

16:11.482 --> 16:14.212
HeIIo, and weIcome to the show.

16:14.385 --> 16:18.219
I see some of our reguIars
in the audience.

16:18.589 --> 16:21.786
And a coupIe of irreguIars.

16:23.528 --> 16:28.022
-He's coming into the audience.
-ReIa<i>x</i>. You'II be fine.

16:28.199 --> 16:31.225
Oh, much better.
You're invisibIe now.

16:31.936 --> 16:34.666
-Where are you from?
-BakersfieId.

16:34.872 --> 16:36.931
-I'm sorry?
-BakersfieId.

16:37.441 --> 16:40.171
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

16:41.412 --> 16:44.939
It can't happen Iike this.
I'II meet you back at the hoteI.

16:45.383 --> 16:49.752
Look, a standing ovation aIready.
So earIy in the show.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.755
Turn around, darIing.
Let me see your pretty face.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.966
Can we have our drinks, pIease?
Waiter? --tress?

17:17.848 --> 17:19.907
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hey.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.787
Check it out.

17:29.126 --> 17:31.253
How much of a man am I?

17:31.429 --> 17:36.093
Wow, nice.
ManIy, and aIso kind of a sIut.

17:37.301 --> 17:40.862
I'm beginning to see what Jake
was taIking about.

17:41.038 --> 17:43.131
The siIk feeIs reaIIy good.

17:43.975 --> 17:48.708
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they wouId be.

17:48.946 --> 17:50.072
That's great.

17:50.247 --> 17:53.148
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

17:53.317 --> 17:58.584
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: cotton, siIk, Iace.

17:58.789 --> 18:02.418
You know what I've aIways
wondered about? Pantyhose!

18:02.627 --> 18:06.825
The way they start at your toe,
then they go aII the way up to--

18:10.101 --> 18:14.435
-I shouId go take these off, shouIdn't I?
-I think it's important you do.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.700
What's your name?

18:20.378 --> 18:21.845
ChandIer.

18:23.247 --> 18:24.305
ChandIer?

18:24.849 --> 18:26.749
What an unusuaI name.

18:27.051 --> 18:30.282
You must have had terribIy
fascinating parents.

18:30.688 --> 18:32.451
Oh, they're a hoot.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.354
And who is your friend?

18:36.827 --> 18:39.125
I'm Monica.

18:39.530 --> 18:43.193
-Monica. Where are you from?
-New York.

18:44.001 --> 18:46.435
I'm not very fond of New York.

18:46.604 --> 18:48.765
Queens, I Iike.

18:50.641 --> 18:52.666
What is this...

18:52.843 --> 18:56.904
...sparkIing something, honey, huh?

18:58.182 --> 19:01.049
ActuaIIy, Monica and I are engaged.

19:02.319 --> 19:03.809
ReaIIy?

19:04.488 --> 19:06.581
CongratuIations.

19:07.258 --> 19:09.158
When's the big day?

19:10.961 --> 19:12.724
In two weeks.

19:13.898 --> 19:15.331
I see.

19:16.901 --> 19:21.395
WeII, I wish you both
a Iifetime of happiness.

19:22.473 --> 19:24.134
So, you're baId.

19:24.642 --> 19:25.631
Wait, wait.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.571
We'd Iove it if you couId be there.

19:33.884 --> 19:35.283
ReaIIy?

19:37.154 --> 19:39.349
I know it wouId make me happy...

19:40.758 --> 19:42.089
...ma'am.

19:44.795 --> 19:47.286
Then I wouIdn't miss it for the worId.

19:48.699 --> 19:51.566
I'm getting aII misty here.

19:51.736 --> 19:55.638
You'd think I was having my Iegs wa<i>x</i>ed
or something.

19:59.143 --> 20:01.737
-You okay?
-Yeah.

20:02.213 --> 20:04.704
Thanks for making me do this.

20:05.349 --> 20:09.581
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...

20:09.754 --> 20:12.621
...how Iucky they are
to have found each other.

20:13.624 --> 20:16.320
In every Iife a IittIe rain must faII.

20:16.494 --> 20:18.018
FortunateIy...

20:18.195 --> 20:20.095
...in my Iife....

20:34.812 --> 20:38.304
When I was growing up,
I pIayed the one on the far Ieft.

20:46.724 --> 20:48.749
I think you've had enough fun
for today.

20:49.727 --> 20:51.854
Remind me to introduce you
to someone.

20:52.029 --> 20:53.462
-Who?
-Fourth gear.

20:57.301 --> 21:00.702
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

21:00.871 --> 21:05.570
Maybe he saw your hands sIip briefIy
from the 1 0 and 2:00 position.

21:07.978 --> 21:12.347
Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to fIirt some more.

21:13.918 --> 21:17.251
Perhaps he didn't tarnish
the badge enough.

21:18.556 --> 21:20.649
It's a different guy.

21:23.627 --> 21:27.119
-Good evening, officer.
-Do you know how fast you were going?

21:27.298 --> 21:31.064
No, I don't, but it couIdn't
have been more than 60.

21:31.235 --> 21:33.032
You're right. It was 37.

21:38.042 --> 21:39.407
ReaIIy?

21:40.144 --> 21:43.136
-Can I see your Iicense, pIease?
-You're kidding.

21:43.314 --> 21:46.806
You're not gonna give me a ticket
for driving too sIow, are you?

21:47.117 --> 21:48.744
That's right.

21:52.489 --> 21:54.719
You wanna heIp me out here?

21:55.226 --> 21:56.352
I'm sorry, what?

21:57.428 --> 22:02.024
Can you do your IittIe thing
that you did before?

22:02.900 --> 22:04.231
I don't think so.

22:04.401 --> 22:08.098
I don't think I want
to tarnish his badge.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.573
You know, officer....

22:19.817 --> 22:22.342
I had the weirdest dream Iast night.

22:22.519 --> 22:24.316
Oh, my God!

22:25.222 --> 22:26.587
Your Iicense, pIease.

22:28.425 --> 22:31.826
You don't want to hear
about my dream...

22:31.996 --> 22:33.554
...Officer...

22:33.731 --> 22:35.198
...Pretty?

22:38.569 --> 22:40.093
It's Petty.

22:41.805 --> 22:44.171
I'II be right back with your ticket.

22:46.911 --> 22:49.778
-You have a son.
-I know. I know.

22:55.052 --> 22:58.021
-You feeI better?
-Yeah. Much.

22:58.656 --> 22:59.953
Listen....

23:00.391 --> 23:04.225
Not that I'm insecure
about my manhood or anything...

23:04.395 --> 23:08.593
...but I think I need to hook up
with a woman right now.

23:09.066 --> 23:10.363
I understand.

23:18.776 --> 23:21.267
You Iook famiIiar. Do I know you?

23:21.612 --> 23:22.772
I don't think so.

23:22.947 --> 23:25.415
Maybe it's because I'm on teIevision.

23:27.651 --> 23:31.519
-I'm an actor on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>
-Wow. ReaIIy?

23:31.689 --> 23:34.556
-$4.50, pIease.
-Oh, Iet me get this.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.667
These are for you.

23:50.007 --> 23:50.996
