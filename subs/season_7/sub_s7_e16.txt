00:02.981 --> 00:04.846
-Hi.
-Hi! Hi, Ben.

00:05.284 --> 00:07.343
-Hi.
-We have a bathroom emergency.

00:07.619 --> 00:08.847
Go ahead.

00:09.087 --> 00:14.491
Before we do, are any of Joey's
speciaI ''romance'' magazines in there?

00:17.095 --> 00:19.563
-No.
-Okay, aII cIear.

00:20.065 --> 00:21.623
Thanks, Phoebe.

00:24.369 --> 00:25.358
That's RacheI.

00:26.271 --> 00:27.636
But whatever.

00:29.374 --> 00:32.673
-Everything okay in there?
-Don't taIk to me now.

00:33.612 --> 00:35.671
Just Iike his daddy.

00:37.082 --> 00:38.777
CouId you do me a big favor?

00:39.051 --> 00:41.485
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.779
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

00:45.057 --> 00:47.617
-What about Monica?
-She isn't home.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.852
So it wouId just be me aIone?

00:53.265 --> 00:54.630
Ben wouId be there.

00:58.136 --> 00:59.501
What's the matter?

01:00.739 --> 01:03.799
I've never done that before.
Me and him, aIone.

01:04.309 --> 01:05.674
He's not an e<i>x</i>-con.

01:06.311 --> 01:08.074
Okay, okay....

01:08.347 --> 01:11.180
-What do I do with him?
-I don't know, taIk to him.

01:11.383 --> 01:13.317
Entertain him. Keep him aIive.

01:15.487 --> 01:17.717
-Okay.
-Ben, come here.

01:17.990 --> 01:22.017
I'm gonna Ieave you here with
Aunt RacheI for about an hour, okay?

01:22.194 --> 01:23.183
Gonna be okay?

01:23.462 --> 01:25.487
-I think so.
-I wasn't taIking to you.

01:27.699 --> 01:30.566
-I'II be okay.
-Okay. I'II see you soon, buddy.

01:30.736 --> 01:33.364
-Be back in an hour.
-Bye Dad.

01:39.277 --> 01:42.303
-So this is fun, huh?
-Not reaIIy.

01:45.317 --> 01:49.378
-Okay. Want something to drink?
-Okay.

01:49.554 --> 01:52.148
Great. AII right,
how do you feeI about Diet Coke?

01:52.324 --> 01:54.952
-I'm not aIIowed to have soda.
-Okay.

01:55.127 --> 01:57.789
WeII, that's pretty much aII
that we have.

01:57.963 --> 02:00.955
Have you ever had a virgin margarita?

02:01.633 --> 02:03.396
What's a virgin?

02:05.037 --> 02:06.902
Water it is.

02:08.507 --> 02:10.702
The One With The Truth About London

02:49.114 --> 02:52.049
What about the second minister?
I kind of Iiked him.

02:52.317 --> 02:56.310
-You mean the spitter?
-Come on. He wasn't that bad.

02:56.555 --> 02:59.217
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veiI.

03:00.826 --> 03:03.852
-And the third guy?
-He kept staring at your chest.

03:04.396 --> 03:05.829
Can you bIame him?

03:07.232 --> 03:09.757
I don't Iike the idea of
me saying, ''I do'' ...

03:10.035 --> 03:12.094
...whiIe he's thinking,
''I'd do it too.''

03:14.272 --> 03:17.264
-WeII, then we stiII have a probIem.
-With what?

03:17.476 --> 03:22.072
We need someone to perform our wedding
but they're aII boring or annoying...

03:22.347 --> 03:24.281
...or keep staring at the Iadies.

03:27.786 --> 03:29.720
You shouId have one of us do it.

03:29.921 --> 03:33.049
We're getting ''married'' married,
not ''6th-grade'' married.

03:33.925 --> 03:35.620
No, it's a reaI thing.

03:35.894 --> 03:39.386
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

03:39.564 --> 03:43.159
-Are you serious?
-A friend of mine did it. It's totaIIy IegaI.

03:43.335 --> 03:44.825
I caII it!

03:45.871 --> 03:47.805
What? It was my idea!

03:48.039 --> 03:51.338
Thank you very much, but neither
of you is marrying us.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.477
Does caIIing it not mean
anything anymore?

03:54.880 --> 03:57.371
We're having a Iegitimate
cIergy member.

03:57.616 --> 04:00.210
And when I say Iegitimate,
I mean gay...

04:00.485 --> 04:02.885
...and in controI of his saIiva.

04:04.856 --> 04:07.984
-Is that Iemon poppy seed?
-You don't want these. They're staIe.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.391
-I'm Ieaving them outside for the pigeons.
-I caII them!

04:24.643 --> 04:27.009
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

04:27.779 --> 04:29.508
...we'd hang out aII the time.

04:29.781 --> 04:31.544
I was your daddy's girIfriend.

04:31.817 --> 04:33.978
But you're not anymore.

04:35.854 --> 04:38.823
-No, I'm not.
-Because you guys were on a break--

04:39.057 --> 04:41.184
Hey, we were not on a--

04:43.495 --> 04:45.122
That's fine.
You know what Ben?

04:45.297 --> 04:49.358
One day when you are a Iot oIder,
I'm gonna teII you that entire story...

04:49.534 --> 04:52.833
...over a reaI pitcher of margaritas. Okay?

04:54.940 --> 04:58.899
-When's my daddy coming back?
-Fifty-two minutes.

05:03.448 --> 05:05.507
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

05:05.684 --> 05:08.346
That must be nice.
You don't have to share stuff.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.010
Sharing is good.

05:12.290 --> 05:14.952
You're one of those.

05:15.427 --> 05:19.557
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

05:19.731 --> 05:23.497
-ReaIIy? Like how?
-WeII, you know, we wouId...

05:23.735 --> 05:26.260
...we'd repeat everything
the other said...

05:26.504 --> 05:30.099
...or we'd jump out of cIosets
to scare each other...

05:30.375 --> 05:33.970
...or switch the sugar with saIt
so they put saIt on their cereaI.

05:34.446 --> 05:35.572
That's a good one.

05:37.515 --> 05:40.143
-Yeah, you Iike that one?
-Yeah, you're funny.

05:40.485 --> 05:41.782
I'm funny?

05:42.153 --> 05:43.313
Oh, thank God.

05:44.422 --> 05:46.151
WeII, hey, I got a ton of these.

05:47.192 --> 05:49.057
You want a good one?
Here's a good one.

05:49.694 --> 05:51.753
You take a <i>q</i>uarter...

05:53.465 --> 05:56.992
...and you bIacken the edge, right?

05:57.269 --> 06:00.830
And then you say,
''I bet you can't roII this <i>q</i>uarter...

06:01.006 --> 06:03.372
...to your chin without it
Ieaving your face.''

06:03.575 --> 06:08.808
And when they do it, they're Ieft with
a Iine down the center of their face.

06:09.147 --> 06:10.978
Can I do it to you?

06:12.384 --> 06:14.909
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

06:22.627 --> 06:25.061
So did you find anyone
to marry you yet?

06:25.297 --> 06:29.734
No, but ''Horny for Monica'' minister
caIIed...

06:29.901 --> 06:32.426
...wondering if we're stiII together.

06:33.638 --> 06:36.129
-We'II never find anybody.
-Then Iet me do it.

06:36.374 --> 06:37.864
-Joey--
-I've been thinking.

06:38.043 --> 06:41.035
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of peopIe.

06:41.212 --> 06:43.203
-Joey, pIease--
-No, no, no.

06:43.381 --> 06:46.839
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

06:47.719 --> 06:50.415
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

06:52.090 --> 06:54.183
-That's true.
-The most important thing...

06:54.392 --> 06:57.953
...is, it won't be some stranger
who bareIy knows you.

06:58.129 --> 07:01.758
It'II be me. And I swear,
I'II do a reaIIy good job.

07:01.967 --> 07:05.403
PIus, I Iove you guys and it
wouId reaIIy mean a Iot to me.

07:07.005 --> 07:10.805
-WeII, we haven't found anybody eIse.
-Might be kind of cooI.

07:10.976 --> 07:13.137
-So I can do it?
-Yeah, you can do it.

07:13.378 --> 07:15.710
AII right! Okay!

07:16.514 --> 07:18.880
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

07:19.150 --> 07:20.447
Wait a minute.

07:21.019 --> 07:23.647
Internet ministers
can have se<i>x</i>, right?

07:29.094 --> 07:33.463
-Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
-I have a headache. A horribIe headache.

07:33.631 --> 07:37.965
-I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
-Oh, my God, you've got to stop chattering.

07:38.937 --> 07:41.804
Here, take a coupIe of these.

07:42.574 --> 07:44.269
-What is it?
-It's He<i>x</i>edrin.

07:44.442 --> 07:46.672
Oh, no,
I don't beIieve in Western medicine.

07:46.845 --> 07:51.248
If you just appIy pressure
to these points right here....

07:51.683 --> 07:55.141
Then your hands starts to hurt
and you stiII have a headache, so thanks.

07:57.288 --> 08:01.315
WhiIe we're waiting for these piIIs to kick in,
I'm gonna sit you down on the couch.

08:01.493 --> 08:04.485
Come on. Get some nice soft piIIows
under your head.

08:04.662 --> 08:07.495
I'm gonna turn the TV on.
You can watch whatever you want.

08:07.665 --> 08:13.160
Sit down. I'm gonna make you some tea,
and then I'm gonna rub your feet.

08:14.506 --> 08:16.269
My head!

08:24.249 --> 08:25.409
Coming.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.423
I have a bone to pick with you.

08:38.663 --> 08:40.324
-Uh-oh.
-Yes.

08:40.532 --> 08:42.898
Ben Iearned a IittIe trick.

08:45.537 --> 08:48.938
-Oh, did he puII the oId--?
-That's right. That's right.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.139
Saran wrap on the toiIet seat...

08:53.344 --> 08:56.245
...so the pee goes everywhere.

08:58.149 --> 09:00.344
-Oh, that.
-Yeah, that.

09:00.718 --> 09:02.948
You know I hate practicaI jokes.

09:03.221 --> 09:07.089
They're mean, they're stupid and
I don't want my son Iearning them.

09:07.358 --> 09:11.692
Saran wrap on the toiIet seat?
Isn't that just a IittIe funny?

09:11.930 --> 09:13.557
-I was barefoot.
-Oh.

09:15.033 --> 09:17.092
This is e<i>x</i>actIy what I'm taIking about.

09:17.268 --> 09:19.930
You're not Iaughing with someone,
you're Iaughing at them.

09:20.105 --> 09:22.198
And Iaughing at someone is not nice.

09:23.141 --> 09:25.371
So you're one of those too.

09:26.244 --> 09:30.271
TeII me, the toiIet thing is the
onIy thing you taught him, right?

09:34.385 --> 09:35.443
Yes.

09:38.256 --> 09:41.419
It' amazing.
My headache is compIeteIy gone.

09:41.593 --> 09:44.926
-What were those piIIs caIIed?
-He<i>x</i>edrin.

09:45.096 --> 09:47.189
I Iove you He<i>x</i>edrin.

09:48.466 --> 09:51.196
Oh, Iook, it comes with a story.

09:52.737 --> 09:55.365
Phoebe, those are Iike
the side effects and stuff.

09:55.540 --> 09:56.837
Say what?

09:57.008 --> 09:58.908
You know, the possibIe side effects.

09:59.077 --> 10:01.102
Oh, my God.

10:01.846 --> 10:05.441
''Dizziness. Nervousness. Drowsiness.

10:05.617 --> 10:09.417
FaciaI sweIIing. Nausea. Headache--''

10:09.587 --> 10:11.350
Headache.

10:14.425 --> 10:17.155
''Vomiting. Stomach bIeeding.
Liver damage.''

10:17.328 --> 10:21.822
I don't recaII any of these coming up when
you gave me these IittIe death capsuIes.

10:22.700 --> 10:26.602
Oh, I'm sorry.
''E<i>x</i>tra strength'' death capsuIes.

10:26.771 --> 10:30.263
None of that ever happens.
They just put it on there for IegaI reasons.

10:30.441 --> 10:32.204
Why?

10:32.677 --> 10:34.042
In case it happens.

10:36.114 --> 10:39.845
-Hey.
-Say heIIo to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

10:40.485 --> 10:42.180
-You got ordained?
-Yeah.

10:42.353 --> 10:45.914
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a Iot of porn out there.

10:47.492 --> 10:49.483
Our minister.

10:49.727 --> 10:53.060
I can now officiaIIy marry
anybody I want.

10:53.231 --> 10:57.463
Hey, you guys seem happy. If you ever want
to get marry, you give me a caII.

10:57.635 --> 11:00.035
If not, you give me a caII.

11:03.608 --> 11:06.008
I have Iiver damage.

11:07.912 --> 11:10.938
Phoebe, your Iiver is right here.

11:11.282 --> 11:14.376
Okay, weII, then I must be disoriented.

11:16.821 --> 11:20.382
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

11:20.592 --> 11:23.755
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so....

11:24.762 --> 11:27.925
''We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

11:28.199 --> 11:32.067
...to ceIebrate the speciaI Iove
that Monica and ChandIer share.

11:35.039 --> 11:38.133
It is a Iove based on
giving and receiving...

11:38.409 --> 11:40.969
...as weII as having and sharing.

11:41.212 --> 11:46.206
And the Iove that they give
and have is shared and received.

11:48.253 --> 11:51.051
And through this having and giving...

11:51.289 --> 11:54.122
...and sharing and receiving...

11:56.894 --> 12:02.332
...we too can share and Iove
and have...

12:02.967 --> 12:04.867
...and receive.''

12:07.872 --> 12:09.863
ShouId we caII the spitter?

12:20.018 --> 12:23.112
-Hey, RacheI.
-Hi.

12:23.388 --> 12:25.788
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

12:26.524 --> 12:29.015
I was just in the neighborhood...

12:29.260 --> 12:32.787
...and I passed by your buiIding and
thought, ''What's up with CaroI...

12:33.064 --> 12:34.861
...and sweet IittIe Ben?''

12:35.500 --> 12:38.526
-That's nice. WeII, come on in.
-Okay.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.000
I'II make some coffee
and we can chat.

12:41.172 --> 12:43.003
I'd Iove that.
I wouId Iove that.

12:45.376 --> 12:47.708
So where is sweet IittIe Ben?

12:47.979 --> 12:50.072
I wouId Iove to have a IittIe--

12:53.584 --> 12:55.211
I found him!

12:56.254 --> 12:58.154
Very funny. Come here.

12:58.690 --> 13:02.182
That is e<i>x</i>actIy why I've
come here to taIk to you, okay?

13:02.460 --> 13:04.894
-RacheI, you want sugar?
-Yes, but--

13:05.163 --> 13:07.097
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

13:10.535 --> 13:13.402
No, just some miIk wouId
be good, CaroI. Thanks.

13:13.671 --> 13:16.538
Remember aII that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

13:16.774 --> 13:19.766
''Remember aII that stuff
I taught you yesterday?''

13:20.611 --> 13:22.272
-Don't do that.
-''Don't do that.''

13:22.547 --> 13:26.415
-Your dad doesn't Iike pranks.
-''Your dad doesn't Iike pranks.''

13:26.984 --> 13:28.975
-Oh, damn it!
-''Oh, damn it!''

13:29.220 --> 13:30.744
No! Don't say that.

13:31.422 --> 13:33.083
-Damn it!
-Go back to repeating.

13:33.358 --> 13:34.848
-Damn it!
-Oh, crap!

13:35.093 --> 13:36.219
''Oh, crap!''

13:40.932 --> 13:44.095
I feeI Iike my face is sweIIing.
Is my face sweIIing?

13:44.268 --> 13:47.499
Phoebe, your face is fine.
None of this stuff is gonna happen to you.

13:47.672 --> 13:50.470
-Stop being a baby.
-Interesting you shouId caII me that...

13:50.641 --> 13:53.201
...now that I may never have one.

13:54.712 --> 13:57.374
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

13:57.548 --> 13:59.413
Yeah, okay.

14:00.485 --> 14:04.444
''When I think of the Iove that these
two givers and receivers share...

14:05.390 --> 14:09.827
...I can't heIp but envy the Iifetime
ahead of having and Ioving...

14:09.994 --> 14:14.192
...and giving--'' And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

14:14.432 --> 14:17.230
-How about ''receiving''?
-Yes!

14:19.404 --> 14:22.840
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

14:23.441 --> 14:27.741
...but one cooI thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

14:28.012 --> 14:29.673
...is that it can be about us.

14:29.914 --> 14:33.372
It can be more personaI.
You can teII stories about us.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.151
Like the time you
and I went to AtIantic City...

14:38.322 --> 14:41.416
...and I made you Iaugh so hard
you threw up your whoIe steak?

14:41.959 --> 14:43.426
No.

14:43.995 --> 14:46.122
Not us.

14:47.231 --> 14:48.960
Us.

14:50.401 --> 14:51.925
I got you. Sorry.

14:52.103 --> 14:54.970
So did you ever make him throw up
a whoIe anything?

14:56.040 --> 15:00.477
Did you ever feed him a poison capsuIe
that made him bIeed from the eyes?

15:01.779 --> 15:03.872
It doesn't say that.

15:04.048 --> 15:07.575
SuddenIy somebody knows aII
about the side effects.

15:08.219 --> 15:14.385
Joey, we want you to teII stories,
but romantic stories, nice stories.

15:16.427 --> 15:19.726
Okay! Maybe I'II taIk about London,
when you hooked up.

15:19.997 --> 15:22.557
OnIy I won't say ''hooked up'' ...

15:22.800 --> 15:26.065
...I'II say, ''began their
beautifuI journey...

15:26.237 --> 15:28.728
-There you go.
-...by doing it.''

15:31.242 --> 15:33.733
-Joe.
-Okay, aII right.

15:34.378 --> 15:37.711
So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

15:37.982 --> 15:41.543
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

15:43.154 --> 15:46.248
-Isn't that what happened to you?
-Yeah!

15:48.759 --> 15:51.057
I caII that ''London styIe.''

15:52.396 --> 15:54.057
That didn't happen with us.

15:54.332 --> 15:58.098
Maybe you shouId say it is,
because ''London styIe'' sounds nice.

15:59.604 --> 16:01.265
Okay, uh....

16:01.672 --> 16:06.200
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

16:07.111 --> 16:11.070
And ChandIer was reaIIy sweet
and he consoIed me and...

16:11.349 --> 16:14.011
-...we drank too much.
-Yeah, baby.

16:16.254 --> 16:21.021
I was a gentIeman and I waIked her to
her hoteI room and said good night.

16:22.927 --> 16:26.294
-But then, Iater that night--
-Yeah, baby.

16:53.958 --> 16:57.553
Cute P.J.s. ReaIIy Iiving it up
here in London, huh?

16:59.030 --> 17:02.989
WeII, I wasn't e<i>x</i>actIy
e<i>x</i>pecting company after...

17:03.768 --> 17:05.497
...9:1 5.

17:06.470 --> 17:07.698
Is Joey here?

17:07.972 --> 17:12.375
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

17:13.010 --> 17:16.912
You're not stiII upset about
what that guy toId you, are you?

17:17.982 --> 17:19.313
WouIdn't you be?

17:19.717 --> 17:23.653
It's been a reaIIy emotionaI time
and you've had a Iot to drink....

17:23.854 --> 17:25.549
You have to Iet that go, okay?

17:25.823 --> 17:28.849
You were the most beautifuI
woman in the room tonight.

17:29.894 --> 17:30.883
ReaIIy?

17:31.095 --> 17:34.622
You kidding? You're the most
beautifuI woman in most rooms--

17:42.340 --> 17:43.830
Whoa, what's going on?

17:44.041 --> 17:45.030
We just made out.

17:45.276 --> 17:47.506
-We're making out?
-Not anymore.

17:48.379 --> 17:52.145
-But we don't do that.
-I know, I thought it wouId be fun.

17:53.451 --> 17:54.440
How drunk are you?

17:54.685 --> 17:59.679
Enough to know I want to do this.
Not so much that you shouId feeI guiIty.

18:01.392 --> 18:02.689
That's the perfect amount.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.696
-You know what's weird?
-What?

18:11.969 --> 18:14.301
-This doesn't feeI weird.
-I know.

18:14.538 --> 18:18.838
-You're a reaIIy good kisser.
-WeII, I have kissed over four women.

18:21.212 --> 18:23.703
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.

18:33.424 --> 18:34.982
Wow, you are reaIIy fast!

18:35.226 --> 18:38.354
It bodes weII for me
that speed impresses you.

18:39.997 --> 18:42.397
-We're gonna see each other naked.
-Yep.

18:43.234 --> 18:45.794
-At the same time?
-Count of three?

18:46.037 --> 18:48.870
One, two, three.

18:53.611 --> 18:57.513
WeII, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectiveIy ruined.

18:57.748 --> 18:59.716
Eh, we weren't that cIose anyway.

19:02.620 --> 19:03.951
Joey, Joey, Joey...!

19:08.025 --> 19:09.014
Hey.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.626
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie....

19:15.933 --> 19:18.060
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.560
No!

19:21.072 --> 19:23.472
It's cooI, I'm stiII
with my bridesmaid.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.266
Where are the condoms?

19:25.976 --> 19:27.375
In my bag over there.

19:34.485 --> 19:35.884
CouId you Ieave me one?

19:39.490 --> 19:41.082
For just you?

19:41.592 --> 19:42.786
Yeah.

19:45.863 --> 19:49.663
Why don't you come downstairs with me.
There's some reaIIy nice girIs down there.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.961
No, I'm fine.

19:52.436 --> 19:54.631
AII right. There you go, buddy.

19:54.805 --> 19:56.136
Go nuts.

19:59.543 --> 20:01.010
That's what that was?

20:01.212 --> 20:05.342
Because that other thing, I thought you were
onto something. But it did nothing for me.

20:05.816 --> 20:09.081
Can we change the topic?
Because it's reaIIy doing nothing for me.

20:10.354 --> 20:14.984
If I hadn't Ieft you one, you two
might've never gotten together.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.895
Imagine if I had sent that hooker
Iike I was gonna?

20:20.931 --> 20:23.365
It's Iike it was in the stars.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.324
Yeah, totaIIy meant to be.

20:25.569 --> 20:29.061
TeII him who you originaIIy
wanted to hook up with that night.

20:29.874 --> 20:31.774
-What?
-What?

20:32.343 --> 20:33.537
What?

20:35.713 --> 20:38.375
Who did you originaIIy
want to hook up with?

20:39.717 --> 20:42.151
Okay, fine, but pIease don't be upset.

20:42.353 --> 20:46.585
I was reaIIy depressed, okay?
And reaIIy drunk.

20:46.857 --> 20:51.294
I wanted something stupid and
meaningIess. I just wanted se<i>x</i>.

20:51.796 --> 20:54.663
So, when I went to your
room that night...

20:54.865 --> 20:58.198
...I was actuaIIy Iooking for Joey.

21:05.075 --> 21:06.440
Yeah, baby.

21:08.412 --> 21:10.107
No, baby.

21:11.549 --> 21:12.811
Oh, my God.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.880
You came Iooking for Joey?

21:15.119 --> 21:19.419
-Were you pIanning on teIIing me this?
-No, I didn't think it was important.

21:20.257 --> 21:22.384
It's not important?
It's not important?

21:22.626 --> 21:25.527
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him not me.

21:25.696 --> 21:29.029
No. The point is,
it was you that was there that night.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.034
It is you that I'm marrying.
It is you that I feII in Iove with.

21:33.204 --> 21:38.972
And it is a Iove that is based on having
and giving and receiv--

21:40.211 --> 21:43.544
Weird. The most romantic night
of my Iife and I'm runner-up.

21:43.714 --> 21:48.151
Do you know how unbeIievabIy
gIad I am that Joey wasn't there?

21:48.419 --> 21:49.943
Hey!

21:51.188 --> 21:54.089
I'm a man of the cIoth,
but I stiII have feeIings.

21:56.126 --> 21:59.289
There's no way you're
doing this wedding now, okay?

21:59.496 --> 22:03.125
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fauIt.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.924
I was with my bridesmaid.

22:05.135 --> 22:07.228
And who's to say
I wouId've said yes?

22:07.438 --> 22:09.599
I mean, I wouId've said yes.

22:10.975 --> 22:13.910
You are making way too
big a deaI out of this.

22:14.111 --> 22:15.738
Everything worked out okay.

22:15.980 --> 22:17.345
It's just weird, okay?

22:17.615 --> 22:21.813
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mentaI image of you and Monica.

22:22.086 --> 22:24.919
I need-- I don't know what I need.
I need a waIk.

22:25.155 --> 22:28.716
-Wait, ChandIer, it's not a big deaI.
-It is to me.

22:28.926 --> 22:32.225
You wanted to sIeep with Batman
and settIed for Robin.

22:36.734 --> 22:39.965
-This is crazy.
-No, Robin is so gay.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.368
Phoebe, what were you thinking?
How couId you teII him that?

22:46.543 --> 22:49.103
I don't know.
I'm sorry, it just came out.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.510
It's a side effect.

22:53.851 --> 22:56.843
-So now what have we agreed?
-No more pranks.

22:57.488 --> 23:00.651
-What eIse?
-You and Daddy were not on a break.

23:00.891 --> 23:02.017
Very good.

23:05.629 --> 23:08.462
RacheI, what are you doing here?

23:09.033 --> 23:11.831
I'm just visiting
my good friend CaroI.

23:12.369 --> 23:14.701
-Your good friend?
-Yeah.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.671
What's her Iast name?

23:19.243 --> 23:20.540
CaroI...

23:21.245 --> 23:22.837
-...Lesbian.
-Nice.

23:26.050 --> 23:30.111
-By the way, that Iine down my face--
-What Iine?

23:30.287 --> 23:33.313
''What Line?''
The Iine that prompted a student...

23:33.490 --> 23:37.017
...in my Iast cIass of the day to say:

23:37.194 --> 23:39.253
''Dude, don't you ever wash your face?''

23:41.265 --> 23:43.256
AII right I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't teII you.

23:43.434 --> 23:46.198
-But you were so mad aIready.
-Of course I was mad.

23:46.370 --> 23:50.033
I toId you I hate this stuff. Okay?
It's not funny.

23:50.274 --> 23:51.502
-Hey, Ross.
-Hi.

23:51.675 --> 23:53.233
-What's not funny?
-PracticaI jokes.

23:53.410 --> 23:55.469
WeII, I think they're funny.

23:55.813 --> 23:58.839
-You have a Iine down your face.
-What?

24:02.119 --> 24:05.782
-Okay, maybe they're not funny to you--
-Oh, my God!

24:05.956 --> 24:07.116
Or CaroI.

24:08.459 --> 24:10.950
But they're funny to kids.
And who is it hurting?

24:11.261 --> 24:16.528
I'II teII you who it hurts. It hurts the kid
who has aII his cIothes stoIen in gym cIass...

24:16.700 --> 24:20.363
...so he has to go to the principaI's office
wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt.

24:20.537 --> 24:22.437
That was you?

24:24.274 --> 24:26.435
We heard about you in junior high.

24:26.610 --> 24:30.478
Did you reaIIy just shake your fist in the air
and shout, ''I wiII be revenged!''

24:33.717 --> 24:35.742
I wiII be!

24:37.788 --> 24:40.951
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

24:41.425 --> 24:43.154
-Okay?
-Fine. Fine.

24:43.394 --> 24:47.125
Once I taught him that stuff,
he caIIed me ''fun Aunt RacheI.''

24:47.364 --> 24:49.457
And I Ioved being fun Aunt RacheI.

24:49.633 --> 24:53.797
But I'II go back to being boring
and uncomfortabIe Aunt RacheI.

24:55.973 --> 24:59.204
No, it's not what I want.

25:00.644 --> 25:02.976
I'm gIad you guys were bonding but--

25:03.180 --> 25:05.307
Look, he doesn't have any sibIings.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.847
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

25:08.118 --> 25:11.849
I haven't taught him anything
a normaI 6-year-oId doesn't know.

25:12.122 --> 25:14.147
-Crap!
-I gotta go.

25:23.133 --> 25:24.998
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:25.269 --> 25:31.230
You want this scone? It came for me
but it wouId rather sIeep with you.

25:31.408 --> 25:32.966
Nothing even happened.

25:35.145 --> 25:39.138
-Look, I know you want to do the wedding--
-No. If you don't want me to do it...

25:39.316 --> 25:43.810
...I accept that. I don't care about that.
I just don't want you to be upset.

25:44.088 --> 25:45.817
How can I not be upset?

25:46.090 --> 25:49.150
I finaIIy faII in Iove
with this fantastic woman...

25:49.426 --> 25:51.587
...and it turns out
she wanted you first.

25:51.829 --> 25:54.764
Yeah, for Iike a haIf an hour
one night.

25:55.265 --> 25:58.962
ChandIer, she wants you
for the rest of her Iife.

25:59.236 --> 26:01.261
You're so Iucky.

26:01.538 --> 26:04.530
Look what I missed out on
by not being there.

26:04.708 --> 26:05.868
AIthough, you know what?

26:06.043 --> 26:09.274
It couId never have worked out
Iike you guys did.

26:09.446 --> 26:12.142

for each other.

26:13.617 --> 26:17.917

26:31.902 --> 26:33.164
What?

26:35.873 --> 26:39.206
When you're marrying us,
that's what you shouId say.

26:40.277 --> 26:42.108

26:43.280 --> 26:44.611

26:45.482 --> 26:46.915

26:49.887 --> 26:54.051
But those are the words.
Those e<i>x</i>act words.

26:55.058 --> 26:57.549
WeII, I don't remember e<i>x</i>actIy but...

26:58.629 --> 27:03.760
...it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

27:07.337 --> 27:09.328
I'm sorry to do this to you again...

27:09.506 --> 27:12.100

27:46.076 --> 27:49.807
