WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.398
Oh, hey, you guys?

00:02.572 --> 00:05.372
I couldn't get a reservation
for the night of my birthday..

00:05.578 --> 00:07.707
so we'll have to do dinner
Thursday night.

00:07.916 --> 00:12.824
- Thursday? But that's Halloween.
- So?

00:13.226 --> 00:15.321
It's just spooky, that's all.

00:16.332 --> 00:18.097
So, is Mike coming to dinner?

00:18.303 --> 00:22.073
No. It's my first birthday
with a boyfriend, and he has to work.

00:22.244 --> 00:26.275
I'd get mad at him, but I think
it's too soon to show my true colors.

00:28.023 --> 00:31.519
I would make the reservation for five.
One of us has to stay with Emma.

00:31.697 --> 00:33.792
- Which one of us should go to dinner?
- Rachel!

00:36.172 --> 00:40.237
Actually, I was thinking
maybe both of us could go.

00:43.286 --> 00:46.053
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought
into your gift.

00:47.461 --> 00:49.659
All right, so great, we can all go now.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.303
That is fun! Hey! You know what?

00:52.471 --> 00:56.172
We all haven't been together,
the six of us, in such a long time.

00:56.379 --> 00:58.577
What are you talking about?
We're together now.

00:58.818 --> 01:01.380
Mon? Chandler's not here.

01:05.097 --> 01:06.532
Oh, dear God.

01:55.932 --> 01:58.904
Hello. It's nice to see
our team together for the first time.

01:59.071 --> 02:02.475
Now, before we get started,
are there any questions?

02:02.679 --> 02:04.409
- Yes. Ken, is it?
- That's right.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.953
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,
you fell asleep in a meeting..

02:08.123 --> 02:11.722
and took the job without realizing
what you were saying yes to?

02:13.133 --> 02:16.196
Well, don't believe
everything you hear, Ken.

02:16.372 --> 02:17.932
But yeah, that's true.

02:19.311 --> 02:24.653
All right, let's get started by taking
a look at last quarter's figures.

02:25.825 --> 02:30.163
Claudia, aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

02:30.868 --> 02:36.710
- I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
- No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.316
Right now, I can't remember why.

02:39.986 --> 02:42.320
You're not allowed to smoke
in this office, right?

02:42.525 --> 02:46.089
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke
in offices with 15 people or less.

02:46.265 --> 02:49.499
- Would you like one?
- Would Joey like two pizzas?

02:52.277 --> 02:54.440
You don't know what I'm talking about.

02:55.016 --> 02:56.883
All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.354
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead, it's fine.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.168
So, you all smoke, then?

03:06.339 --> 03:09.402
You know, it's almost rude
that I'm not smoking.

03:09.646 --> 03:12.014
- That's not true. If you don't want..
- Ken, please!

03:15.323 --> 03:18.386
No, I can't. I can't smoke.
If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.863
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?

03:22.939 --> 03:25.877
I've always liked you, Ken.

03:31.255 --> 03:34.022
Trick or treat.

03:35.564 --> 03:37.430
- Hey.
- And "treat" it is.

03:40.206 --> 03:42.438
Wow. So glad I changed.

03:43.046 --> 03:46.816
I almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.

03:49.091 --> 03:51.186
This is not what I'm wearing.
I'm ovulating..

03:51.362 --> 03:54.767
and Chandler's gonna be home. So,
I thought we would try before dinner.

03:56.238 --> 03:58.003
Oh, I thought we'd all
go over together.

03:58.176 --> 04:00.739
All right, I'll just meet you there
at dinner.

04:00.915 --> 04:05.584
Unless, I mean, if it helps,
I could stay and watch.

04:07.027 --> 04:09.429
- No!
- Well, I didn't want to anyway.

04:09.599 --> 04:13.129
You know, just thought
I'd be polite and offer.

04:15.043 --> 04:16.774
Wait, does this mean you'll be late?

04:16.947 --> 04:18.849
We haven't seen each other
in over a week.

04:19.018 --> 04:20.851
We'll probably be the first ones there.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.824
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

04:26.265 --> 04:27.700
Hey. Well, hey!

04:28.136 --> 04:31.267
Wow, somebody smoked out here?

04:33.413 --> 04:36.909
My God, don't people know you're
not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

04:37.154 --> 04:43.292
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal
in offices with fewer than 15 people.

04:43.499 --> 04:45.298
Oh, you smoked.

04:45.504 --> 04:50.241
No. I just happen to know a lot of trivia
about smoking in different states.

04:50.413 --> 04:55.014
For example, in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called lei-lana-lukus.

04:56.392 --> 05:00.925
- Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!
- Do you think Monica will smell it?

05:01.135 --> 05:04.631
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bloodhound.

05:04.843 --> 05:08.247
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

05:11.656 --> 05:13.785
Phoebe?

05:14.461 --> 05:16.591
I'm gonna go.

05:20.273 --> 05:23.769
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

05:26.987 --> 05:29.321
Oven cleaner.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.404
Unscented.

05:38.042 --> 05:39.534
Welcome home.

05:41.348 --> 05:43.546
I've missed you.

05:43.720 --> 05:48.286
- You want to join me in the bedroom?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

05:48.797 --> 05:53.170
Okay. So you want to play it
that way, do you?

05:53.507 --> 05:56.069
Well, you know what, actually,
I just got off a plane..

05:56.312 --> 05:58.579
so I'm feeling gross.
I should take a shower.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.552
- Come here, you don't need a shower.
- All right, the truth is..

06:02.725 --> 06:05.595
I soiled myself
during some turbulence.

06:09.471 --> 06:12.672
What do I smell? I smell smoke.

06:12.845 --> 06:15.008
Did you smoke?

06:15.183 --> 06:18.053
Yes. But I just had one.

06:18.222 --> 06:19.691
Two.

06:19.859 --> 06:22.592
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.207
A pack. Two pack.. A carton.

06:28.376 --> 06:30.870
Three big fat cartons in two days!

06:32.652 --> 06:35.647
But it's over. I've made a decision,
I'm not gonna smoke anymore.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.467
Well, those are for you.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.244
All right. Well, we'll just see you
when you get here. Bye.

06:48.115 --> 06:51.053
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terrible traffic.

06:51.255 --> 06:53.988
That is now the third sign
that I should not leave Emma.

06:54.194 --> 06:57.223
- What are the other two?
- Well, the first one is, I don't want to.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.862
And second one, I'm not going.

07:01.108 --> 07:03.636
I know this is the first time
we're leaving the baby.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.841
I know how hard it is for you. But..

07:06.018 --> 07:09.149
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

07:09.324 --> 07:11.487
- She's great with kids.
- She is?

07:11.663 --> 07:13.792
Yeah.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.536
What about Monica?

07:15.738 --> 07:19.838
You only hear Monica's side of that.
Okay, that little fatso was a terror!

07:22.651 --> 07:27.217
- I just don't think I can do it.
- Know what? You can and you should.

07:27.427 --> 07:29.397
Really, it will be good for you.

07:29.565 --> 07:31.033
In fact, you know what?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.866
Go ahead to the restaurant,
and I will wait for my mom..

07:34.040 --> 07:37.741
and then I'll meet you there.
No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

07:37.915 --> 07:44.451
Really, the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!

07:45.296 --> 07:49.704
- You need to learn some new slang.
- I'm serious. Come on, you should go.

07:49.906 --> 07:52.742
Here. No, just go.

07:52.912 --> 07:54.882
- Well..
- No, no! You know what?

07:55.049 --> 07:59.046
You're not getting back in there!
The baby's fine. Now, scram!

08:00.226 --> 08:01.991
Yeah, hit the bricks!

08:03.733 --> 08:05.999
Tell your story walking!

08:07.508 --> 08:10.206
I was just going to say
that I left my keys.

08:13.820 --> 08:17.088
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now!

08:20.634 --> 08:23.970
Where is everyone?
They're 40 minutes late.

08:24.207 --> 08:26.143
- I know.
- I'm starving.

08:26.345 --> 08:29.010
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I ate nothing all day.

08:29.251 --> 08:31.346
What about me?
I only had one lunch today.

08:33.158 --> 08:36.028
So, are we expecting
the rest of our party shortly?

08:36.265 --> 08:38.600
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah.

08:38.770 --> 08:42.368
Their arrival is in the offing.

08:42.811 --> 08:44.838
Right. We have a table for two available.

08:45.016 --> 08:46.679
- Perhaps you'd..
- No, they're coming.

08:46.853 --> 08:48.344
We're waiting right here.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.284
Joseph!

08:52.865 --> 08:55.996
One needn't worry.
They shan't be long.

08:56.338 --> 08:59.778
It's just that we do have
some large parties waiting.

08:59.979 --> 09:02.883
Oh, one really does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?

09:06.491 --> 09:09.794
Why would you start smoking again?
It's so bad for you.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.701
It's only been two days.
That's not enough time to..

09:15.844 --> 09:17.677
That's totally unrelated.

09:18.783 --> 09:21.914
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?

09:22.156 --> 09:25.926
Where the little kid walks
through Grandpa? It's chilling!

09:26.098 --> 09:28.934
I messed up. It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.

09:29.137 --> 09:31.266
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

09:31.475 --> 09:34.379
Willpower? I've watched home movies
of you eating Ding Dongs..

09:34.548 --> 09:36.380
without taking the tinfoil off!

09:38.657 --> 09:41.059
You said that was sexy!

09:42.898 --> 09:46.496
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.200
That's right, because I forbid you
to smoke again.

09:49.411 --> 09:51.404
You forbid me?

09:51.649 --> 09:53.881
I've flown a long way
to see my loving wife.

09:54.054 --> 09:55.990
Is she here, by the way?

09:56.191 --> 10:02.158
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.

10:02.370 --> 10:05.365
- Is this the most upset you could be?
- I think so.

10:05.577 --> 10:07.672
Well, then I might as well..

10:07.881 --> 10:09.942
do this.

10:20.039 --> 10:22.772
Not really sure what to do now.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.574
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

10:26.753 --> 10:29.315
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.

10:29.491 --> 10:31.484
So you're going to put out
that cigarette..

10:31.662 --> 10:34.428
we're gonna put this fight on hold,
and go have sex.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.628
Fine. What?

10:37.674 --> 10:40.270
What, do you have
cigarettes in your ears?

10:41.014 --> 10:43.850
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it..

10:44.020 --> 10:46.183
we're gonna have to wait
until next month!

10:46.859 --> 10:48.852
You're serious?

10:49.030 --> 10:52.526
- Oh, yeah!
- All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking!

10:52.771 --> 10:55.709
- And no cuddling.
- And no kissing your neck.

10:55.911 --> 10:59.372
Oh, good! I hate it when you do that!

11:01.121 --> 11:04.321
And lots of kissing your neck!

11:05.262 --> 11:06.959
Okay, well, the super's not home.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.730
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.

11:09.905 --> 11:13.173
I can't wait that long. You have to do
something. Knock that door down!

11:13.345 --> 11:15.543
I would, but I bruise like a peach.

11:17.955 --> 11:21.861
Besides, you know, everything's
gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

11:22.096 --> 11:26.298
- What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
- Can't hold her head up, but jumped.

11:27.373 --> 11:29.309
Oh, my God!
I left the water running!

11:29.477 --> 11:33.349
You did not leave the water running.
Please, pull yourself together, okay?

11:33.586 --> 11:37.856
- Well, did I leave the stove on?
- You haven't cooked since 1996.

11:38.362 --> 11:41.824
Is the window open? If the window's
open a bird could fly in and..

11:42.003 --> 11:44.030
My God, you know what?
I think you're right.

11:44.207 --> 11:45.506
- Listen.
- What? What?

11:45.677 --> 11:50.118
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.
An eagle flew in!

11:51.254 --> 11:54.192
Landed on the stove and caught fire!

11:56.398 --> 12:02.343
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

12:02.511 --> 12:05.448
The eagle, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression..

12:05.650 --> 12:07.346
and grabs the baby in its talon.

12:07.521 --> 12:10.755
Meanwhile, the faucet
fills the apartment with water.

12:10.927 --> 12:14.422
Baby and bird, still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip..

12:14.601 --> 12:19.440
swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment!

12:20.981 --> 12:23.315
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.

12:27.961 --> 12:29.692
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:29.898 --> 12:31.800
It's been an hour.

12:31.969 --> 12:35.966
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider
switching to a smaller table.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.769
Maybe we should just eat now.

12:37.948 --> 12:41.581
You can't order until the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant policy.

12:41.789 --> 12:44.693
Well, how about this?
Another table leaves, right..

12:44.862 --> 12:47.925
but there's still some food left
on their plates.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.541
Okay, what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?

12:51.776 --> 12:54.680
- It's frowned upon.
- But it happens.

12:58.221 --> 13:00.749
- All right, I got to go to the bathroom.
- You can't go.

13:00.927 --> 13:03.124
No, no, no.
I can't hold this table on my own.

13:03.298 --> 13:05.325
If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

13:05.537 --> 13:07.507
Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.

13:13.653 --> 13:16.146
Good evening, miss.

13:17.026 --> 13:19.053
Miss?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.435
Miss? Miss?

13:23.606 --> 13:28.206
Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.
You don't have to manhandle me.

13:29.217 --> 13:32.713
- Where?
- Okay.

13:33.225 --> 13:36.493
Thank you. Wow.

13:36.665 --> 13:38.567
Will you stop staring at us now?

13:38.736 --> 13:43.109
That depends. Will your friend stop
drinking olive oil directly from the bottle?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.441
Probably not.

13:52.463 --> 13:55.299
Finally. You guys made it.

14:02.316 --> 14:03.649
Phoebe, who the hell..?

14:15.175 --> 14:18.580
What is taking you so long,
Come on, let's get it over with!

14:19.150 --> 14:21.120
In a minute, sweet cakes.

14:21.755 --> 14:25.194
Spend more time with the tie!
That will make a baby.

14:25.997 --> 14:30.301
Look, I can't do this. I can't make love
to you while we're fighting this way.

14:30.506 --> 14:32.806
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

14:32.978 --> 14:35.643
But when you wanted to have sex
after my uncle's funeral..

14:35.850 --> 14:37.945
That was a celebration of life!

14:39.457 --> 14:41.256
All right, I'm not gonna do this.

14:41.461 --> 14:43.955
Is this the way you want our baby
to be conceived?

14:45.369 --> 14:47.863
No, you're right.

14:48.341 --> 14:50.311
We shouldn't do it like this.

14:53.485 --> 14:56.184
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

14:56.357 --> 14:59.660
I shouldn't have come down on you
so hard about the smoking.

14:59.965 --> 15:03.837
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.637
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:07.046 --> 15:09.141
You are incredible.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.845
And listen,
I'm not gonna smoke again.

15:12.022 --> 15:15.085
And if I do, I promise
I will hide it so much better from you.

15:27.086 --> 15:28.555
- Want to?
- Let's celebrate life!

15:28.723 --> 15:30.852
Okay!

15:32.429 --> 15:34.559
Oh, God.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.637
Oh, thank God you're okay.

15:36.839 --> 15:39.309
I'm sorry we left.
Mommy will never leave you again.

15:39.477 --> 15:42.507
Never, ever, ever again.

15:42.884 --> 15:44.547
Great. So let's get going.

15:46.090 --> 15:49.392
I mean it. After what just happened,
I'm never leaving her again.

15:49.598 --> 15:52.364
I understand. Separation is hard.

15:52.537 --> 15:56.534
One time I was about to leave Ross
to go to the beauty parlor.

15:56.712 --> 15:59.444
And he got so upset
he took off all his clothes..

15:59.618 --> 16:02.886
tucked his willy between his legs..

16:03.057 --> 16:07.897
and cried out, "Mommy, I'm a girl.
Take me with you."

16:15.550 --> 16:19.820
Somehow, over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.

16:24.968 --> 16:27.940
You are welcome.

16:29.143 --> 16:32.343
- You know what? Let's not talk.
- What?

16:32.584 --> 16:36.023
- I am still so mad at you for smoking!
- But you said you forgave me.

16:36.190 --> 16:39.162
It was just a couple of cigarettes,
no big deal.

16:41.133 --> 16:45.666
I was ovulating and you said you
wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.

16:46.578 --> 16:52.283
- You tricked me to get me into bed?
- That's right. I got mine.

16:54.794 --> 16:57.630
I feel so used.

16:58.969 --> 17:02.373
Well, I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?

17:03.111 --> 17:05.104
Thank you.

17:08.488 --> 17:11.859
Waiter? All right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.

17:12.062 --> 17:14.328
Risotto with shaved truffles
and the rib steak..

17:14.501 --> 17:17.199
with the golden chanterelles
and the Bordelaise sauce..

17:17.372 --> 17:20.539
unless any of that stuff I just said
means "snails."

17:20.880 --> 17:22.782
It does not.

17:22.951 --> 17:26.412
Tomato tart, and which of the pastas
would you recommend?

17:26.592 --> 17:29.392
- Oh, well they're both exquisite..
- Both it is. Thank you.

17:29.564 --> 17:34.130
Now, let's go, baby.
It's food time. Bring it, bitch.

17:37.714 --> 17:41.084
- Sorry about that.
- It's quite all right.

17:41.287 --> 17:43.314
Oh, can I make a special request?

17:43.491 --> 17:45.358
Can you bring everything
as it's ready?

17:45.529 --> 17:47.965
- Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
- Hey!

17:50.138 --> 17:53.008
- I'll wait to put your order in.
- What did I ever do to you?

17:53.177 --> 17:55.272
Nothing, bitch.

17:59.557 --> 18:01.458
You guys are over an hour late.

18:01.628 --> 18:03.791
- What happened to you two?
- So sorry.

18:03.966 --> 18:07.370
- We got locked out of the apartment.
- That's a great story. Can I eat it?

18:08.408 --> 18:11.312
And then Rachel wasn't sure
she could leave the baby.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.942
It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday
and I did what I had to do.

18:15.221 --> 18:17.624
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?

18:21.467 --> 18:24.496
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma..

18:24.674 --> 18:28.306
how she's doing at home, and I'm
gonna be completely here with you.

18:28.515 --> 18:30.313
- Oh, she spit up. She spit up.
- What?

18:30.485 --> 18:33.184
Judy? She spit..
Judy, look alive, Judy!

18:36.531 --> 18:39.024
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:41.006 --> 18:43.876
Oh, everything looks delicious.

18:44.046 --> 18:47.850
What should I have?
What should I have?

18:48.020 --> 18:51.926
Never hit a woman.
Never hit a woman.

18:52.429 --> 18:54.456
I know what you mean,
this menu's incredible.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.571
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.

18:58.709 --> 19:00.975
Okay, I'll have the fig salad
and the duck.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.979
I'll have the soup and the salmon.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.154
Remember, whatever comes up first,
okay?

19:05.321 --> 19:06.722
- Hurry..
- Happy birthday!

19:06.892 --> 19:08.121
Son of a bitch!

19:09.363 --> 19:12.460
- Where have you been?
- Well, we had a little fight.

19:12.637 --> 19:14.630
I would never lie
to get someone into bed.

19:14.808 --> 19:18.406
You used to tell girls
you were a Kennedy.

19:20.519 --> 19:22.420
Thanks.

19:23.926 --> 19:26.693
Thanks. Wow.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.735
A little tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?

19:32.075 --> 19:35.138
You had a big table
but they made you move.

19:35.315 --> 19:36.784
Shut up, Monica.

19:38.989 --> 19:42.952
Oh, well, I suppose that Chandler
will have the smoked duck.

19:44.299 --> 19:49.469
And I suppose that Monica
will have the manipulative shrew.

19:50.278 --> 19:52.511
How did I miss that?

19:53.518 --> 19:56.011
- I'll give you another minute.
- What, where you going?

19:56.223 --> 19:58.854
He said she wanted the shrew!

20:00.031 --> 20:01.830
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

20:02.035 --> 20:06.203
You're turning into an obsessive
mother, okay? You need to stop.

20:06.811 --> 20:11.617
You ever hear the story about when
Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?

20:12.890 --> 20:17.832
- You mean the willy story?
- They already know it.

20:21.574 --> 20:23.703
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

20:23.879 --> 20:25.370
- You should order.
- That's okay.

20:25.549 --> 20:28.418
- I told the waiter what they want.
- Why would you do that?

20:28.655 --> 20:30.955
Chandler, control your woman.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.357
Okay, well..
Everybody has ordered.

20:34.534 --> 20:41.207
I would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.

20:41.380 --> 20:44.751
- She dropped her sock.
- What?

20:45.388 --> 20:47.518
No. No, Emma dropped her sock.

20:47.693 --> 20:49.184
- How do you know that?
- She's over there.

20:49.363 --> 20:51.732
- Mom's with her.
- Mom's here?

20:52.135 --> 20:56.371
I wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.

20:56.544 --> 20:59.573
She still has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.

20:59.784 --> 21:02.084
It's a good toast.

21:02.288 --> 21:04.919
Look, will you please get her attention?

21:05.763 --> 21:08.063
Mommy?

21:12.375 --> 21:14.242
Mother.

21:22.062 --> 21:24.123
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
pick up the sock!

21:24.332 --> 21:27.395
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

21:31.848 --> 21:33.841
I'm sorry, was that rude?

21:35.154 --> 21:37.955
Did my little outburst..

21:38.160 --> 21:42.328
blunt the hideousness
that is this evening?

21:42.570 --> 21:44.436
Look, I know you have a lot going on..

21:44.607 --> 21:50.518
but all I wanted to do was have
dinner with my friends on my birthday.

21:50.686 --> 21:56.220
And you are all so late, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to call.

21:57.298 --> 22:00.601
Well, it's too late now.

22:00.973 --> 22:02.498
Phoebe, I don't think that's us.

22:04.146 --> 22:08.177
Oh, well, this is.. This is not over!
Hello?

22:10.158 --> 22:14.360
I feel terrible. We should've been strong
and left Emma at home.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.866
"We"?

22:16.036 --> 22:18.837
There are some adult willy stories
they don't know.

22:19.009 --> 22:21.479
We should've been stronger.

22:21.915 --> 22:25.719
- What is going on with you two?
- Well, you see, I'm ovulating.

22:25.889 --> 22:28.520
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

22:29.864 --> 22:34.328
Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybe
it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

22:35.007 --> 22:39.175
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.
I just can't get enough.

22:39.850 --> 22:41.547
You're not gonna believe this.

22:41.721 --> 22:44.055
She tricked me
into having sex with her.

22:47.566 --> 22:50.766
So? You got to have sex, right?

22:51.240 --> 22:54.771
What's the matter with me?
Why am I such a girl?

22:56.049 --> 22:59.385
- Okay. That was Mike.
- Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

22:59.557 --> 23:02.757
You are totally right.
We are here 100 percent..

23:02.930 --> 23:06.300
and we love you, and we are ready
to start your birthday celebration.

23:06.504 --> 23:09.670
You guys, that means the world to me.

23:12.816 --> 23:14.284
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

23:16.290 --> 23:17.520
What?

23:17.760 --> 23:20.128
I love you guys too, but,
Mike got off work early.

23:20.298 --> 23:22.131
Wait.

23:23.270 --> 23:26.835
I'm not the.. I'm not the kind of girl
that just ditches her friends..

23:27.011 --> 23:29.277
to be with her boyfriend.

23:29.482 --> 23:30.781
You know what? I am.

23:31.688 --> 23:34.181
Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.

23:36.564 --> 23:38.362
If Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?

23:38.535 --> 23:42.635
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.

23:42.810 --> 23:44.039
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

23:44.212 --> 23:48.482
See you. Well, I guess it's just us.

23:51.661 --> 23:56.068
So, I'm probably still ovulating.
Do you want to give it another try?

23:56.971 --> 23:58.600
All right.

23:58.775 --> 24:01.975
So, you've never had sex
with a Kennedy, have you?

24:03.417 --> 24:06.686
Actually, Richard was a Kennedy
on his mother's side.

24:06.858 --> 24:09.625
Why did you break up with that guy?

24:09.897 --> 24:12.129
- You're gonna go do it?
- We don't have much time.

24:12.301 --> 24:14.464
Once the egg descends
into the fallopian tube..

24:14.640 --> 24:16.472
Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!

24:20.819 --> 24:24.189
I sincerely hope the rest of your party
is returning.

24:24.392 --> 24:26.727
No, just me. All alone.

24:31.239 --> 24:34.211
Dinner for six for one.

24:34.747 --> 24:38.208
Well, you boys are about
to see something really special.

24:51.313 --> 24:52.839
- How was everything?
- Excellent.

24:53.016 --> 24:56.455
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

24:57.593 --> 24:59.221
I hope you've got some room left.

25:07.813 --> 25:09.042
Joey. Joey.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.824
This is the best birthday ever!
