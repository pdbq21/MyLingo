WEBVTT

00:03.603 --> 00:06.470
-Good! You guys are all here.
-What's up?

00:06.740 --> 00:09.732
I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.

00:10.276 --> 00:11.766
Congratulations!

00:11.978 --> 00:14.811
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!

00:15.415 --> 00:18.407
-What?
-Well, I got this pair marked "XS."

00:18.718 --> 00:22.449
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.447
I'll be the coordinator
of the women's collection.

00:25.658 --> 00:29.924
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me!

00:30.130 --> 00:32.394
If you nail the interview,
you'll get it.

00:32.632 --> 00:35.066
You want to work
on your interview skills?

00:36.102 --> 00:38.161
Let's start with the handshake.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.437
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.476
Let me try.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.445
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?

00:49.682 --> 00:51.013
Did I squeeze too hard?

00:51.418 --> 00:54.649
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.152
The One with Rachel's lnadvertent Kiss

01:45.238 --> 01:48.571
That's right, Ross.
I can see you in your new apartment.

01:48.842 --> 01:52.300
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.541
Is he doing
his "shark attack" bit?

01:54.814 --> 01:57.476
No. Oh, wait!
There he goes.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.395
Very funny, Ross.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.499
Very lifelike and funny.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.930
No, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.342
Whoa, maybe I was.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.212
This hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.681
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!

02:34.420 --> 02:36.445
Yeah, I'm down with that.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.252
Okay, here goes.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.093
How...

02:43.463 --> 02:44.896
...you...

02:45.565 --> 02:47.362
...doing?

02:49.769 --> 02:53.205
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.703
Let's see,
she's on the third floor....

02:57.443 --> 03:00.708
-She is pretty, huh?
-Tell me about it.

03:01.981 --> 03:03.949
No, no! I'm not with her.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.913
That's just Monica.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.365
Hey, Joey!

03:26.639 --> 03:28.869
Great stuff, huh?

03:29.609 --> 03:30.803
This your place?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.410
Yeah, of course it is.
Come on in.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.980
Go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.643
I counted.
You're not supposed to live here!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.219
Oh, man!

03:49.028 --> 03:50.017
What happened?

03:50.196 --> 03:53.962
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.397
Damn! She's not there anymore.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.936
Look, Ross is doing
his "watching TV" bit.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.403
No, Joe, I think
he's just watching TV.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.584
We've lost visual contact
with the suspect.

04:19.792 --> 04:22.317
Okay, now I really have to go.

04:22.662 --> 04:25.495
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

04:25.698 --> 04:28.496
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.669
-I know, but it's my job.
-Then maybe I could come too.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.773
Suspect has just emerged
naked from the sewer.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.636
All right, you go.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.814
-Oh, God!
-What?

04:49.989 --> 04:52.014
Oh, I just miss him so much!

04:56.729 --> 04:58.629
For just a week,
you guys are close.

04:58.865 --> 05:02.062
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it. He's so sweet.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.896
He's like this little
puppy dog, you know?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.972
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.872
I love the beginning parts
of relationships.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.274
You can't keep your hands
off each other.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.676
I know. It is the best.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.311
How long did that last
for you and Chandler?

05:22.555 --> 05:24.819
What? It's still going on.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.891
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?

05:28.328 --> 05:32.424
I am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.101
Okay, you know where you are
better than I do.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.497
Why don't you just calm down?

05:39.572 --> 05:44.703
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.612
God, I woke the beast.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.576
I was wrong, obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.184
It is okay.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.754
As long as you know Chandler and l
are also hot and fiery.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.254
Just as hot as you.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.687
I mean, our flame....

06:00.960 --> 06:03.224
It is on fire!

06:05.064 --> 06:06.554
Here's your broom back.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.631
You are so cute!

06:16.676 --> 06:19.975
The cute bar keeps getting lower
and lower, doesn't it?

06:25.251 --> 06:26.548
How'd the interview go?

06:26.753 --> 06:30.689
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.826
Did you say you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.464
Did you get drunk on the way over there?

06:41.601 --> 06:44.900
Well, that explains why you didn't do
the other stuff.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.633
So, what happened?

06:46.839 --> 06:50.002
It was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.676
I even made him laugh.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.142
He said something about a boat...

06:54.347 --> 06:59.080
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."

07:02.522 --> 07:05.719
Trust me.
It was actually very funny.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.326
Anyway, we were
saying goodbye and....

07:09.595 --> 07:10.584
What happened?

07:10.863 --> 07:12.524
We were shaking hands...

07:12.732 --> 07:14.757
...and he leaned in toward me.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.992
Maybe he was opening the door...

07:17.203 --> 07:20.570
...but I totally
misread him and I....

07:27.747 --> 07:29.578
You kissed him?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.943
I didn't know what else to do!

07:32.585 --> 07:34.177
You could have tried...

07:34.420 --> 07:36.012
...not kissing him.

07:36.722 --> 07:37.711
Thanks, Chandler.

07:37.924 --> 07:41.655
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.
You got a second interview.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.887
Monica, that's not funny.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.860
Oh, okay.

07:46.032 --> 07:50.935
A guy from Ralph Lauren called
You got a second interview

07:54.207 --> 07:56.334
Oh, my God, Monica,
you better be serious.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.376
You just told me to be funny!

07:59.545 --> 08:02.810
Oh, my God. I can't believe it!
I got a second interview.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.042
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?

08:06.452 --> 08:09.216
You don't think that's
why he wants me back?

08:09.455 --> 08:10.683
Yeah!

08:11.691 --> 08:12.953
No?

08:14.026 --> 08:15.550
What are you talking about?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.687
I accidentally kissed him
in the interview...

08:18.898 --> 08:20.695
...and now he wants me back...

08:20.900 --> 08:24.836
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody!"

08:26.539 --> 08:27.563
Come on, Rach.

08:27.807 --> 08:31.243
What if he thinks
I'll just sleep with him?

08:31.577 --> 08:33.807
He wants you back because
you're right for the job.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.847
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?

08:38.050 --> 08:41.986
Rachel, don't say that. I think
you just need a hug from Joey.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.246
Come on. Come on.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.416
She's back! Hot girl's back!

08:48.060 --> 08:51.723
Well, I'm not totally back yet,
but I appreciate it.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.762
No. In Ross' building.
She's back!

08:55.001 --> 08:57.094
Wait there.
I'll be over in a second.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.870
One, two, three....
Got it!

09:03.743 --> 09:06.177
I gotta check out this hot girl.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.907
There she is!

09:16.622 --> 09:19.182
Damn it! Did you move?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.254
Yes.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.758
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.465
I'm Ross.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.616
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?

09:49.155 --> 09:50.679
No, I'm all alone.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.790
Yeah. Sorry about that.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.957
Hey, little girl.

10:02.168 --> 10:06.662
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter,
by any chance, a hot girl?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.268
-Daddy!
-Later, girl!

10:15.514 --> 10:17.141
Oh, man!

10:19.819 --> 10:21.650
Hot girl?

10:23.489 --> 10:25.184
Hot girl!

10:30.196 --> 10:32.323
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.033
-It's nice to see you again.
-Thank you.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.330
What?

10:43.009 --> 10:45.034
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, let me

10:45.811 --> 10:49.110
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, look...

10:49.315 --> 10:51.681
...I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

10:51.884 --> 10:55.945
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.

10:56.188 --> 10:59.715
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...

10:59.959 --> 11:04.726
...the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.828
Good day, sir.

11:09.735 --> 11:14.263
If you're going in there to see Mr. Zelner,
I hope you're ready to put out.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.536
I am.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.943
You are not gonna believe...

11:25.151 --> 11:27.847
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me!

11:31.924 --> 11:35.189
Okay, that's amazing!
How did you know that?

11:36.328 --> 11:37.625
You got ink on your lip.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.075
What do you say, maybe,
sometime I hold your gun?

11:51.277 --> 11:53.108
We're not supposed to do that.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.844
What could happen? I mean

11:57.616 --> 11:59.709
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.716
-Do you want to see a movie tonight?
-We can't. We already have plans.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.655
What are you doing?

12:07.860 --> 12:12.297
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.490
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.634
But have fun at the movie.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.567
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.578
Then why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.814
Because I just wanted
to know what you were doing...

12:31.050 --> 12:34.042
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...

12:34.320 --> 12:36.311
...while we were doing it all night.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.751
Will you excuse me?

12:44.396 --> 12:46.921
Chandler?
Can I see you for a second?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.900
-We have got to beat them!
-Why?

12:53.105 --> 12:56.666
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than us.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.043
So?

12:59.712 --> 13:03.614
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

13:04.116 --> 13:07.415
You've got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.716
Just to impress them, you want us
to have sex over and over...

13:11.924 --> 13:14.893
...and I'm saying no to this, why?
Get your coat!

13:26.438 --> 13:27.598
Excuse me.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.675
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.077
Apparently, he's looking
for some kind of hot girl.

13:40.886 --> 13:41.944
Who isn't?

13:48.527 --> 13:50.757
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ross.

13:51.730 --> 13:55.131
I know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.267
Never mind.

13:59.104 --> 14:02.733
I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.910
I mean, you had just moved in.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.609
I had just moved in!

14:07.813 --> 14:09.610
Thank you!

14:10.482 --> 14:11.881
Listen....

14:12.718 --> 14:14.117
Jen.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.750
I know this may sound a little....

14:20.292 --> 14:23.557
But would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?

14:24.663 --> 14:26.460
Sure, that would be nice.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.928
My number's on there.
Give me a call.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.661
I will give you a call.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.269
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

14:41.413 --> 14:43.347
I forgot my paper.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.649
That was amazing.

14:51.090 --> 14:54.821
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.318
That was amazing.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.827
We are the hottest, huh?

15:01.033 --> 15:03.627
No one is hotter than we are.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.964
-We're the best.
-No, you're the best.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.666
-No, you're the best.
-No, you're the best.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.975
I am the best.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.709
Hey, guys.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.547
What you been doing?

15:25.024 --> 15:27.015
Isn't that the girl who waved at you?

15:27.226 --> 15:30.059
I don't know, but I can
see through your sheet.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.388
Yeah, that's her.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.568
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'll never meet her.

15:37.803 --> 15:40.033
It's impossible to find her apartment!

15:40.306 --> 15:43.833
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.301
What are you talking about?

15:46.812 --> 15:49.940
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.880
No, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.384
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.

15:57.589 --> 16:01.047
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.455
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.564
I almost lost another girl
because of counting!

16:10.602 --> 16:14.003
-So you ready?
-Yeah, I'll just get my coat.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.207
-Could you get that?
-Sure.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.079
No! No!

16:35.094 --> 16:38.723
First, I would like to say
thank you for seeing me again.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.124
That's all right.

16:40.366 --> 16:44.803
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.

16:50.209 --> 16:54.771
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...

16:55.047 --> 16:57.072
...and for yelling at you.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.880
Fair enough.

16:59.118 --> 17:04.249
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who did not...

17:06.592 --> 17:08.992
...yell at you and storm out.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.957
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.

17:12.231 --> 17:16.668
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.

17:17.302 --> 17:21.329
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.097
That shows integrity.

17:23.308 --> 17:26.072
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...

17:26.311 --> 17:28.506
...and that shows courage.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.246
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...

17:34.486 --> 17:36.852
...but you've got to have courage.

17:38.190 --> 17:42.923
And finally, when I thought
you were making sexual advances...

17:43.128 --> 17:45.289
...I said no,
and I was not litigious.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.658
So there you go!
You got courage...

17:47.866 --> 17:51.495
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...

17:51.804 --> 17:54.295
...and not litigious.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.700
Look, Mr....

17:58.944 --> 18:00.275
Zelner.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.504
I knew that!

18:01.713 --> 18:03.772
Oh, I knew that.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.311
I really, really want this job.

18:07.519 --> 18:11.512
And I think I would be
really good at it.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.292
You know what?

18:17.996 --> 18:20.464
I may regret this...

18:21.333 --> 18:23.062
...but I'll give you a shot.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.862
You are? Really?

18:26.472 --> 18:28.804
Thank you. Oh, God!

18:29.241 --> 18:31.801
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?

18:33.812 --> 18:35.541
Well, how about a handshake?

18:37.015 --> 18:38.312
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

18:40.419 --> 18:43.980
I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!

18:44.423 --> 18:46.084
There!

18:47.593 --> 18:51.154
I'm gonna leave.
Thank you very much.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.259
Hey, I'll see you Monday.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.059
Are you tired?

18:59.338 --> 19:02.330
You better believe he's tired
after the day we had!

19:02.574 --> 19:05.338
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?

19:06.044 --> 19:08.774
Honey, the tortilla chips
know what you mean.

19:10.749 --> 19:12.546
Do you like that badge I got you?

19:12.751 --> 19:14.446
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.686
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.418
That's pee-pee.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.625
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.471
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.

19:35.707 --> 19:39.302
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so....

19:39.878 --> 19:41.903
-You didn't.
-We did!

19:42.648 --> 19:46.812
We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.387
The park, huh?

19:53.125 --> 19:54.922
Public place.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.892
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.567
Hi, Chandler.

20:09.808 --> 20:12.003
Monica, this is the men's room.

20:13.245 --> 20:14.769
Isn't it?

20:16.748 --> 20:18.306
Yes, it is.

20:18.483 --> 20:22.419
I've always found the men's bathroom
very sexual. Haven't you?

20:22.988 --> 20:24.319
No.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.082
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.225
Okay, I don't want
to disappoint you...

20:32.397 --> 20:36.834
...and I really don't want to disappoint
the guy in the second stall....

20:37.002 --> 20:38.697
Sorry, man.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.700
But come on, this is getting ridiculous.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.808
Come on, we can't let them win!

20:45.844 --> 20:50.247
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?

20:50.482 --> 20:52.211
Phoebe and Gary are in that...

20:52.484 --> 20:54.918
..."can't keep their hands
off each other" phase!

20:55.220 --> 20:56.585
So?

20:57.089 --> 21:01.219
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.189
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?

21:06.231 --> 21:09.029
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were...

21:09.334 --> 21:11.564
...all over each other all the time?

21:11.770 --> 21:15.069
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.710
But the truth is, I'm more
excited about where we are now.

21:19.177 --> 21:20.974
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:21.179 --> 21:24.546
I've never been in a relationship
this long before.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.242
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other...

21:28.453 --> 21:30.216
...I think that's incredible.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.356
And the fact that
this is happening with you...

21:33.725 --> 21:35.852
...I think that's pretty exciting.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.263
That's so sweet.

21:43.869 --> 21:47.305
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...

21:47.572 --> 21:49.767
...but I feel the same way.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.641
You know what I just realized?

21:56.882 --> 21:59.442
You just freaked out
about our relationship.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.050
-I did not.
-Yes, you did!

22:01.286 --> 22:02.776
Admit it. You freaked out!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.456
I freaked out a little.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.387
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.628
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.

22:10.829 --> 22:15.994
I am the relationship king, and you
are the crazy, irrational screwup!

22:20.672 --> 22:22.299
And now we're back.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.410
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.

22:34.619 --> 22:36.917
Thank God!
I can't watch him anymore.

22:37.622 --> 22:38.680
You guys ready?

22:39.257 --> 22:42.693
By the way, thank you for
loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.

22:44.596 --> 22:47.463
Man, they cannot get enough!
