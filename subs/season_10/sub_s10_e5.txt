WEBVTT

00:01.889 --> 00:04.929
You know, I'm thinking about letting
Emma have her first cookie.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.655
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.486
I've never given her a cookie.

00:11.018 --> 00:14.172
- Have you?
- No.

00:14.622 --> 00:18.174
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.

00:19.627 --> 00:22.622
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...

00:22.790 --> 00:25.022
...and we wondered
if you would write one for us?

00:25.232 --> 00:28.193
- Of course. I would be honored.
- Thank you.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.439
I think there's been an oversight.

00:34.642 --> 00:37.682
We would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.

00:37.845 --> 00:42.320
It's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.

00:46.173 --> 00:47.733
Clearly, we were wrong.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.573
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?

00:51.739 --> 00:54.016
I know how much you want
to have a baby...

00:54.181 --> 00:56.413
...and I would love
to help you get one.

00:58.265 --> 01:00.258
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.821
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.308
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People..."

01:09.957 --> 01:12.109
So excited about your letter.

01:14.201 --> 01:16.000
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

01:16.163 --> 01:19.955
- Wow, don't you look nice.
- Yes, I do.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.325
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.

01:23.531 --> 01:25.011
What's it the anniversary of?

01:25.172 --> 01:28.851
Your first date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?

01:29.056 --> 01:30.206
Yeah.

01:32.139 --> 01:34.895
So you must be going somewhere
fancy to celebrate.

01:35.222 --> 01:37.340
A knicks game.

01:37.505 --> 01:39.258
Aren't you a little overdressed?

01:39.426 --> 01:41.545
I've never had a one-year
anniversary before...

01:41.749 --> 01:44.470
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...

01:44.632 --> 01:46.464
...I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...

01:46.634 --> 01:49.389
...and we're gonna have sex
in a public restroom.

01:49.997 --> 01:51.192
You guys do that?

01:51.358 --> 01:54.194
Chandler won't even have sex
in our bathroom.

01:54.922 --> 01:57.119
That's where people
make number two.

01:58.966 --> 02:01.038
The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits

02:53.180 --> 02:57.781
So, you know, I have a little time
if you want to...

02:59.747 --> 03:03.664
I'd love to, but I really have
to grade these papers.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.385
Fine. It's fine.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.431
I'll just shower by myself.

03:09.076 --> 03:12.037
B. B. B. B. B.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.519
You gave a B
to a Pottery Barn catalog.

03:15.723 --> 03:18.285
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.

03:19.807 --> 03:23.359
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open up! It's your sister!

03:23.531 --> 03:25.763
I have to talk to you.

03:26.694 --> 03:28.413
Hi, Amy.

03:32.179 --> 03:35.254
- You're not Rachel.
- Still sharp as a tack.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.943
Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.

03:40.147 --> 03:42.140
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.539
And you are?

03:48.716 --> 03:52.234
Ross? I grew up on your block?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.518
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?

03:55.723 --> 03:57.522
I had a baby with your sister?

03:58.646 --> 04:00.319
No. I...

04:01.408 --> 04:03.971
Did I buy a falafel
from you yesterday?

04:07.254 --> 04:09.406
Yes. Yes, you did.

04:14.181 --> 04:16.014
Hi, Rachel.
Here's your sister Amy.

04:16.183 --> 04:18.620
She thinks I need pec implants.

04:19.106 --> 04:20.860
Amy? Hi.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.022
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.

04:24.191 --> 04:26.662
- The Days of our Lives guy.
- That's right, yeah.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.147
You are not good.

04:31.198 --> 04:33.635
Always nice to meet a fan.

04:34.522 --> 04:38.154
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- Well, I have huge news.

04:38.365 --> 04:42.602
- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?

04:42.770 --> 04:44.728
Her name is Emma.

04:45.973 --> 04:48.729
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

04:50.217 --> 04:53.850
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.

04:54.021 --> 04:56.139
Hey, your English is getting better.

05:01.228 --> 05:02.709
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.988
She may be the hottest girl
I've ever hated.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.872
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

05:09.036 --> 05:12.236
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.

05:12.439 --> 05:16.152
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
- What did I just say?

05:17.565 --> 05:18.919
Watch.

05:19.086 --> 05:24.085
Here, highlight the word you want
to change, go under "tools"...

05:24.251 --> 05:27.166
...and the thesaurus generates...
Gives.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.853
Gives a whole list of choices.

05:31.018 --> 05:33.375
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.852
My God, that's great. I'm smart.

05:36.023 --> 05:37.343
No, no, I'm:

05:37.505 --> 05:40.864
"Brainy, bright, clever."
I love this thing!

05:41.028 --> 05:44.387
Look out, ladies!
Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!

05:46.754 --> 05:48.154
God...

05:48.355 --> 05:50.747
...so beautiful.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.432
I know, isn't she?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.832
No, I was talking about your bedding.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.035
All right, what's your news, Amy?

06:01.128 --> 06:02.482
Well...

06:02.650 --> 06:04.369
...I'm getting married.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.604
Wow! Oh, my God!

06:06.774 --> 06:09.336
- To who?
- This guy.

06:11.098 --> 06:13.695
He has a killer apartment.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.056
- And...?
- And it's on Fifth.

06:19.226 --> 06:22.107
And the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

06:22.309 --> 06:25.270
- No, what's he like?
- Oh, he's okay.

06:27.034 --> 06:29.152
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?

06:29.356 --> 06:32.476
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.194
- Wow, so he's gotta be...
- Old? Yeah.

06:39.126 --> 06:41.802
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.

06:43.891 --> 06:46.487
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...

06:46.654 --> 06:49.090
...you like the apartment
more than you like...

06:49.296 --> 06:50.491
Myron.

06:50.818 --> 06:52.411
Yeah, I told you he was old.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.098
Sit down. Sit down.

06:55.262 --> 06:56.777
Honey, you know...

06:56.944 --> 06:59.825
...I once also almost married
somebody that I didn't love.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.264
- Do you remember Barry?
- Remember him?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.824
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.

07:07.755 --> 07:10.317
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.999
But anyway, listen.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.799
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.

07:16.964 --> 07:20.961
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.

07:21.128 --> 07:25.843
Someone that is your age,
that is smart, that is fun...

07:26.013 --> 07:28.735
...and that you care about.

07:30.337 --> 07:31.533
You're right.

07:31.699 --> 07:33.851
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.494
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.

07:39.987 --> 07:41.980
Okay, let's keep talking.

07:50.357 --> 07:53.238
Excuse me. Anniversary.

07:53.561 --> 07:56.441
Excuse me. Anniversary.

07:59.006 --> 08:03.242
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.

08:05.012 --> 08:07.244
It's my anniversary.

08:11.338 --> 08:12.932
Here we are.

08:13.100 --> 08:16.300
- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
- I know.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.057
This has been the best year...

08:19.787 --> 08:22.748
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!

08:22.950 --> 08:25.386
I never thought I could
love someone this much!

08:25.593 --> 08:27.506
I feel the same way!

08:27.715 --> 08:31.997
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!

08:35.402 --> 08:37.156
It's our anniversary.

08:39.206 --> 08:42.964
Knicks fans, please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

08:43.130 --> 08:44.929
Someone has a special question to ask.

08:50.217 --> 08:54.659
How lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.

08:54.822 --> 08:58.215
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.

09:00.508 --> 09:01.703
Excuse me.

09:05.553 --> 09:08.433
I finished my recommendation.
Here.

09:08.996 --> 09:11.832
And I think you'll be very, very happy.

09:11.999 --> 09:15.278
It's the longest I ever spent
on a computer without looking at porn.

09:16.844 --> 09:19.680
I don't understand.

09:20.648 --> 09:23.643
Some of the words a little
too sophisticated for you?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.244
It doesn't make any sense.

09:26.453 --> 09:30.531
Well, of course it does. It's smart.
I used a thesaurus.

09:31.378 --> 09:33.052
On every word?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.375
Yep.

09:36.864 --> 09:40.382
All right, what was
this sentence originally?

09:40.828 --> 09:43.550
"They are warm, nice people
with big hearts."

09:43.751 --> 09:48.546
And that became, "They are humid,
prepossessing Homo sapiens...

09:48.716 --> 09:51.870
...with full-sized aortic pumps."

09:53.480 --> 09:56.681
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.

09:58.285 --> 10:00.848
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

10:01.048 --> 10:03.120
- Why not?
- Well, because you signed it:

10:03.290 --> 10:06.126
"Baby kangaroo Tribbiani."

10:10.618 --> 10:13.897
Why don't you stop worrying about
sounding smart and just be yourself.

10:14.061 --> 10:16.703
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.

10:16.864 --> 10:18.743
Your full-sized aortic pump.

10:23.631 --> 10:25.942
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.

10:26.113 --> 10:29.153
- I left Myron.
- Good for you!

10:29.356 --> 10:32.317
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.522
Yes, you are.

10:36.684 --> 10:39.645
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.366
So can I stay with you?

10:44.652 --> 10:48.011
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

10:51.338 --> 10:53.490
Look who's back.

10:53.661 --> 10:55.972
Why do you have bags?
Why does she have bags?

10:56.423 --> 10:57.904
I'm staying with you guys.

10:58.105 --> 11:00.098
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

11:00.307 --> 11:01.297
Come on.

11:09.997 --> 11:11.512
- You slept out here?
- Yeah.

11:11.679 --> 11:15.517
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

11:16.604 --> 11:20.395
But we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

11:20.608 --> 11:22.760
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

11:22.930 --> 11:25.606
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said:

11:25.773 --> 11:28.084
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

11:29.617 --> 11:32.258
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

11:32.419 --> 11:34.332
Joey, look,
I know that she's difficult...

11:34.502 --> 11:37.064
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.385
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

11:42.790 --> 11:46.787
No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

11:46.994 --> 11:51.230
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

11:51.438 --> 11:53.271
Yeah. Monica made us.

11:54.682 --> 11:56.595
Well, whatever.
I really appreciate it...

11:56.764 --> 11:59.725
...because I don't think I would be
the person I am today...

11:59.887 --> 12:01.641
...if it wasn't for you guys.

12:01.809 --> 12:04.279
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

12:04.451 --> 12:07.606
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.

12:08.576 --> 12:11.172
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.657
That's what I'm wearing today.
That's why I hung it on the door.

12:16.223 --> 12:18.295
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

12:22.830 --> 12:26.269
You know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

12:26.433 --> 12:30.066
...for us to sit down and, you know,
talk about your future.

12:30.237 --> 12:32.993
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.561
I am not happy.

12:37.444 --> 12:39.722
Sure you want to eat that?

12:41.809 --> 12:44.531
I'm curvy and I like it!

12:48.415 --> 12:50.055
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:50.217 --> 12:52.780
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.012
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

12:55.222 --> 13:00.301
Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

13:02.469 --> 13:04.827
- Seriously?
- Word.

13:07.114 --> 13:08.309
Mine was worse than that.

13:08.475 --> 13:10.548
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game.

13:10.718 --> 13:13.439
This guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

13:13.601 --> 13:16.117
- That is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

13:16.283 --> 13:20.804
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.887
Oh, my God.
Mike was gonna propose?

13:23.090 --> 13:25.128
- That's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

13:25.332 --> 13:27.290
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

13:27.454 --> 13:29.766
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna do it...

13:29.937 --> 13:34.298
...I don't think he'll ever ask again.
I said no in Barbados, and now this?

13:34.461 --> 13:37.137
She's right. If I were a guy and...

13:41.909 --> 13:44.710
Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?

13:45.432 --> 13:48.746
You don't need him to propose to you.
Maybe you could propose to him.

13:49.116 --> 13:52.429
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

13:52.640 --> 13:54.712
I proposed to Chandler.

13:58.325 --> 14:00.204
All right, moving on.

14:00.608 --> 14:02.805
I don't think it was desperate.
It was amazing.

14:02.970 --> 14:03.960
Thank you.

14:04.131 --> 14:08.094
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

14:08.255 --> 14:12.332
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

14:14.742 --> 14:17.212
Okay. Okay.
So how should I do it?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.577
How about at a game
on the big screen?

14:20.347 --> 14:23.148
How about at a Foot Locker?

14:24.151 --> 14:28.114
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

14:28.275 --> 14:31.715
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

14:31.879 --> 14:35.397
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

14:35.563 --> 14:37.715
But what would a guy think?

14:40.688 --> 14:42.521
- Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.

14:42.930 --> 14:46.209
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

14:46.774 --> 14:48.367
She did?

14:48.536 --> 14:50.688
Who got her condo in Boca?

14:51.779 --> 14:53.179
Hello?

14:53.981 --> 14:55.974
It's our nanny.

14:56.183 --> 14:57.504
Hi.

14:57.665 --> 15:02.185
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

15:02.349 --> 15:04.023
That's Molly. She's sick.

15:04.191 --> 15:07.186
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

15:07.354 --> 15:10.235
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

15:10.437 --> 15:12.157
Menstrual cramps.

15:14.001 --> 15:16.278
I don't think that's what this is.

15:17.444 --> 15:20.086
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.009
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.602
Great. Shoot.
What am I gonna do?

15:25.813 --> 15:27.567
Well, I could do it.

15:27.735 --> 15:31.048
- Well, actually...
- Can I talk to you for a second?

15:32.740 --> 15:35.495
I do not want her babysitting our child.

15:35.663 --> 15:39.056
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

15:39.266 --> 15:42.420
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

15:42.630 --> 15:44.623
- The next one?
- Okay.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.424
I don't want her watching our baby.

15:48.596 --> 15:51.671
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

15:51.839 --> 15:53.672
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

15:53.841 --> 15:57.918
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.195
You know, I don't know.

15:59.366 --> 16:00.562
Ross, I'm telling you...

16:00.768 --> 16:04.400
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

16:04.572 --> 16:08.124
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

16:09.577 --> 16:14.211
Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

16:15.743 --> 16:18.544
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

16:18.706 --> 16:21.826
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

16:24.271 --> 16:26.834
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

16:26.994 --> 16:29.146
So how much does it pay?

16:35.242 --> 16:37.394
How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

16:37.565 --> 16:40.765
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.164
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

16:44.331 --> 16:46.802
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

16:47.014 --> 16:48.654
No can do, amigo.

16:50.297 --> 16:53.896
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

16:54.702 --> 16:56.695
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

16:56.864 --> 16:59.255
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

17:00.307 --> 17:01.583
See you later.

17:01.749 --> 17:05.301
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

17:05.472 --> 17:07.226
We're never gonna get a kid.

17:07.434 --> 17:09.507
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

17:09.677 --> 17:12.911
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.714
It's okay. You know what?

17:14.882 --> 17:18.161
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

17:18.325 --> 17:19.806
Okay, good.

17:20.568 --> 17:22.048
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

17:22.209 --> 17:26.331
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and...

17:31.378 --> 17:32.368
Okay.

17:33.581 --> 17:36.143
Thank you. Goodbye.

17:36.343 --> 17:38.097
We're screwed, aren't we?

17:38.265 --> 17:40.862
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

17:42.469 --> 17:43.745
- They loved it.
- What?

17:43.911 --> 17:47.828
They thought it was very smart of us
to have a child write the letter.

17:48.996 --> 17:50.829
They thought Joey was a child?

17:51.038 --> 17:53.919
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

17:57.004 --> 17:59.361
- Hi.
- Hey, what'd you guys do today?

17:59.527 --> 18:04.480
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

18:04.972 --> 18:07.887
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

18:08.055 --> 18:09.536
Babies are dull.

18:11.178 --> 18:14.936
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

18:15.863 --> 18:19.415
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

18:20.988 --> 18:22.548
- Ready?
- Yeah.

18:26.393 --> 18:28.272
You pierced her ears?

18:28.475 --> 18:31.197
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

18:35.923 --> 18:38.314
You pierced her ears?

18:38.526 --> 18:40.803
How could you do this
without telling me?

18:41.008 --> 18:44.527
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

18:44.892 --> 18:46.372
I think she looks cute.

18:47.174 --> 18:49.212
But I am wrong.

18:50.017 --> 18:54.219
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

18:54.582 --> 18:56.859
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

18:58.225 --> 18:59.819
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!

18:59.987 --> 19:03.745
Hi, Emma.
Why is she wearing her hat so low?

19:03.951 --> 19:08.426
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

19:08.596 --> 19:09.586
Why not?

19:09.757 --> 19:12.319
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

19:12.479 --> 19:15.714
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

19:15.923 --> 19:18.838
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

19:19.527 --> 19:21.520
Come here. Come here.

19:21.729 --> 19:24.929
There she is. Hi.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.453
- What?
- Nothing.

19:30.457 --> 19:32.097
Hi.

19:33.861 --> 19:35.056
What...?

19:45.753 --> 19:49.465
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

19:49.997 --> 19:52.069
Did she do this to her?

19:52.239 --> 19:54.597
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

19:54.762 --> 19:56.641
I know, I know.
And you were right, Ross.

19:56.844 --> 20:00.283
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!

20:00.487 --> 20:02.241
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?

20:02.530 --> 20:06.242
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.

20:06.453 --> 20:08.093
Okay.

20:08.536 --> 20:13.899
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.

20:15.182 --> 20:18.940
All I wanted to do was help you try
to figure out what to do with your life.

20:19.146 --> 20:20.341
This is how you repay me?

20:20.508 --> 20:24.106
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.

20:24.311 --> 20:27.864
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.

20:28.235 --> 20:32.791
I am going to be a baby stylist.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.961
- What?
- That's not a thing!

20:37.925 --> 20:39.484
Well, it should be.

20:39.647 --> 20:42.322
I'm gonna help babies learn
how to accessorize...

20:42.489 --> 20:45.724
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.

20:45.933 --> 20:49.896
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.

20:50.457 --> 20:54.010
- Amy, I... I just... I just wanna...
- What? What are you gonna do?

20:55.543 --> 20:58.538
No more falafel for you!

21:10.157 --> 21:12.150
Great game, huh?

21:14.762 --> 21:18.839
- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
- I'm not. I'm praying.

21:19.006 --> 21:21.124
Please let the knicks win.

21:21.288 --> 21:23.360
Thank you, Thor.

21:24.411 --> 21:26.928
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

21:27.094 --> 21:29.212
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?

21:30.337 --> 21:34.574
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.

21:35.182 --> 21:38.735
Knicks fans, please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

21:40.107 --> 21:42.783
Someone has a special question to ask.

21:45.192 --> 21:47.948
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?

21:49.316 --> 21:52.995
Get a load of this.
She's proposing to him!

21:53.160 --> 21:56.634
Guess we know who wears
the pants in that family.

21:56.804 --> 21:59.320
Well, that's not very enlightened.

22:03.250 --> 22:06.211
Boo us? Boo you!

22:11.899 --> 22:15.578
Hello?
Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.

22:15.743 --> 22:17.576
Oh, hi.

22:19.226 --> 22:21.584
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.

22:22.950 --> 22:26.423
No, my mommy and daddy
aren't home right now.

22:27.675 --> 22:29.827
Okay, bye-bye.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.593
She was nice.

22:35.482 --> 22:39.035
Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out.

22:40.047 --> 22:44.090
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.

22:44.291 --> 22:46.363
At least now people
will know she's a girl!

22:48.776 --> 22:51.292
I can't believe I ever
even tried to help you.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.929
- You are so beyond help!
- You know what?

22:54.141 --> 22:56.977
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.

22:57.184 --> 22:58.744
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...

22:58.906 --> 23:01.183
...to marry the old guy
with the great apartment.

23:01.348 --> 23:05.949
Then I tried to help your daughter
de-emphasize her flaws...

23:06.113 --> 23:08.106
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

23:08.315 --> 23:12.028
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!

23:12.760 --> 23:15.960
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.

23:16.123 --> 23:19.084
Just us sisters back together again
like when we were kids."

23:19.246 --> 23:21.318
Except without that stupid Jill.

23:22.289 --> 23:24.522
Who has gotten fat, by the way.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.563
Seriously?

23:28.095 --> 23:30.213
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.

23:30.417 --> 23:33.093
- Hips or thighs?
- Ass and face.

23:34.461 --> 23:37.137
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.

23:37.344 --> 23:39.223
She was. Carbs found her.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.987
See? This is what I wanted.

23:46.153 --> 23:49.593
Two sisters talking about real stuff.

23:52.079 --> 23:53.992
Oh, I can give you that.

23:54.522 --> 23:56.434
- You can?
- Yeah.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.399
I kept trying to make you
a better person, but you're...

23:59.567 --> 24:02.801
You're already a pretty perfect
version of what you are.

24:03.771 --> 24:05.650
Thank you.

24:05.813 --> 24:08.375
You gotta admit,
Emma does look cute.

24:09.937 --> 24:13.296
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

24:19.587 --> 24:22.342
That woman didn't know what
she was talking about, Mike.

24:22.510 --> 24:24.742
Obviously, you have balls.

24:25.953 --> 24:28.789
- Please, let's forget the whole thing.
- I would love it.

24:28.956 --> 24:30.789
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.

24:31.599 --> 24:33.192
But just so you know...

24:33.360 --> 24:38.759
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

24:39.206 --> 24:41.324
Whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game...

24:41.488 --> 24:43.321
...or in skywriting...

24:43.490 --> 24:46.087
...or, you know, like some lame
guy in a cheesy movie...

24:46.253 --> 24:48.211
...who hides it in the cake.

24:53.501 --> 24:56.097
It's in the cake, isn't it?

24:57.144 --> 25:00.504
Where else would lame
Mr. No Balls hide it?

25:00.668 --> 25:03.389
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?

25:03.551 --> 25:05.862
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

25:06.073 --> 25:08.464
I keep trying to propose
in these stupid ways...

25:08.636 --> 25:12.679
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you...

25:16.524 --> 25:19.997
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.

25:23.410 --> 25:25.403
- Phoebe, I...
- Wait. Oh, wait.

25:36.263 --> 25:38.826
Ready? Okay.

25:41.308 --> 25:43.905
Phoebe, I love you.

25:45.432 --> 25:49.874
There's no one else in the world I would
ask to marry me three times.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.469
But I want to take care of you...

25:53.641 --> 25:54.995
...have babies with you...

25:56.403 --> 25:58.441
...and grow old with you.

26:00.447 --> 26:03.408
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

26:04.371 --> 26:06.045
Yes.

26:12.299 --> 26:14.691
- I love you.
- I love you more.

26:14.902 --> 26:16.018
Not possible.

26:25.152 --> 26:27.669
She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!

26:33.040 --> 26:36.115
So how's the baby-styling
business going?

26:36.283 --> 26:38.321
Not that great.

26:38.485 --> 26:42.198
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.

26:43.290 --> 26:45.727
That's shocking.

26:46.774 --> 26:49.530
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.

26:51.098 --> 26:53.489
Hello, Ross?

26:55.142 --> 26:56.657
He's rude.

27:00.868 --> 27:01.858
