WEBVTT

00:05.117 --> 00:07.517
-I'm ready.
-You sure?

00:07.819 --> 00:10.481
Let me just straighten out
your heImet there.

00:10.689 --> 00:14.352
-Thanks, Daddy.
-No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

00:16.061 --> 00:19.053
-AII right, it's aII yours.
-Okay, okay.

00:19.298 --> 00:21.061
There you go, there you go.

00:21.300 --> 00:25.259
Wow, Ben's first big-kid's bike.
This is so e<i>x</i>citing!

00:25.470 --> 00:27.404
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

00:27.639 --> 00:30.130
It was my si<i>x</i>th birthday.
I went to the park...

00:30.342 --> 00:33.800
-...and I got on it, and it bent.
-Yeah.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.474
-I never had a bike of my own.
-What?

00:37.683 --> 00:39.480
We didn't have a Iot of money.

00:39.685 --> 00:42.415
But the girI across the street
had the best bike.

00:42.654 --> 00:47.057
It was pink, and it had rainbow-coIored
tasseIs hanging off the handIes...

00:47.326 --> 00:50.295
...and a beII
and this big, white wicker basket...

00:50.529 --> 00:53.521
...with those
pIastic daisies stuck on.

00:54.066 --> 00:56.330
That sounds Iike my first bike.

00:57.803 --> 00:59.566
My dad gave me his oId one.

01:00.739 --> 01:02.900
-Did the girI ever Iet you ride it?
-No.

01:03.108 --> 01:05.508
But she gave me the bo<i>x</i>
that it came in.

01:06.011 --> 01:09.105
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

01:09.281 --> 01:13.615
So I wouId sit on it, and my stepdad
wouId drag me around the backyard.

01:14.419 --> 01:16.046
That is so unfair.

01:16.388 --> 01:19.255
Not reaIIy, I got
to drag him around too.

01:20.192 --> 01:22.387
The One With AII the Candy

02:02.934 --> 02:04.731
Hey, what are you guys doing?

02:04.970 --> 02:07.029
Making candy for the neighbors.

02:07.506 --> 02:08.530
I'm sorry, who?

02:10.075 --> 02:12.168
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

02:12.377 --> 02:15.346
When the neighbors waIk by,
they can take a piece.

02:16.748 --> 02:19.239
-But we don't know the neighbors.
-I do.

02:19.418 --> 02:22.353
There's, Iet's see,
the guy with the mustache...

02:22.554 --> 02:25.887
...smokes-a-Iot Iady,
some kids I've seen...

02:26.158 --> 02:30.151
...and a red-haired guy
who does not Iike to be caIIed Rusty.

02:30.595 --> 02:33.928
Oh, I know that guy.
He aIso doesn't Iike it when you say:

02:34.099 --> 02:36.329
''Back off, Howdy Doody. I'm engaged.''

02:37.069 --> 02:39.367
You got hit on by Firebeard?

02:40.572 --> 02:43.268
See, this is e<i>x</i>actIy why
I'm making this candy.

02:43.475 --> 02:45.443
We can get to know our neighbors.

02:45.644 --> 02:48.010
WouIdn't it be easier
if we just moved?

02:50.649 --> 02:52.844
Good morning!

02:53.085 --> 02:56.418
-Somebody's in a good mood.
-WeII, why shouIdn't I be?

02:56.621 --> 02:59.613
I have great friends.
I have a wonderfuI job--

02:59.825 --> 03:02.851
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.255
It's not a big deaI.

03:04.463 --> 03:08.490
We stayed up aII night creating a pIan
so that us dating won't be a probIem.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.497
Oh, yeah? What's the pIan?

03:13.939 --> 03:17.170
We-- We are not...

03:18.176 --> 03:20.110
...going to Iet it...

03:20.312 --> 03:21.973
...be a probIem.

03:22.914 --> 03:26.008
It took you aII night
to come up with that pIan?

03:26.218 --> 03:28.652
WeII, you know,
we did other stuff too.

03:30.088 --> 03:31.077
Did you two...?

03:31.289 --> 03:33.849
Oh, I don't sIeep with guys
on the first date.

03:34.092 --> 03:36.720
-Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise--
-Anymore!

03:43.668 --> 03:47.035
Hi, Tag, I have a conference caII
today, is that correct?

03:47.272 --> 03:50.298
-Yes, at 4.
-Okay, thank you, that'II be aII.

03:51.009 --> 03:53.000
Wait, wait.

03:56.615 --> 03:59.049
Did you see that?
He had no idea...

03:59.217 --> 04:01.777
...there was something
going on between us.

04:08.660 --> 04:12.152
-I'd better get back to my desk.
-Okay, hard worker.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.157
I'II put that in your evaIuation.

04:16.501 --> 04:19.265
-My what?
-You've been here for two months now.

04:19.504 --> 04:23.167
And your boss is re<i>q</i>uired to hand in
a performance evaIuation.

04:23.375 --> 04:27.243
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaIuate.

04:34.219 --> 04:38.212
-Are you serious?
-No, I've just aIways wanted to do that.

04:38.890 --> 04:40.755
Can you heIp me cIean this up?

04:45.597 --> 04:48.430
-I'm e<i>x</i>cited to see if anyone ate my candy.
-Me too!

04:48.600 --> 04:50.727
-You don't have to do that.
-Thanks.

04:51.870 --> 04:55.101
The basket is totaIIy empty!
The neighbors ate it aII!

04:55.307 --> 04:56.774
WeII, either that or....

04:56.975 --> 05:00.570
No. Not even Joey couId eat that much.

05:00.745 --> 05:03.475
LittIe refresher, popcorn shrimp night.

05:04.482 --> 05:05.540
Joey!

05:07.752 --> 05:08.776
Yeah?

05:08.987 --> 05:12.115
-Did you eat aII the neighbor candy?
-That was the pIan.

05:12.324 --> 05:15.589
When I got to it,
there was onIy a few pieces Ieft.

05:15.794 --> 05:17.921
They've come by aII day.
They Iove it.

05:18.597 --> 05:20.758
They Iove my candy?

05:20.999 --> 05:23.991
-Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
-Hey, Mon.

05:24.236 --> 05:29.196
Make some more Iasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

05:30.008 --> 05:32.272
Ross, the neighbors ate aII my candy.

05:32.477 --> 05:34.069
Mine stoIe my newspaper.

05:34.279 --> 05:35.837
It's Iike a crime wave.

05:40.018 --> 05:42.213
Pheebs, you got a second?

05:42.420 --> 05:43.580
Sure.

05:44.322 --> 05:46.722
Ever since you toId me
about that bike...

05:46.992 --> 05:49.153
...I couIdn't stop thinking about it.

05:49.361 --> 05:53.058
I mean, everyone shouId have
a first bike, you know? So....

05:56.902 --> 05:59.735
Oh, my God, Ross!

06:00.038 --> 06:01.869
-You Iike it?
-I Iove it!

06:02.140 --> 06:04.370
-Yeah?
-Oh, oh, God--

06:04.643 --> 06:06.634
And I Iove you.

06:07.045 --> 06:08.512
Not that way.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.442
But the bike got you a Iot cIoser.

06:12.017 --> 06:13.780
WeII, take it downstairs.

06:14.052 --> 06:15.883
You know, give it a test drive.

06:16.087 --> 06:18.248
Okay. Oh, my God.

06:18.723 --> 06:20.623
My first bike!

06:20.926 --> 06:23.918
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

06:24.562 --> 06:26.052
You're weIcome.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.494
Oh, and ChandIer's about to cry.

06:32.737 --> 06:33.829
Am not.

06:34.906 --> 06:38.342
Hey, dude, it's okay. It kind of...

06:38.510 --> 06:40.808
...got to me a IittIe too.

06:40.979 --> 06:43.447
I'm just so gIad I couId make her happy.

06:43.848 --> 06:46.009
Thanks. I'm gIad I'm not aIone on this.

06:46.184 --> 06:48.379
-Yeah, you are.
-Yeah, you are.

06:52.457 --> 06:53.583
Who is that?

06:54.392 --> 06:55.916
Don't worry, I'm brave.

06:56.127 --> 06:58.459
I-- I am brave.

07:00.031 --> 07:01.794
No, no, no, no!

07:03.101 --> 07:05.331
Can you teII me who is there, pIease?

07:06.438 --> 07:09.100
My name's Gary. I Iive upstairs.

07:11.443 --> 07:12.740
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:12.944 --> 07:16.175
-Do you know what time it is?
-It's candy time.

07:16.848 --> 07:19.976
My roommate says they taste
Iike IittIe drops of heaven.

07:20.185 --> 07:22.050
Oh, pIease.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.218
Did you hear that?
''LittIe drops of heaven.''

07:26.825 --> 07:28.349
Four a.m.

07:28.626 --> 07:30.787
So can I get some candy?

07:31.062 --> 07:35.260
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up earIy and go to work.

07:35.767 --> 07:39.032
He does not know
that I am not ''some of us.''

07:39.771 --> 07:42.535
-He can hear me, can't he?
-Yeah.

07:43.308 --> 07:46.300
I'm sorry, but I'II put some out
in the morning.

07:46.511 --> 07:48.877
Okay, I'II swing by Iater.

07:49.147 --> 07:50.978
You Iive in this buiIding?

07:52.183 --> 07:54.048
Seems Iike I'd remember you.

07:57.255 --> 07:59.120
Night, Gar.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.295
Is there anybody in this buiIding
that does not hit on you?

08:05.463 --> 08:07.693
Smokes-a-Iot Iady.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.465
Oh, wait, that is not true.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.878
So did you read your evaIuation yet?

08:25.050 --> 08:27.416
No, it was marked ''confidentiaI.''

08:27.685 --> 08:29.676
I just sent it to human resources.

08:33.091 --> 08:36.959
PIease, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

08:37.228 --> 08:39.059
A joke they wouId appreciate?

08:39.264 --> 08:41.630
I'm thinking, no.

08:42.300 --> 08:46.703
-What did you say?
-I said you were a good kisser...

08:46.905 --> 08:51.239
...and that I Iiked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.405
No, not my tushy.

08:54.612 --> 08:55.738
It gets worse.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.107
About your initiative, I wrote:

08:58.316 --> 09:01.649
''He was abIe to unhook my bra
with minimaI supervision.''

09:02.954 --> 09:07.516
Under probIems with performance,
I wrote, ''Dear God, I hope not.''

09:08.126 --> 09:12.187
And then-- And then I drew
a IittIe smiIey face.

09:12.397 --> 09:15.628
And then a smaII pornographic sketch.

09:24.776 --> 09:27.711
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

09:27.912 --> 09:30.210
When I heard the story,
I aImost cried.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.972
AImost cried, huh?

09:32.250 --> 09:34.582
Hear that, ChandIer? ''AImost'' cried.

09:35.820 --> 09:39.085
Hey, you cry every time
somebody taIks about <i>Titanic</i>.

09:39.457 --> 09:41.857
Those two had onIy each other.

09:43.094 --> 09:44.527
She reaIIy Iikes it, huh?

09:44.729 --> 09:47.323
Oh, yeah. I saw her
waIking it down the street.

09:47.532 --> 09:50.592
She had these fIowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

09:50.869 --> 09:53.599
I saw her this morning,
waIking it by the park.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.531
Wait, she was waIking the bike?

09:56.741 --> 09:58.402
Both times?

09:59.677 --> 10:01.872
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Oh, hi!

10:02.113 --> 10:05.913
-Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
-Oh, so much.

10:06.618 --> 10:11.715
Pheebs, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

10:13.525 --> 10:15.083
Of course.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.261
Can we see you ride it?

10:18.596 --> 10:20.086
Okay.

10:34.579 --> 10:36.046
See?

10:42.153 --> 10:44.951
I toId you not to get
invoIved with your assistant.

10:45.156 --> 10:48.523
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.519
Did you hear that, ChandIer?

10:51.729 --> 10:53.697
No such thing.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.096
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

10:59.904 --> 11:03.704
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

11:03.942 --> 11:07.639
AbsoIuteIy, you know?
Because ''tushy'' can mean both ass...

11:07.912 --> 11:09.402
...and good worker.

11:11.216 --> 11:13.309
I just gotta get the thing back.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.553
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

11:15.753 --> 11:18.381
Might it have Iooked
a IittIe Iike this?

11:18.790 --> 11:20.553
Oh, my God, Joey!

11:22.360 --> 11:24.760
-What is the matter with you?
-God!

11:26.364 --> 11:30.391
This IittIe taIent came in handy
before I couId afford porn.

11:35.573 --> 11:40.010
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after-hours, but I reaIIy need candy.

11:40.311 --> 11:43.371
I'm sorry, I can't heIp you.
See? RuIes are ruIes.

11:43.581 --> 11:46.573
PIease, I have peopIe coming
from out of town today.

11:46.784 --> 11:49.651
-I toId them aII about your candy.
-You're kidding.

11:49.887 --> 11:52.913
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you teII them?

11:53.124 --> 11:56.525
I toId them your candy
was absoIuteIy indescribabIe.

11:56.794 --> 12:01.754
Some peopIe have said it's ''IittIe
drops of heaven.'' But whatever.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.359
-PIease, can't you heIp me out?
-Hey, ChandIer, do we know that Iady?

12:06.571 --> 12:10.598
Isn't she the woman who Iives
beIow you and has se<i>x</i> reaIIy Ioud?

12:10.842 --> 12:13.037
AII right, I'II do it just this once.

12:13.311 --> 12:16.576
-But you can't teII anyone.
-PIease, just give it to me.

12:16.781 --> 12:18.942
Yeah, that's her.

12:19.784 --> 12:21.775
-Thank you.
-UnbeIievabIe!

12:21.986 --> 12:24.420
I can't beIieve that sign didn't work.

12:24.622 --> 12:27.614
You know what wouId work?
Stop making candy.

12:28.559 --> 12:29.856
But they Iike it.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.128
You mean they Iike you.

12:33.464 --> 12:34.522
Maybe.

12:34.832 --> 12:38.097
Is that why you became a chef,
so peopIe wouId Iike you?

12:38.303 --> 12:42.364
You want to taIk about getting
peopIe to Iike you, huh, funny man?

12:52.083 --> 12:55.314
Just remember everything
I taught you, and you'II be fine.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.283
Okay? Here we go.

12:57.488 --> 12:59.388
Ready, set--

12:59.557 --> 13:02.458
Wait, this seat
is reaIIy uncomfortabIe.

13:02.727 --> 13:05.821
Maybe before we start
we shouId just get another one.

13:06.064 --> 13:09.465
Perhaps Iike an airpIane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

13:10.401 --> 13:14.565
You can't get out of this.
You have to Iearn how to ride a bike.

13:14.772 --> 13:17.673
Why? Why do I have to Iearn?

13:18.676 --> 13:23.079
-WeII, in case of an emergency.
-What kind of emergency?

13:23.281 --> 13:27.741
WeII, what if a man comes aIong
and puts a gun to your head and says:

13:27.952 --> 13:30.614
''You ride this bike or I'II--

13:30.922 --> 13:33.322
I'II shoot you.''

13:33.758 --> 13:36.090
I wouId ring the beII to distract him.

13:36.294 --> 13:39.957
Then I wouId knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

13:41.132 --> 13:44.363
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

13:44.635 --> 13:48.435
...and, hey, I'II hoId you up
and push you. Okay?

13:49.707 --> 13:51.334
You won't Iet go?

13:51.509 --> 13:52.806
-No.
-You swear?

13:53.010 --> 13:54.272
I swear.

13:56.114 --> 13:57.945
-Okay.
-Come on.

14:00.485 --> 14:02.510
AII right, here we go. AII right?

14:02.720 --> 14:03.778
-AII right.
-AII right?

14:03.988 --> 14:05.979
FeeI good?
AII right, try pedaIing.

14:06.190 --> 14:09.353
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take controI.

14:09.594 --> 14:11.858
Yes, yes, yes!

14:14.198 --> 14:16.098
Oh, no!

14:17.835 --> 14:19.132
You swore!

14:19.370 --> 14:24.034
-I just thought you were doing so weII.
-I am shocked. Shocked!

14:28.646 --> 14:31.137
It's a Iegitimate Iearning techni<i>q</i>ue.

14:32.283 --> 14:33.648
Wow.

14:41.359 --> 14:46.558
Hey, there's some peopIe outside
asking about candy.

14:46.864 --> 14:50.197
They'II just have to wait, won't they?
I onIy got two hands!

14:50.668 --> 14:53.762
-Need some heIp?
-No, you don't know the system.

14:53.971 --> 14:56.462
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

14:57.308 --> 15:01.369
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a Iot of me.

15:11.889 --> 15:13.720
Oh, heIIo, Iiar.

15:16.194 --> 15:20.028
Look, I'm reaIIy sorry
I Iet go of the bike.

15:20.298 --> 15:22.323
I couId've been kiIIed, you know.

15:24.302 --> 15:26.099
I know, I know.

15:27.705 --> 15:29.969
But can we pIease try it again?

15:30.241 --> 15:32.573
I mean, you were so cIose, Phoebe.

15:32.777 --> 15:35.337
WeII, I wouId Iove to...

15:36.113 --> 15:39.344
...but the bike got stoIen
and the poIice have no suspects.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.087
-Phoebe.
-What?

15:50.161 --> 15:52.026
What the heII?

15:53.531 --> 15:54.589
You know what?

15:54.799 --> 15:57.927
If you won't Iearn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

15:58.135 --> 16:00.160
-...I have to take it back.
-What? Why?

16:00.338 --> 16:03.739
Because it's....

16:04.642 --> 16:08.009
It'd be Iike you having this guitar...

16:08.246 --> 16:10.009
...and never pIaying it.

16:10.281 --> 16:13.148
Okay, this guitar wants to be pIayed.

16:13.384 --> 16:16.478
And this bike wants to be ridden.

16:16.754 --> 16:18.984
And if you don't ride it...

16:19.257 --> 16:23.284
...you're kiIIing its spirit.

16:24.829 --> 16:26.660
The bike...

16:27.565 --> 16:29.260
...is dying.

16:33.304 --> 16:37.798
AII right. If you care enough
to make up that Ioad of crap, okay.

16:38.175 --> 16:39.699
Great, great.

16:42.146 --> 16:44.171
You're making the bike very happy.

16:44.382 --> 16:45.644
Okay, Ross.

16:48.553 --> 16:50.384
PIease don't die!

16:54.058 --> 16:56.549
To get the evaIuation
before they see it...

16:56.761 --> 17:01.323
...we gotta get into ZeIner's office.
He doesn't get in untiI 1 0.

17:01.532 --> 17:05.559
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
earIy to eat breakfast at her desk.

17:05.770 --> 17:09.035
-That's kind of sad.
-Yeah, weII, Betty's kind of sad.

17:09.440 --> 17:13.206
Which is why I beIieve I can Iure
her away with these chocoIates.

17:14.779 --> 17:16.872
WhiIe I distract her, you go in.

17:17.081 --> 17:18.446
-Got it.
-Let's roII.

17:20.017 --> 17:22.247
HeIIo, RacheI. You got a minute?

17:22.453 --> 17:25.786
Yeah, sure, Mr. ZeIner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.821
Okay, great.

17:28.059 --> 17:29.651
Abort the pIan.

17:30.461 --> 17:33.123
ActuaIIy, I'd Iike to speak
to both of you.

17:33.564 --> 17:34.792
Okay.

17:35.900 --> 17:40.360
WeII, can we get you anything,
Mr. ZeIner? Maybe some chocoIates.

17:41.906 --> 17:44.670
No, thanks,
but I'II give these to Betty.

17:46.677 --> 17:49.373
So I read your evaIuation of Tag.

17:49.647 --> 17:52.980
Or to use his fuII name,
Tag ''Sweet Cheeks'' Jones?

17:54.819 --> 17:56.980
Is something going on with you two?

17:58.489 --> 18:02.619
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

18:04.395 --> 18:07.956
I mean, what wouId happen e<i>x</i>actIy?

18:09.133 --> 18:11.624
WeII, I'd be forced to fiIe a report.

18:11.836 --> 18:14.532
I'd have to consuIt
with the IegaI department.

18:14.772 --> 18:18.037
And your future at the company
wouId be in jeopardy.

18:19.176 --> 18:20.768
-WeII--
-Mr. ZeIner....

18:21.479 --> 18:23.640
I fiIIed in that evaIuation.

18:23.848 --> 18:25.179
-Oh, no--
-Yeah, yeah.

18:25.449 --> 18:27.440
I thought it wouId be funny.

18:28.653 --> 18:31.554
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

18:33.090 --> 18:36.787
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor.

18:37.061 --> 18:39.552
And I'm kind of strangeIy
proud of my butt.

18:40.998 --> 18:43.228
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

18:43.868 --> 18:46.564
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

18:46.771 --> 18:50.104
It's upside down, you gotta--
It doesn't matter.

18:51.509 --> 18:54.000
It's not Iike I don't have
a sense of humor.

18:54.245 --> 18:57.806
HeII, I even enjoy a naughty Iimerick
every now and then.

19:00.451 --> 19:02.078
There's a time and a pIace.

19:04.121 --> 19:06.817
UnIess you have a Iimerick right now.

19:09.427 --> 19:13.158
No? Okay.
WeII, you've got my fa<i>x</i> number.

19:21.205 --> 19:23.799
I can't beIieve you did that.
That was sweet.

19:23.974 --> 19:26.772
-Don't worry about it.
-You couId've Iost your job.

19:26.944 --> 19:30.311
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

19:32.516 --> 19:34.484
Thank you, you're great.

19:36.554 --> 19:38.488
-You know what?
-What?

19:38.789 --> 19:40.552
I feeI great.

19:41.192 --> 19:43.057
In fact....

19:47.998 --> 19:49.488
What?

19:49.667 --> 19:53.501
It's just-- It took me so Iong
to get that desk organized.

19:53.804 --> 19:55.567
I'm sorry.

19:56.774 --> 19:58.708
There it is.

20:10.588 --> 20:11.782
What is going on?

20:12.022 --> 20:15.389
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

20:15.593 --> 20:17.959
Yeah, Iady, give us candy!

20:19.530 --> 20:20.554
Joey!

20:21.465 --> 20:23.626
-What's up, buddy?
-What are you doing?

20:25.336 --> 20:26.928
Waiting to get candy.

20:27.571 --> 20:29.232
Get in here.

20:29.406 --> 20:32.842
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

20:36.347 --> 20:37.712
Merry Christmas.

20:38.949 --> 20:43.147
The candy is coming! I need
another 1 5 minutes for it to cooI.

20:44.688 --> 20:49.318
AII right, everybody, just be <i>q</i>uiet.
Be <i>q</i>uiet! Be <i>q</i>uiet! Pipe down!

20:49.527 --> 20:51.654
What is the matter with you peopIe?

20:51.862 --> 20:56.697
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you, and Iook at her.

20:58.269 --> 21:00.601
She is a mess.

21:00.771 --> 21:03.706
Her hair's not brushed.
She's got dark circIes under her eyes...

21:03.874 --> 21:08.004
...chocoIate on her face,
and she is stiII stunning.

21:10.881 --> 21:14.339
She was making candy
so she couId get to know aII of you.

21:14.552 --> 21:18.010
And I'II bet that not one of you
can teII me her name.

21:18.222 --> 21:19.689
Am I right?

21:20.391 --> 21:22.256
Candy Lady?

21:23.561 --> 21:25.893
No, not ''Candy Lady.''

21:26.764 --> 21:29.130
If we know it, can we have candy?

21:30.301 --> 21:32.030
AII right, you know what?

21:32.770 --> 21:34.795
Forget it, you've ruined it.

21:35.005 --> 21:37.030
Go home. You've ruined it.

21:37.308 --> 21:41.039
That's aII wrong! You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it!

21:47.718 --> 21:50.243
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

21:52.323 --> 21:53.415
Did you smoke?

21:54.124 --> 21:59.528
No, smokes-a-Iot Iady bIew smoke
directIy into my mouth.

22:00.531 --> 22:01.896
Are you okay?

22:02.132 --> 22:04.726
Fine, but it was
reaIIy scary for a whiIe.

22:04.935 --> 22:08.029
Someone sIipped a threatening
note under the door!

22:08.239 --> 22:12.175
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentaIity or whatever.

22:22.019 --> 22:25.113
I can't beIieve it. I did it.
I rode a bike!

22:25.322 --> 22:28.450
I never thought I'd be abIe
to do that. Thank you.

22:28.659 --> 22:31.025
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourseIf.

22:31.228 --> 22:35.062
You're the one who faced your fears
and uItimateIy overcame them.

22:35.266 --> 22:39.134
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After SchooI SpeciaI.

22:50.514 --> 22:53.506
