00:03.636 --> 00:05.501
What are you looking at?

00:05.705 --> 00:09.766
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.604
Wow! It looks really violent!

00:12.779 --> 00:15.213
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.010
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitable for children!

00:19.753 --> 00:23.621
-I cannot wait to see this.
-It's generating Oscar buzz.

00:23.823 --> 00:27.156
-I started that!
-I thought I did!

00:27.360 --> 00:29.453
I just talked to my agent..

00:29.729 --> 00:33.631
and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

00:33.833 --> 00:35.824
-Will we take a limo?
-Sure!

00:36.236 --> 00:39.967
I love taking limos
when nobody died.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.334
Well, I won't be able to come.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.842
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

00:47.013 --> 00:49.573
You should come.
Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.

00:49.749 --> 00:53.515
That way for the first few moments of her
life, she'll think we're really fancy.

00:55.021 --> 00:59.321
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

00:59.492 --> 01:03.758
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.228
I'm looking forward
to the next part..

01:06.666 --> 01:09.157
I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.371
That's right. Still no baby.

01:18.778 --> 01:21.338
What's the matter? Is the puffy,
sweaty pregnant lady..

01:21.514 --> 01:23.607
disturbing your precious
coffee time?

01:25.285 --> 01:27.583
Come on, people, make some room.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.588
Sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.518
You.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.164
Like you haven't done enough.

01:41.334 --> 01:45.634
I know you're miserable.
I wish there was something I could do.

01:45.805 --> 01:49.241
I wish I were a sea horse.

01:51.644 --> 01:55.842
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

01:58.551 --> 02:02.317
And then also,
I'd be far away in the sea.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.493
God.

02:17.137 --> 02:22.404
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.008
I know. I remember toward the end..

02:25.211 --> 02:30.274
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

02:33.052 --> 02:37.216
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

02:39.225 --> 02:40.624
Let's.

03:22.235 --> 03:25.204
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

03:27.473 --> 03:31.000
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.

03:31.644 --> 03:35.239
-What are you doing here?
-They sent me home from work.

03:35.415 --> 03:38.907
They said, "Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest."

03:39.085 --> 03:41.076
You know what? Screw them!

03:41.254 --> 03:45.122
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.

03:46.125 --> 03:49.492
Or you could do volunteer work.

03:50.997 --> 03:53.693
-Hello?
-Joey, it's Estelle.

03:53.967 --> 03:58.995
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

03:59.205 --> 04:04.006
-You told me I could have six tickets.
-I sold four on eBay.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.977
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy 372.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.881
So that's it? I only get
to bring one guest?

04:14.120 --> 04:18.284
Yeah. What time you
wanna pick me up?

04:18.691 --> 04:20.352
Hello?

04:21.194 --> 04:24.630
You hear that?
I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.

04:24.831 --> 04:29.131
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

04:30.803 --> 04:34.364
-What about me?
-You said you didn't want to go.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.508
I don't. But I would
still like to be acknowledged.

04:37.744 --> 04:42.681
-Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
-Definitely not invisible.

04:44.851 --> 04:48.548
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

04:48.821 --> 04:52.621
-You snooze, you lose.
-He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.089
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

04:55.261 --> 05:00.631
And, Joey, not that this should affect
you at all, but if you pick me..

05:00.833 --> 05:06.533
I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress cut down to here.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.269
-I haven't seen this dress.
-Star in a movie.

05:12.145 --> 05:17.014
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

05:17.183 --> 05:19.208
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.450
Well..

05:26.092 --> 05:28.560
I think I want to take Chandler.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.525
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

05:34.167 --> 05:38.160
-You want to take me?
-Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.363
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

05:41.541 --> 05:45.033
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.974
This will be my way
of paying you back.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.311
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

05:53.786 --> 05:58.086
Just because he paid for your headshots,
you're gonna take him?

05:58.257 --> 06:03.388
I don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

06:04.230 --> 06:08.826
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

06:09.102 --> 06:13.129
He read lines with me. He went with me
on auditions when I was nervous.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.636
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts that I wanted.

06:16.843 --> 06:20.438
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't.

06:20.646 --> 06:24.810
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

06:24.984 --> 06:28.181
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

06:31.424 --> 06:35.485
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

06:35.928 --> 06:41.093
-I'm gonna go shave.
-Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.597
I have to pee.

06:47.774 --> 06:53.110
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

06:54.680 --> 07:00.949
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just.. out of her.

07:02.555 --> 07:05.786
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

07:05.958 --> 07:10.361
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.064
Care to make it interesting?

07:13.299 --> 07:16.700
-I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
-You're on.

07:16.903 --> 07:20.498
-Okay, how much?
-One hundred thousand dollars.

07:21.841 --> 07:26.869
-How about 50 bucks?
-I'll call Zurich and move some money.

07:27.046 --> 07:30.573
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

07:31.884 --> 07:33.681
No one's here.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.520
Oh, damn it!

07:51.571 --> 07:56.736
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do I look?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.906
-A little tall.
-What?

08:00.146 --> 08:04.378
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?

08:05.585 --> 08:07.917
There you go.

08:09.555 --> 08:12.285
It's just so glamorous.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.730
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.832
And you're still pregnant.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.094
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.

08:25.304 --> 08:30.298
You know what? You look great.
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

08:31.944 --> 08:37.814
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

08:39.652 --> 08:43.247
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

08:43.623 --> 08:48.651
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

08:48.828 --> 08:51.058
All right, stop it.

08:51.297 --> 08:54.460
-Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
-Fine.

08:54.667 --> 09:00.435
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp.. right there?

09:01.574 --> 09:05.203
-Rachel here? We have an appointment.
-In the bathroom.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.675
-Rach, we gotta go.
-In a minute!

09:10.816 --> 09:16.186
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.822
All right, let's go.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.260
Oh, wait a minute.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.122
Do I have to pee again?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.389
No, I'm good.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.897
Do you want to go change first?

09:28.100 --> 09:32.002
The doctor's staying open late for us,
but if you hurry..

09:33.339 --> 09:36.900
-No, I'm fine.
-You don't think that's inappropriate?

09:37.510 --> 09:40.809
-What?
-Good God, man. Don't anger it.

09:44.417 --> 09:50.322
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am..

09:50.489 --> 09:54.152
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.318
No! Don't call me "Mommy."

09:56.562 --> 10:00.362
It's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.433
I'm actually with her on this one.

10:03.903 --> 10:07.100
Come on, Ross.
We're gonna be late.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.039
Either of you want to be Ross?

10:19.085 --> 10:21.747
I thought I knew who the enemy was,
but it was you.

10:21.988 --> 10:26.482
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

10:26.926 --> 10:30.726
I'm fighting for every man
in the 82nd Ground Division.

10:39.338 --> 10:42.899
Ross?
Can I ask you something?

10:43.142 --> 10:47.135
When Carol was pregnant with Ben..

10:47.647 --> 10:50.343
were you this irritating?

10:53.886 --> 10:56.081
-Excuse me?
-Nothing. You're just..

10:56.255 --> 11:01.522
You've been a little short with me
lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

11:01.694 --> 11:05.687
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

11:05.931 --> 11:10.493
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.001
Okay.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.708
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.110
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows..

11:26.285 --> 11:31.746
how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

11:34.226 --> 11:37.286
-Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
-You're nice to her.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.465
She has the drugs.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.766
We'll do a quick check.

11:43.969 --> 11:47.769
Eight days late, huh?
You must be getting uncomfortable.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.500
Yeah, just a tad.

11:51.444 --> 11:56.438
You're 80% effaced. You're on your way.
It still could last a while.

11:56.649 --> 12:01.780
-There are ways to help things along.
-Do them!

12:02.722 --> 12:06.522
Actually, they're things
that you can do. Home remedies.

12:06.759 --> 12:10.525
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

12:10.763 --> 12:16.360
-Well, we are ready to try anything.
-There's an herbal tea you can drink.

12:16.602 --> 12:20.265
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.270
We will do all of those.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.840
-Taking a long walk.
-Good. Done.

12:25.044 --> 12:28.775
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.246
You've got to be kidding me!

12:51.003 --> 12:54.131
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

12:54.807 --> 12:58.038
-You liked it? You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah!

12:58.244 --> 13:02.738
-Well, which part exactly?
-The whole thing! Here we go!

13:02.982 --> 13:05.348
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

13:05.551 --> 13:09.612
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

13:09.822 --> 13:15.658
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

13:15.895 --> 13:21.527
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.832
You fell asleep!

13:25.037 --> 13:30.202
There was no kangaroo! They didn't
take any of my suggestions!

13:32.044 --> 13:35.605
-I can't believe you fell asleep.
-I can't believe it either.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.610
Maybe it didn't happen.

13:39.785 --> 13:42.948
Maybe you fell asleep
and dreamt the whole thing.

13:43.856 --> 13:47.314
And this conversation we're having
right now is part of that dream.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.488
Wake up, Joe!

13:54.500 --> 13:59.460
-Thanks for coming. See you later.
-Don't go. I'm so sorry.

13:59.638 --> 14:03.836
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

14:05.044 --> 14:06.909
Or call an ambulance!

14:11.817 --> 14:15.719
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

14:15.888 --> 14:19.346
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.958
We tried them all.

14:21.126 --> 14:26.894
We went for a walk, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.498
There is one thing we didn't try.

14:29.668 --> 14:33.798
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

14:33.973 --> 14:37.841
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today..

14:38.010 --> 14:40.604
I think you should do it.

14:41.981 --> 14:45.473
-It's sex.
-Do it!

14:45.818 --> 14:49.481
-Monica.
-It's been a really long time for you.

14:49.688 --> 14:55.058
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.194
Oh, I don't know about that.

14:59.531 --> 15:05.868
I think if the two of you had sex, the
repercussions would be catastrophic.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.069
All right, let's be practical.

15:09.308 --> 15:15.372
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.914
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.116
Okay, okay. Yeah,
I don't think I wanna do that.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.117
You sure? I'm just saying..

15:27.293 --> 15:29.784
the baby's head
isn't getting any smaller.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.833
Monica, what is the matter with you?

15:36.101 --> 15:39.593
-I just want the baby to be born today.
-Why today?

15:40.639 --> 15:42.504
Okay, fine.

15:42.975 --> 15:47.742
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to lose.

15:48.213 --> 15:53.617
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

15:53.819 --> 15:58.347
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

16:00.626 --> 16:04.153
-I'll take that bet.
-What?

16:04.330 --> 16:08.391
I'm miserable. I may as well
make some money out of it.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.899
Can I get some of that action?

16:11.170 --> 16:13.502
I'm betting against all of you?

16:13.706 --> 16:16.675
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.638
Okay.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.213
Sixty, 80, 100.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.511
And 50.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.719
And two.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.290
Yeah, baby.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.229
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

16:43.402 --> 16:47.634
Where have you been?
I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.401
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

16:52.211 --> 16:53.576
I'm so sorry.

16:53.812 --> 16:58.340
The reason I came over is to settle things
between us. You've done a lot for me.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.975
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.485
-So how much do I owe you?
-What?

17:04.723 --> 17:08.318
-I don't want to owe you anything.
-You don't owe me.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.085
-I don't want your..
-We're doing this!

17:11.330 --> 17:14.163
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

17:14.533 --> 17:18.833
-I don't know, $500.
-Okay, $500. What else?

17:19.038 --> 17:23.839
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.

17:24.910 --> 17:29.176
Okay, so that's another $500.
That's 500 and 500. That's..

17:33.519 --> 17:36.545
-You want a calculator?
-Please.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.518
Here.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.428
All right, what else?

17:45.631 --> 17:50.568
Well, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes..

17:50.769 --> 17:53.704
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.366
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

17:58.544 --> 18:03.038
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

18:03.916 --> 18:09.479
What the hell are you talking about?
The South will rise again, man.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.887
Yes, money well-spent.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.255
Okay, what else? Rent.

18:17.463 --> 18:22.127
Two, three years of rent,
utilities, food..

18:22.401 --> 18:26.895
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for..

18:27.906 --> 18:33.936
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

18:34.179 --> 18:36.340
How do you clear this thing?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.478
Finish your enchilada.

18:43.655 --> 18:47.648
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.159
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

18:53.999 --> 18:58.595
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

18:59.171 --> 19:04.507
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.806
I am feeling nothing.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.946
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that..

19:16.121 --> 19:19.818
really makes me want
to have sex with you.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.786
-Stop it.
-Come on! Why are we wasting time?

19:23.962 --> 19:28.490
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

19:28.667 --> 19:34.537
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.698
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.038
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

19:41.313 --> 19:44.805
I'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.508
Make love? What are you, a girl?

19:50.289 --> 19:53.554
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

19:53.792 --> 19:58.354
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

19:58.530 --> 20:03.229
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.569
I love when you talk dirty to me.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.810
I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.740
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.453
Let me just bend over and get it.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.453
Oh, God!

20:34.466 --> 20:37.958
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

20:38.203 --> 20:40.763
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.840
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

20:45.410 --> 20:48.345
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

20:50.015 --> 20:53.178
-You know what?
-What?

20:53.485 --> 20:55.476
Forget it.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.687
What now, Ross,
you're not gonna talk?

20:59.858 --> 21:03.589
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

21:03.862 --> 21:06.922
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

21:10.135 --> 21:14.367
You'd think the jalapeno would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

21:14.606 --> 21:17.200
That's not enough..
What are you doing?

21:17.376 --> 21:19.936
I'm getting that baby out of you!

21:27.052 --> 21:28.883
-Oh, God!
-I know.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.248
Oh, no, no, no.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.891
I think my water just broke.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.553
I am good!

21:39.564 --> 21:43.660
Okay, I got the pillow.
I got the bag.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.599
-You got the keys?
-I got the keys.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.540
We're having a baby.

22:06.925 --> 22:11.862
I didn't have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time..?

22:12.097 --> 22:14.964
-Not so much.
-Okay, let's go.

22:19.604 --> 22:20.832
-200.
-Thank you.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.999
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.405
Okay.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.942
Hello?

22:37.389 --> 22:39.584
I guess we could bet
one more time.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.825
-Is Rachel having the baby?
-How did you know that?

22:45.731 --> 22:48.962
-Joey! Chandler!
-They're at the coffee house.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.635
You know everything!

22:51.870 --> 22:55.237
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

22:56.475 --> 23:00.206
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.

23:00.379 --> 23:04.145
-We know it's a girl.
-I'll give you really good odds.
