WEBVTT

00:04.637 --> 00:06.036
-Hi!
-Hey!

00:06.206 --> 00:09.642
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

00:09.809 --> 00:12.710
About twenty. Couple people
from work had something else to do.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.847
Your sisters called and can't make it.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.710
What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event..

00:17.884 --> 00:22.150
where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.289
I don't care, as long as my mom's here.

00:24.724 --> 00:28.455
-Oh, my God. Your mother.
-What? My mom's not gonna be here?

00:28.661 --> 00:33.291
Well, given that we forgot to invite her,
it would be a big coincidence if she was.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.724
My God!

00:35.935 --> 00:38.699
Phoebe was in charge
of the invitations.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.602
I don't have a mother.
So often I forget..

00:41.808 --> 00:44.174
Oh, give it a rest.

00:44.444 --> 00:47.572
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

00:47.747 --> 00:49.112
No.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.415
Neither is mine.

00:52.619 --> 00:57.079
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.784
Make sure she comes.
It's important. It's my mom.

01:00.994 --> 01:04.088
-I know. What's her number?
-I don't know.

01:04.297 --> 01:07.289
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.842
If you're in charge of invitations,
why am I calling her?

01:17.010 --> 01:20.104
Hello, Mrs. Green!
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.940
-Oh, hello, Monica.
-Hi.

01:22.148 --> 01:26.016
It's last-minute, but we've decided
to throw an impromptu..

01:26.252 --> 01:30.154
-baby shower for Rachel today.
-My daughters told me..

01:30.323 --> 01:34.987
when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

01:35.161 --> 01:38.756
-Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-For what, dear?

01:38.965 --> 01:41.991
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

01:42.168 --> 01:46.264
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.600
I'm sorry for everything.
Really, I mean..

01:48.775 --> 01:51.141
there's a lot of planning
in a baby shower.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.007
You know, things get
overlooked and..

01:54.981 --> 01:56.414
Phoebe's mother killed herself.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.847
Why? Did you forget
to invite her too?

02:01.888 --> 02:04.049
Oh, you're so funny.

02:05.358 --> 02:09.522
Please, please, can you come?
It starts at 4:00.

02:10.530 --> 02:14.159
-Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.
-Thank you.

02:15.168 --> 02:20.128
-Isn't it at 3?
-Son of a bitch!

02:57.577 --> 02:59.408
Hey, Joe! Wanna shoot some hoops?

02:59.579 --> 03:02.377
And for the record, I am not
covering the tall one this time.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.177
Fine, but she's not that tall.

03:05.985 --> 03:10.012
I can't go. I'm practicing. I got an audition
to be the host of a new game show.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.248
-Cool!
-Great!

03:11.491 --> 03:14.654
If I get it, by day
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

03:14.827 --> 03:18.854
But by night I'll be Joey Tribbiani!

03:19.499 --> 03:21.967
You'll be perfect for this!
That's already your name!

03:22.135 --> 03:23.363
I know. I know.

03:23.536 --> 03:27.165
It'd be great if I got this because you
never know what could happen on a soap.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.240
But I could be
a game-show host forever.

03:29.409 --> 03:34.346
Like that Bob Barker guy. He's been doing
The Price is Right for 75 years.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.309
I bet the ratings weren't good
for the first 25.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.383
You know, before there was television.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.685
But the problem,
this game is really complicated.

03:43.856 --> 03:46.620
Come on. You said the same thing
about Hungry Hungry Hippos.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.624
And last week, you beat Ben.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.923
Yeah. I have to be
honest with you guys.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.861
He kind of let me win.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.834
The audition's in a couple hours,
and I don't understand the game.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.434
Do you want some help?

03:59.639 --> 04:04.269
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

04:04.477 --> 04:07.913
We can lose to junior-high girls
some other time.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.314
All right. Let's play Bamboozled!

04:11.484 --> 04:13.452
-Bamboozled?
-Yeah. Isn't that a cool name?

04:13.620 --> 04:14.848
-Yeah!
-No!

04:15.021 --> 04:19.355
All right. Okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.754
Tell us about yourself, Ross.

04:21.928 --> 04:26.627
Well, I'm a paleontologist.
I live in New York.

04:26.799 --> 04:31.702
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And..

04:32.005 --> 04:35.338
I said, a little bit, Ross.
How about you, Chandler?

04:35.508 --> 04:39.535
I'm a headhunter. I hook up
out-of-work Soviet scientists..

04:39.712 --> 04:43.011
with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.879
Excellent! Let's play!
Chandler, you'll go first.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.884
-What is the capital of Colombia?
-Bogota.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.149
It's Bogota, but close enough.

04:54.193 --> 04:58.721
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.992
-What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
-I should know that.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.502
Let's see. One moment, please..

05:06.673 --> 05:12.976
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines if you go higher or lower.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.478
Higher or lower than what?

05:16.249 --> 05:20.982
-This is embarrassing!
-Can you believe how lame this is?

05:21.154 --> 05:26.524
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

05:30.196 --> 05:34.189
I told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

05:35.435 --> 05:38.734
You ordered a stripper for the shower?
That is inappropriate.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.736
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.538
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.

05:46.746 --> 05:51.513
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.242
Try.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.217
There's my little girl!

05:56.923 --> 05:59.050
-She's still mad.
-Yeah, I know.

05:59.225 --> 06:02.456
Isn't it great? One less
person to make small talk with.

06:02.628 --> 06:03.754
Hey, how are you?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.795
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.828
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?

06:12.038 --> 06:15.735
We've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.672
You hate it when people
are mad at you..

06:18.845 --> 06:21.973
but you just have
to be okay with it.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.481
Okay. I can do that.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.916
-I gotta go powder my ass.
-Oh.

06:29.188 --> 06:32.214
Look at that face! Just like when
you were in high school.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.829
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were a cheerleader in trouble.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.691
-Come, let's get some tea.
-Okay.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.028
Oh, my! Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

06:42.201 --> 06:46.934
Did you pick a nanny? If you use your
housekeeper, it will split her focus.

06:47.106 --> 06:51.736
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And I don't have a housekeeper.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.936
It's like you're a cave person.

06:55.381 --> 06:59.784
You must get a nanny. You don't
know how overwhelming it will be.

06:59.952 --> 07:03.251
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.

07:03.456 --> 07:07.517
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

07:07.693 --> 07:10.423
I actually think
I remember some of it.

07:10.596 --> 07:14.396
Tu madre esta loca.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.598
Such a sweet woman.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.364
And more important,
she became a part of our family.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.668
That's right, Mrs. K.
What did that K stand for?

07:23.843 --> 07:26.107
I have no idea, dear.
She was the nanny.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.781
As great as she was,
I can't afford that.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.951
I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget
not everyone has alimony.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.986
-Oh, Rachel!
-What?

07:38.157 --> 07:42.116
I just had a great idea!
I'm gonna come live with you!

07:42.795 --> 07:44.786
What? What?

07:44.997 --> 07:49.661
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

07:49.836 --> 07:53.294
Look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.638
Yes, yes, I do.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.778
Ross, you're in the lead.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.279
Would you like to take another question
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

08:04.484 --> 08:08.215
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.218
I'll take another question.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.584
Okay. This is gonna be tough.
Hold your breath.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.555
It's okay. I'm ready.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.696
You gotta hold your breath
until you answer.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.889
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his..

08:22.235 --> 08:28.504
Okay. What do you have a fear of if
you suffer from this phobia? Triska..

08:28.674 --> 08:32.770
Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk..

08:32.945 --> 08:35.413
Look at this. How do you say that?

08:35.581 --> 08:38.675
-Let me see that.
-This one right here.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.552
-Triskaidekaphobia.
-Fear of Triscuits!

08:42.722 --> 08:47.125
-No! No. Fear of the number 13.
-Fear of Triscuits?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.761
It's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.598
Chandler, you're up.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.394
I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass
for a free turn.

08:57.670 --> 09:01.572
Yes, yes. But you can only use
it once, so choose wisely.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.069
This is tricky.

09:05.077 --> 09:09.741
I mean, I am in the lead, but I would
love another shot at the Golden Monkey.

09:10.950 --> 09:15.250
-This game makes no sense!
-You're upset because you're losing.

09:15.454 --> 09:19.390
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.961
I would like to hang
on to my Angel Pass please.

09:23.262 --> 09:27.028
You can either spin the Wheel
or pick a Google Card.

09:27.199 --> 09:30.794
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, I don't care.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.433
You must choose.

09:34.607 --> 09:38.976
-Either. It makes no difference.
-Choose, you jackass.

09:39.979 --> 09:43.312
-I'll take a card.
-You picked the Gimme Card!

09:43.482 --> 09:46.918
-You get all of Ross' points!
-What?

09:47.653 --> 09:50.315
This game is kind of fun!

09:50.489 --> 09:53.617
You don't think it's crazy that
you get my points..?

09:53.826 --> 09:57.785
The contestants aren't supposed
to speak to each other.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.594
Now, do you wanna start
opening presents..

10:02.768 --> 10:05.532
because it seems like people
are getting itchy to leave.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.332
And when I say people,
I mean me.

10:10.843 --> 10:14.301
-Why did you invite my mother?
-What?

10:14.480 --> 10:17.779
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.349
-For how long?
-Eight weeks.

10:20.519 --> 10:25.081
I love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.283
I'd be honored if she wanted
to live with me.

10:28.494 --> 10:31.019
She can't hear you.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.859
What am I gonna do?

10:34.066 --> 10:37.900
If you don't want her to move
in with you, just tell her.

10:38.070 --> 10:41.039
You're right.
I'm about to have a baby.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.404
I can say I don't want
her sleeping on my couch.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.876
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.
This can't happen.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.308
That is right.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.280
Tell her you don't want her
to live with you.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.817
Do not take no for an answer.

10:55.755 --> 11:00.419
This is great! Now she's
gonna be mad at Rachel!

11:00.593 --> 11:05.724
And I'm just gonna swoop in there and
be like the daughter she never had.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.627
Oh, honey, you have
to let it go.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.299
Okay.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.131
Who doesn't accept an apology?

11:14.306 --> 11:15.864
I mean, it's just so simple.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.306
"I'm sorry, Sandra."
"That's okay, Monica.

11:18.477 --> 11:19.637
I forgive you.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.643
And by the way, you're very pretty."

11:23.683 --> 11:28.086
I have new respect for Chandler.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.620
All right, everybody!
It's time to open the presents!

11:32.792 --> 11:35.761
Yes! The first gift
that Rachel opens..

11:35.961 --> 11:38.395
should be from the grandmother.

11:38.564 --> 11:44.503
Because you're the most important
person in this room! And in the world!

11:44.970 --> 11:48.064
I don't have a gift because I wasn't
invited until the last minute.

11:48.240 --> 11:53.268
But thank you so much, dear, for
bringing that to everybody's attention.

11:55.281 --> 11:59.843
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents!

12:00.820 --> 12:04.688
-It's okay that you didn't get a gift.
-I kind of did.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.257
Me! Eight weeks of me.

12:07.426 --> 12:11.260
Okay. See, Mom,
the truth is, I can do this on my own.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.194
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.301
But you need help at the beginning.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.165
I know what I'm doing.
I can handle it.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.170
Really? Remember Twinkles?

12:22.374 --> 12:26.333
He was a hamster.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

12:26.512 --> 12:29.845
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time!

12:30.015 --> 12:33.007
You're the glue holding
this party together.

12:33.185 --> 12:36.484
It's kind of falling apart here.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.850
-Oh, look!
-Wow!

12:39.024 --> 12:40.889
This is from your friends at work.

12:41.060 --> 12:46.623
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
Oh, I know what this is.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.630
Wait a minute.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.770
That can't be right.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.568
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

12:56.542 --> 12:58.874
Darling, that's a breast pump.

13:00.179 --> 13:05.811
Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.576
Oh, wow! What's this?

13:08.821 --> 13:12.222
-It's a Diaper Genie.
-It dispenses clean diapers!

13:12.424 --> 13:14.483
It's where you put dirty ones.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.694
Why don't you take it outside
and throw it in a dumpster?

13:18.864 --> 13:23.892
-You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
-What, it goes 10 times a day?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.594
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

13:27.206 --> 13:29.936
No, dear. That's what babies do.

13:30.209 --> 13:34.543
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

13:35.614 --> 13:40.449
What will you do with the baby
while you trot out to the garbage?

13:41.053 --> 13:44.614
I don't know,
I'd leave it on the changing table?

13:44.857 --> 13:49.851
-What? What did I do? What did I do?
-You can't leave a baby alone.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.758
Of course, I know that!

13:51.931 --> 13:54.798
Of course you never leave
a baby alone.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.401
It would..
She wouldn't be safe.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.773
Not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy.

14:01.941 --> 14:05.775
Opening the presents is a little
overwhelming right now.

14:05.945 --> 14:09.381
I'm gonna maybe open
them all a little bit later.

14:09.548 --> 14:12.073
Thank you for coming,
for the gifts..

14:12.251 --> 14:17.712
-and this basket is beautiful.
-It's actually a bassinet.

14:17.957 --> 14:21.120
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

14:22.962 --> 14:27.160
In what film would you hear this line:
"We don't need no stinking badges!"

14:27.366 --> 14:30.301
-Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
-Correct! Backwards Bonus.

14:30.469 --> 14:34.030
-Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
-Yes!

14:34.206 --> 14:36.037
What? There's extra points for that?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.903
Fair not that's!

14:38.611 --> 14:41.409
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance
to the Golden Mud Hut!

14:41.580 --> 14:43.912
-Wise choice. How many rungs?
-Six!

14:45.150 --> 14:49.553
-That noise can only mean one thing.
-Hungry Monkey!

14:50.189 --> 14:53.955
-I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
-It's an audio question.

14:54.126 --> 14:57.892
Name this television theme song:

14:59.431 --> 15:02.366
Oh, my God. I know this.
Give me a second.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.593
-Tell it to the Time Turtle!
-Shut up!

15:04.770 --> 15:06.897
-"I Dream of Jeannie"!
-Yes! Back in the lead!

15:07.072 --> 15:09.370
I'd like to spin the Wheel.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.942
Oh, come on!

15:17.116 --> 15:18.811
Super Speedy Speed Round.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.782
-Is there a Hopping Bonus?
-Of course.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.487
-Who invented bifocals?
-Ben Franklin!

15:27.660 --> 15:30.493
Correct. Which monarch ruled
Great Britain the longest?

15:30.729 --> 15:31.957
Queen Victoria!

15:32.164 --> 15:36.396
You forgot to switch legs between
questions. No Hopping Bonus!

15:36.568 --> 15:38.763
Every time!

15:38.938 --> 15:42.931
-Yeah. Now over to Chandler.
-I'd like a Google Card.

15:43.108 --> 15:47.807
-Are you sure?
-Yes! No! Google!

15:49.381 --> 15:53.147
Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross!
Because, Chandler..

15:53.319 --> 15:55.480
-you've been Bamboozled!
-No!

15:55.688 --> 16:01.092
-Yes!
-This is the best game ever!

16:01.827 --> 16:04.295
You'll stay as long as I need you?

16:04.463 --> 16:07.125
-Of course.
-I swear I'm not an idiot.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.291
I read books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

16:10.536 --> 16:14.802
I didn't think to read about what
to do when the baby comes.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.669
And the baby's coming..

16:16.842 --> 16:21.939
and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

16:22.114 --> 16:25.174
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.611
-Where you going?
-I'm going to the bathroom.

16:28.821 --> 16:33.622
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.655
It is gonna be okay!

16:40.799 --> 16:42.960
Worth a shot.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.706
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

16:47.973 --> 16:50.441
I just Bamboozled Chandler!

16:53.512 --> 16:55.844
Which is not a sexual thing.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.980
-Well, that was a quick shower.
-Not if you were here.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.354
Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.321
We did. My mom got
us the greatest gift of all.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.494
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

17:10.662 --> 17:14.758
No. She's going to live
with us for eight weeks.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.399
What?

17:16.602 --> 17:20.402
Yes! She's gonna help us
take care of the baby!

17:21.340 --> 17:23.433
You're not serious!

17:23.609 --> 17:27.841
She's a very nice woman,
but we can't take eight weeks of her.

17:28.013 --> 17:30.208
-She'll drive us crazy..
-Hi, Ross!

17:30.382 --> 17:32.577
Hey, roomie!

17:38.557 --> 17:41.720
Hey, I'm Ray.
I'm the producer of the show.

17:41.927 --> 17:45.055
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

17:45.230 --> 17:49.496
This is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help with the audition.

17:49.701 --> 17:53.694
-Right, Ray.
-Whenever you're ready.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.434
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!

17:58.644 --> 18:03.274
Erin, first question. In hockey,
who is known as "The Great One"?

18:03.482 --> 18:04.710
-Gretzky.
-Correct!

18:04.917 --> 18:08.785
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel?

18:09.021 --> 18:12.218
Didn't your agents give
you the revised rules?

18:12.391 --> 18:15.451
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.618
Why?

18:17.796 --> 18:21.960
It was too complicated.
People didn't follow it.

18:22.134 --> 18:26.127
Complicated?! Spin the Wheel
to go up the Ladder of Chance..

18:26.305 --> 18:29.638
through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.971
You yank his tail,
and you're in Paradise Pond!

18:33.612 --> 18:35.842
Yeah. All that's gone.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.108
It's a simple
question-and-answer game now.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.513
Well, what's fun about that?

18:41.687 --> 18:46.181
You expect me to host a boring game
of people answering questions?

18:46.425 --> 18:49.155
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.296
Let's play Bamboozled!

18:52.598 --> 18:55.624
So I thought we'd put the
changing station in the living room.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.235
I thought I'd bring in my decorator
because I feel like I'm at my best..

18:59.404 --> 19:01.338
when surrounded by jewel tones.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.899
Sure, who doesn't?

19:06.245 --> 19:09.703
Oh, and all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have..

19:09.915 --> 19:12.110
they might be more at home
in the garage.

19:12.417 --> 19:17.787
-Well, we don't have a garage.
-Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

19:18.957 --> 19:23.951
You know what? Maybe it's not
absolutely vital that you live with us.

19:24.129 --> 19:29.658
-Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
-I really do. I don't know anything.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.729
I'm sure that's not true.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.770
Oh, no?
Do I know anything about babies?

19:34.940 --> 19:38.000
-No. Not a thing.
-It's frightening.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.303
Even if she doesn't
know anything, I do.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.607
And I'll be there to show her.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.951
That's exactly what
Rachel's father told me.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.349
Know what he said
at the first 3 a.m. feeding?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.751
"I'm tired. You take care of it."

19:51.924 --> 19:54.552
Which I later said to him
when he wanted to have sex.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.928
Well, I'm not Rachel's dad.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.534
And no offense,
but he's an ass.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.938
I do like you, Ross.

20:09.441 --> 20:13.002
I have a son. His mother
and I didn't live together.

20:13.178 --> 20:17.706
When he was with me, I took
care of him all the time, by myself.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.046
-That's true. You do have another child.
-Yeah.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.017
With another woman.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.555
Have you no control, Ross?

20:28.560 --> 20:31.051
That's a different issue.

20:31.563 --> 20:36.432
The point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her..

20:36.602 --> 20:38.968
and bathe her and change her.

20:39.137 --> 20:42.470
I want to do all those things.

20:42.641 --> 20:47.237
-You don't need me to live with you.
-Yes!

20:47.980 --> 20:51.416
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

20:51.883 --> 20:55.910
-You'll be a great father.
-You'll be a wonderful grandma.

20:56.288 --> 21:00.281
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing!

21:00.492 --> 21:03.791
Every first-time mother
feels that way.

21:03.962 --> 21:09.958
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city..

21:10.135 --> 21:15.471
you were a spoiled, helpless little
girl who used Daddy's credit cards!

21:15.907 --> 21:18.671
I hope you're going
somewhere with this.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.675
Look at you.
You're this big executive.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.609
You are more capable
than you give yourself credit for.

21:24.816 --> 21:28.946
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

21:29.187 --> 21:32.315
-Really?
-I'm telling you.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.123
Thank you.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.930
All right. I'm gonna get going.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.456
No, sweetheart, stay put.

21:42.668 --> 21:47.765
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm
not here. Which I almost wasn't.

21:48.807 --> 21:54.040
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

21:54.413 --> 21:58.281
Nothing. You have apologized
to her, like, a million times.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.544
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

22:01.787 --> 22:07.020
You just threw her daughter a lovely,
albeit slightly boring, shower.

22:07.192 --> 22:12.289
-And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
-You know what? You're right.

22:12.531 --> 22:15.659
If you wanna say anything,
I'd tell her off.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.301
Really?

22:18.737 --> 22:21.035
Okay, I will.

22:21.239 --> 22:23.571
Mrs. Green?

22:23.842 --> 22:25.309
Mrs. Green?

22:25.477 --> 22:28.378
It is rude to leave a party without saying
goodbye to the host.

22:28.580 --> 22:33.415
When someone apologizes to you,
the decent thing to do is to accept it.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.849
What I did wasn't on purpose.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.684
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.222
-Spiteful?
-That's right.

22:41.460 --> 22:45.362
It's time you took a good
look in the mirror, young lady!

22:45.530 --> 22:47.259
Old lady!

22:47.466 --> 22:49.263
Lady!

22:49.468 --> 22:52.335
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

22:53.205 --> 22:57.198
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.708
Good day.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.608
I can't feel my legs!

23:05.384 --> 23:08.285
You were fantastic!
I'm so proud of you.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.515
-Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
-You should be.

23:12.758 --> 23:17.195
-Could you get me something to drink?
-You got it!

23:17.362 --> 23:22.231
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!
I apologize. If you..

23:23.635 --> 23:26.900
Okay! I bit my tongue!

23:27.072 --> 23:30.405
But I'm still really sorry!

23:36.381 --> 23:38.440
-Okay, I'm ready.
-You sure?

23:38.650 --> 23:41.585
I've done my studying,
and I know my stuff.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.947
All right, then.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.257
Rachel Green,
let's play Bamboozled!

23:48.894 --> 23:51.624
How do you test the temperature
of the baby's bath water?

23:51.830 --> 23:53.923
-Put your elbow in it.
-Excellent!

23:54.132 --> 23:58.330
-How do you put a baby down for a nap?
-Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.

23:58.503 --> 23:59.731
Correct!

23:59.905 --> 24:02.931
There's a hopping bonus here,
but I don't suggest you take it.

24:03.308 --> 24:04.536
Okay.

24:05.076 --> 24:10.708
This is an audio question. What do
you do when a baby makes this sound:

24:14.085 --> 24:16.679
Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.

24:16.888 --> 24:21.825
Excellent! Now do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

24:22.060 --> 24:25.461
-A card! A card! I pick a card!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

24:25.630 --> 24:30.829
You've been Bamboozled!
You're gonna be a terrible mother!

24:32.804 --> 24:35.500
I've lost sight of why we're doing this!

24:38.009 --> 24:40.170
Please don't walk away.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.548
I've gone too far.
