WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.365
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Phoebe.

00:06.639 --> 00:08.903
- How did it go?
- Not so good.

00:09.109 --> 00:12.306
He walked me home and said,
"Let's do this again."

00:13.246 --> 00:16.238
He said, "Let's do this again."
That's good, right?

00:16.449 --> 00:21.716
Translated, "Let's do this again"
means, "You'll never see me naked."

00:22.889 --> 00:24.151
Since when?

00:24.591 --> 00:27.754
Since always.
It's, like, dating language.

00:27.961 --> 00:31.124
Like, "It's not you"
means, "It is you."

00:32.565 --> 00:36.228
"You're nice" means, "I'll be
dating alcoholics..

00:36.436 --> 00:38.666
and complaining
about them to you."

00:39.539 --> 00:42.030
"We should see
other people" means:

00:42.275 --> 00:43.902
"Ha-ha, I already am!"

00:45.445 --> 00:46.810
Everybody knows this?

00:47.847 --> 00:48.973
Cushions the blow.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.377
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep..

00:51.651 --> 00:53.983
and saying it went to a farm.

00:54.187 --> 00:57.281
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did..

00:58.024 --> 01:01.323
send our dog off to live on a farm.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.094
Ross?

01:04.597 --> 01:07.361
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.967
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.730
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.372
And it was..

01:17.444 --> 01:19.708
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

01:22.015 --> 01:24.950
The One With the Thumb

02:12.765 --> 02:15.700
How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?

02:15.902 --> 02:19.201
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

02:19.405 --> 02:24.240
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.675
That was really good!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.542
Thanks. Let's keep going.

02:29.749 --> 02:33.742
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

02:36.189 --> 02:40.216
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

02:40.426 --> 02:42.451
Smoke away!

02:55.375 --> 02:58.776
I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.972
- What?
- Relax your hand.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.979
Let your wrist go.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.811
Not so much!

03:07.187 --> 03:09.519
All right. Now take a puff.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.547
Right.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.821
- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you a cigarette.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.932
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.303
When you hold it,
you feel right.

03:31.744 --> 03:32.904
You feel complete.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.175
- You miss it?
- No, not so much.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.510
All right. Now we smoke.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.647
Oh, my God!

03:45.992 --> 03:47.892
- Give me that!
- No. You've got options.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.686
You can smoke like this:

03:49.896 --> 03:52.126
- Chandler
- Or hold it in your mouth.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.731
Give me the cigarette!

03:53.933 --> 03:55.423
- You try.
- Thank you.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.830
Okay, how's this?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.636
Okay, that's not bad.

04:02.842 --> 04:06.972
All right, when you're finished,
it's cool if you flick it.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.944
All right, you keep practicing..

04:12.151 --> 04:14.881
and I'll go put out the sofa.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.955
I thought it was foot size.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.994
No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb..

04:25.198 --> 04:28.031
to the tip of his index finger.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.140
That's ridiculous.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.842
Can I use either thumb?

04:39.646 --> 04:41.876
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

04:42.081 --> 04:45.175
All right. Don't tell me.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.084
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.454
Coffee, black.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.556
Latte.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.994
And an iced tea.

04:58.665 --> 05:01.691
- I'm getting good at this.
- Excellent!

05:01.901 --> 05:03.232
Good for me!

05:17.083 --> 05:19.711
- You okay, Phoebe?
- It's not worth

05:19.919 --> 05:21.409
It's my bank.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.885
- What did they do?
- It's nothing

05:24.090 --> 05:27.719
I get my mail and
open their monthly "statement."

05:27.927 --> 05:29.622
Easy!

05:31.397 --> 05:34.161
And there's $500 extra in my account.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.964
Satan's minions at work again!

05:38.271 --> 05:40.739
Now I have to go deal with them

05:40.940 --> 05:44.933
- What are you talking about? Keep it!
- It's not mine.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.975
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.741
But if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

05:52.785 --> 05:55.379
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

05:55.588 --> 06:00.548
Know what I'd hear with every step?
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

06:00.760 --> 06:04.025
Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

06:04.230 --> 06:06.960
"Not-not mine. Not-not mine."

06:07.166 --> 06:08.827
We're with you. We got it.

06:10.069 --> 06:14.130
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.399
Chandler, what are you doing?

06:16.943 --> 06:19.002
What are you doing?

06:21.314 --> 06:24.044
Oh, gross!

06:24.350 --> 06:26.875
- What is this?
- I'm smoking!

06:27.086 --> 06:29.611
You've been so good for three years!

06:29.822 --> 06:32.916
And this is my reward.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.923
Think about what you went
through when you quit.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.691
Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

06:40.900 --> 06:43.130
So this time I won't quit.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.804
- Put it out!
- I'm putting it out!

06:47.039 --> 06:48.404
Oh, no!

06:48.608 --> 06:51.008
I can't drink this now.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.040
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.718
With Alan again?
How's it going?

06:59.919 --> 07:04.049
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.122
When do we get to meet him?

07:06.325 --> 07:08.190
Let's see, it's Monday..

07:08.394 --> 07:10.055
- Never.
- Come on!

07:10.263 --> 07:12.390
Not after what happened with Steve.

07:12.598 --> 07:17.092
What do you mean?
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

07:20.173 --> 07:21.162
Sorry.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.434
I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.475
Then can we meet him?

07:26.679 --> 07:27.668
No.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.507
Sorry.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.115
Joey. Let it go.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.122
Why should they meet him?

07:40.526 --> 07:43.256
I bring a guy home and they're like..

07:43.796 --> 07:47.232
coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

07:47.934 --> 07:52.337
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef..

07:52.538 --> 07:56.338
I'll tell you,
that is not such a terrible thing.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.033
Your friends are just
looking after you.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.578
I wish that once I'd date a guy
they liked.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.377
You realize the odds of that
happening are slimmer..

08:06.586 --> 08:10.147
- if they never get to meet the guy.
- I know.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.621
- Can't I whimper a little bit?
- Whimper.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.428
Okay, I'm done.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.059
Let it go, Ross.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.563
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.404
- Do you all promise?
- We promise.

08:29.609 --> 08:30.633
We'll be good.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.244
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

08:41.554 --> 08:45.752
You can come in, but your
filter-tip buddy stays outside!

08:55.401 --> 08:58.495
"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.

08:58.704 --> 09:02.936
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience..

09:03.142 --> 09:06.134
and hope you'll accept
this football phone..

09:09.315 --> 09:11.476
as our gift."
Do you believe it?

09:11.684 --> 09:14.847
Now I have $ 1000
and a football phone.

09:16.455 --> 09:19.515
What bank is this?

09:19.725 --> 09:22.250
Okay, it's him.

09:23.429 --> 09:24.623
- Who is it?
- Alan.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.559
Chandler! He's here!

09:29.669 --> 09:30.727
Do I look okay?

09:31.437 --> 09:32.870
One more button.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.937
Closed! How about closed?

09:36.042 --> 09:38.067
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.107
Please be good.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.112
Remember how much you all like me?

09:45.685 --> 09:50.088
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.325
I've heard so much about
all you guys.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.833
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.839
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.674
Who's gonna take the first shot?

10:17.783 --> 10:19.080
Come on!

10:19.986 --> 10:21.817
I'll go.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.389
Let's start with how he
kept picking

10:26.592 --> 10:29.891
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We loved him.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.961
We loved him!

10:32.164 --> 10:35.895
Wait! We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

10:36.102 --> 10:37.569
That pimento trick!

10:37.770 --> 10:41.069
I'll never look at an olive
the same way again.

10:41.273 --> 10:42.763
And did you notice?

10:47.947 --> 10:50.939
Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.086
- Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
- What shoe?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.888
From the rhyme.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.955
There was a man
With a crooked smile

11:00.159 --> 11:03.686
Who lived in a shoe
For a while

11:06.232 --> 11:08.496
So I think Alan..

11:08.701 --> 11:12.865
is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends will be measured.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.266
Future boyfriends?

11:14.473 --> 11:17.738
- I think this could be "it."
- Really?

11:17.943 --> 11:21.811
I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.881
You know I'll be doing that
at parties.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.048
- Know what I like most?
- What?

11:31.791 --> 11:35.124
The way he makes me feel about myself.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.375
How was the game?

11:59.585 --> 12:01.052
Well..

12:01.253 --> 12:03.778
We won!

12:04.690 --> 12:07.454
Fantastic! Question.
How is that possible?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.758
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable!

12:10.963 --> 12:14.660
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny plays every position.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.099
It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan..

12:22.508 --> 12:25.341
It was like he made us into a team.

12:25.544 --> 12:30.481
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.449
Can I ask a question?

12:33.652 --> 12:35.984
Do you think Alan is sometimes..

12:36.188 --> 12:37.177
What?

12:37.389 --> 12:40.017
I don't know. A little too "Alan"?

12:40.226 --> 12:43.753
Oh, no. Not possible.
You can never be too "Alan."

12:43.963 --> 12:48.764
It's his innate "Alan-ness"
that we adore.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.960
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.936
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, weird girl.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.283
- I brought alphabet soup.
- Pick out the vowels?

13:05.484 --> 13:08.453
I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y."

13:09.822 --> 13:12.188
- And something else.
- Saltines?

13:12.391 --> 13:14.723
No, $1000 and a football phone.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.724
What?

13:17.730 --> 13:19.391
Oh, my God!

13:19.598 --> 13:22.328
- There's really money in here.
- I know.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.230
What are you doing?

13:24.436 --> 13:28.065
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

13:28.274 --> 13:31.368
- I have to give you something.
- No, you don't

13:31.577 --> 13:35.172
- Do you want my tinfoil hat?
- No, you need that.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.111
- It's okay. Thanks.
- Let me do something.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.611
I'll tell you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.352
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.777
Keep the change.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.013
Thanks, Lizzy.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.383
Want a pretzel?

14:52.658 --> 14:55.559
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.866
A thumb?

15:07.106 --> 15:10.166
I know. There it was,
just floating..

15:10.376 --> 15:13.868
like this tiny little hitchhiker.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.774
Maybe it's a contest.
Like "collect all five."

15:20.019 --> 15:22.852
- Does anyone wanna see?
- No, thanks!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.349
Don't do that. Come on!

15:26.558 --> 15:29.220
It's worse than the thumb.

15:30.462 --> 15:33.260
- This is so unfair.
- Why is it unfair?

15:33.465 --> 15:36.263
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

15:36.468 --> 15:39.096
Joey's knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

15:39.305 --> 15:41.466
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

15:41.674 --> 15:47.271
Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

15:48.247 --> 15:52.684
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

15:58.757 --> 16:02.955
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

16:05.831 --> 16:07.628
I could live without it.

16:10.469 --> 16:15.702
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like
when Phoebe chews her hair?

16:18.077 --> 16:21.205
Don't listen to him.
I think it's endearing.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.643
Oh, you do, do you?

16:29.855 --> 16:32.983
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.952
Indeed there isn't.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.892
I should get back to work.

16:40.099 --> 16:43.762
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

16:45.938 --> 16:50.034
The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

17:04.323 --> 17:08.089
Ever go out with a guy
your friends really like?

17:08.293 --> 17:10.022
No.

17:12.398 --> 17:15.663
I'm going out with a guy
my friends really like.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.894
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

17:19.104 --> 17:22.904
All right! A cow got through.

17:23.642 --> 17:24.904
Can you believe it?

17:25.110 --> 17:26.771
It's just, you know what?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.777
I just don't feel the "thing."

17:29.982 --> 17:32.610
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

17:32.818 --> 17:37.619
Honey, you should always
feel the thing.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.660
If that's how you feel about the guy,
dump him.

17:43.862 --> 17:47.298
- It's gonna be really hard.
- He'll get over it.

17:47.499 --> 17:52.527
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

17:52.805 --> 17:56.866
- Don't you respect your body?
- Don't you see what you're doing?

17:57.076 --> 18:01.012
I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

18:01.413 --> 18:05.611
The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.951
Alan wants to speak to you.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.351
Really? He does?

18:14.293 --> 18:17.023
Hey, buddy! What's up?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.455
She told you about that, huh?

18:21.366 --> 18:25.496
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.305
It's not that

18:30.242 --> 18:32.176
Well, that's true.

18:34.513 --> 18:38.711
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
like that before.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.511
Well, okay. Thanks.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.491
God, he's good.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.829
- If only he were a woman.
- Yeah.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.269
Lamb Chop!

19:04.476 --> 19:07.673
How old is that sock?

19:07.980 --> 19:12.280
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

19:14.186 --> 19:18.748
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.092
- Where's Joey?
- Joey ate my last stick of gum..

19:25.297 --> 19:27.390
so I killed him.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.960
Do you think that was wrong?

19:31.470 --> 19:34.268
- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.867
There you go.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.110
I'm alive with pleasure now.

19:40.312 --> 19:44.078
Phoebe, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

19:45.284 --> 19:48.151
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

19:49.655 --> 19:51.452
Hey, I might.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.882
I'm sorry.

19:54.092 --> 19:58.552
The soda people gave me $7000
for the thumb.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.163
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.065
What is up with the universe?

20:06.271 --> 20:10.367
- What's going on?
- It's just nice when we're together.

20:10.576 --> 20:14.068
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.483
Please, guys, we have to talk.

20:26.692 --> 20:29.422
Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.754
No, I'm not.

20:33.532 --> 20:36.501
- We have to talk.
- There it is!

20:39.204 --> 20:41.001
Okay, it's about Alan.

20:41.206 --> 20:45.666
Speaking of which, tell him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

20:45.944 --> 20:50.210
Before you get into that,
there's something you should know.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.650
There's really no easy way
to say this.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.219
I've decided to break up with Alan.

21:02.828 --> 21:05.490
Is there somebody else?

21:07.399 --> 21:09.299
No, it's just..

21:09.501 --> 21:12.436
you know, things change.
People change.

21:12.638 --> 21:15.004
We didn't change.

21:17.242 --> 21:20.370
So that's it? It's over?

21:20.812 --> 21:22.905
Just like that?

21:24.049 --> 21:29.180
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and..

21:32.324 --> 21:34.485
- I can go on pretending
- Okay!

21:34.693 --> 21:35.751
No.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.089
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,
or to you.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.289
Well, who wants fair?

21:41.500 --> 21:45.698
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

21:47.673 --> 21:51.871
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.669
I can't believe this!

21:54.880 --> 21:59.943
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.687
I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.049
Yeah, right!

22:09.895 --> 22:13.456
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- We'll be fine.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.259
We're just gonna need a little time.

22:17.202 --> 22:19.397
I understand.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.544
- Wow.
- I'm really sorry.

22:26.745 --> 22:29.873
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

22:30.082 --> 22:33.415
- But I'm a little relieved.
- Relieved?

22:33.618 --> 22:37.281
Yeah, well, I mean,
I had a great time with you.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.724
I just can't stand your friends.

22:46.531 --> 22:50.331
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

22:51.970 --> 22:54.165
That was fun.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.142
He could row like a Viking.

23:06.518 --> 23:08.884
So how'd it go?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.117
You know.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.723
Did he mention us?

23:17.729 --> 23:20.926
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.664
- Rough day, huh?
- You have no idea.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.775
Come here.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.305
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
- No!

23:37.516 --> 23:39.814
I don't care! I'm weak!

23:40.018 --> 23:41.918
I've gotta have the smoke!

23:42.120 --> 23:45.817
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.855
Yeah, all right.
