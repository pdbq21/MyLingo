WEBVTT

00:03.139 --> 00:05.736
He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle

00:05.911 --> 00:08.906
And away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

00:09.084 --> 00:12.181
But I heard him exclaim
Ere he drove out of sight

00:12.357 --> 00:17.824
"Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night."

00:19.739 --> 00:25.011
Wow! That was great!
You really wrote that?

00:28.122 --> 00:30.958
Say goodbye, elves.
I'm off to Tulsa.

00:31.128 --> 00:33.462
I can't believe you won't be here
for Christmas.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.466
You're really not coming back?

00:35.638 --> 00:38.804
We have this paperwork that needs
to be filed by the end of the year.

00:39.044 --> 00:41.037
Why can't those dumb Tulsa people
do the work?

00:41.215 --> 00:43.812
Because those dumb people
got everything dumped on them..

00:43.987 --> 00:47.016
by the arrogant jerks
in the New York office.

00:47.194 --> 00:48.891
I'm caught between two worlds.

00:50.233 --> 00:52.898
- If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
- It's so unfair.

00:53.072 --> 00:56.101
- You don't even like your job.
- So. Who does?

00:56.312 --> 00:57.781
- I like my job.
- I love my job.

00:57.949 --> 01:01.046
- I can't wait to go back to work.
- I can't get enough dinosaurs.

01:05.463 --> 01:07.559
I'm sorry I won't be here.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.499
It's hard enough not seeing you
during the week..

01:10.674 --> 01:12.644
but for Christmas..

01:12.812 --> 01:14.975
If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

01:15.483 --> 01:17.511
Thanks.

01:17.688 --> 01:18.951
I'll see you New Year's Day.

01:19.324 --> 01:21.294
You're not gonna be here
New Year's Eve?

01:22.130 --> 01:25.570
- Did I not mention that?
- No.

01:25.838 --> 01:27.899
And to all a good night!

02:21.616 --> 02:24.782
All right, everybody.
I know it is Christmas Eve..

02:24.956 --> 02:28.326
and you'd rather be with family,
but there is no call for writing..

02:28.496 --> 02:33.131
"Screw you, Mr. Bing"
on the back of my chair.

02:33.507 --> 02:35.442
By the way,
you can all call me Chandler.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.143
- Hey.
- Hey. Where you been?

02:39.318 --> 02:42.655
I was checking out that insurance
company's Christmas party on three.

02:42.825 --> 02:46.059
It was really beautiful. They have
decorations and this huge tree.

02:46.231 --> 02:49.226
And I just thought,
to hell with them, we have to work.

02:49.404 --> 02:52.001
So I stole their ham.

02:53.112 --> 02:55.241
Hear that?
You may not be with your families..

02:55.416 --> 02:58.013
but at least it's gonna smell like ham
in here.

02:59.324 --> 03:01.385
My kid's in a play right now.

03:02.297 --> 03:04.598
You know what?
I know what will cheer you up.

03:04.769 --> 03:08.607
I had a talk with the boys in New York.
I told them about all your hard work..

03:08.777 --> 03:12.216
and that a little Christmas bonus
may be in order.

03:12.450 --> 03:17.860
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

03:20.333 --> 03:23.328
Well, that's like money in your pocket.

03:23.573 --> 03:25.839
All right, you want me to say it?
This sucks.

03:26.044 --> 03:28.446
Being here sucks. This work sucks!

03:28.650 --> 03:30.950
Now it feels like Christmas.

03:31.589 --> 03:33.251
I'm sorry.

03:33.459 --> 03:36.397
At least you get to go home
and be with your families tonight.

03:36.566 --> 03:39.093
I have to go to an empty hotel room
and lay down..

03:39.271 --> 03:42.733
on a very questionable bedspread.

03:43.212 --> 03:46.184
Then tomorrow, you get to have
Christmas in your own houses.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.788
Which, by the way,
none of you have invited me to.

03:49.024 --> 03:53.260
- You can come to my house.
- No, thanks.

03:55.136 --> 03:56.867
- It was a nice pep talk.
- Thanks.

03:57.073 --> 04:00.808
I'm actually thinking about becoming
a motivational speaker.

04:01.381 --> 04:05.253
So if you were home right now,
what would you be doing?

04:05.490 --> 04:09.761
Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.
Our holidays are pretty traditional.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.870
So here's a very special
holiday song..

04:13.038 --> 04:16.671
that I wrote for some
very important people to me.

05:11.121 --> 05:13.820
Happy holidays, everybody.

05:14.394 --> 05:16.957
Phoebe, look in the kitchen.
I'll look in the back closet.

05:17.133 --> 05:20.595
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

05:21.108 --> 05:23.305
Yeah. Chandler,
why don't you take a walk.

05:23.479 --> 05:25.415
This doesn't concern you.

05:26.318 --> 05:28.846
We are looking for
our Christmas presents from Monica.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.394
- What? That's terrible.
- No, no. We do it every year.

05:32.631 --> 05:35.067
Well, that makes it not terrible.

05:36.271 --> 05:40.713
No. Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us, that wily..

05:40.881 --> 05:42.213
minx.

05:43.085 --> 05:44.918
We're gonna search here
for an hour..

05:45.089 --> 05:47.389
and then we'll go to Joey's
and search. Okay?

05:47.561 --> 05:50.361
No, not okay.
You can't look for Monica's presents.

05:50.534 --> 05:52.400
- No, we have to.
- No, you don't have to.

05:52.571 --> 05:56.534
And you can't,
because I live here too.

05:56.779 --> 06:01.220
- Well, then you should look with us.
- Why?

06:01.388 --> 06:04.383
Aren't you worried about what
to get Monica for Christmas?

06:04.595 --> 06:06.792
No, I have a great idea
for a present for her.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.066
That's it? "A great idea"?

06:10.907 --> 06:13.674
That's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present..

06:13.847 --> 06:15.976
two medium presents
and lots of little presents..

06:16.151 --> 06:19.419
and you got her one great present?
That's gonna make her feel bad.

06:19.592 --> 06:22.358
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

06:24.100 --> 06:26.503
- If I helped, we could find them faster!
- Right.

06:29.110 --> 06:32.378
- We have a live one!
- It's a Macy's bag!

06:34.688 --> 06:37.181
Who's it for?

06:38.162 --> 06:42.536
"Dear Losers: Do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

06:44.073 --> 06:48.036
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

06:49.484 --> 06:51.717
Rach, these are for you.

06:52.390 --> 06:56.661
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

06:56.866 --> 07:01.000
No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

07:03.713 --> 07:06.810
Okay, Phoebe, your turn.

07:09.758 --> 07:11.751
Toilet seat covers!

07:14.902 --> 07:17.533
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

07:17.741 --> 07:20.211
You guys.

07:20.379 --> 07:24.753
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.

07:27.360 --> 07:32.462
- You got me a cola drink?
- And.. a lemon-lime!

07:33.272 --> 07:36.335
Well, this.. This is too much.

07:36.512 --> 07:39.415
I feel like I should get you
another sweater.

07:41.421 --> 07:44.393
And last but not least..

07:46.197 --> 07:49.602
They're ribbed, for your pleasure.

07:50.272 --> 07:52.208
Well, hey, Ben?

07:52.410 --> 07:58.617
What if the Holiday Armadillo
told you all about the Festival of Lights?

07:58.823 --> 08:00.314
Cool!

08:00.527 --> 08:02.223
Come on, Ben.

08:04.935 --> 08:11.471
Years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees!

08:12.249 --> 08:15.483
Merry Christmas!

08:17.026 --> 08:18.586
Santa!

08:20.265 --> 08:23.396
What are you doing here, Santa?

08:25.275 --> 08:28.179
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.576
What are you doing here..

08:30.754 --> 08:34.558
weird turtle-man?

08:36.197 --> 08:42.871
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,
your part-Jewish friend.

08:44.213 --> 08:47.948
You sent me here to give Ben
some presents.

08:48.121 --> 08:50.421
Remember?

08:51.662 --> 08:53.757
What?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.137
Ben, why don't you open
some more presents.

08:56.337 --> 08:59.070
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

08:59.545 --> 09:03.075
There's a sentence I never thought
I'd say.

09:04.053 --> 09:05.579
What are you doing?

09:05.790 --> 09:08.921
You called and said you had trouble
finding a Santa costume..

09:09.097 --> 09:11.694
so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

09:11.936 --> 09:14.429
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.109
- Why?
- Because..

09:16.311 --> 09:19.010
I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.675
And you're wrecking it.

09:20.887 --> 09:24.952
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowl full of jelly.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.905
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

09:32.343 --> 09:36.306
Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.

09:36.484 --> 09:40.823
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

09:42.564 --> 09:44.625
Santa? Really?

09:45.135 --> 09:50.442
- Yeah, is that okay?
- Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

09:51.447 --> 09:55.582
- No.
- Then it's okay!

09:57.761 --> 09:59.958
You know what, everybody?

10:00.165 --> 10:02.362
Go home.
You should be with your families.

10:02.571 --> 10:04.768
It's bad enough we're working
New Year's Eve.

10:07.279 --> 10:10.650
Did I not tell anyone
about New Year's Eve?

10:10.820 --> 10:14.190
All right, look, go. Go home, okay?
Merry Christmas.

10:15.262 --> 10:17.459
- Merry Christmas.
- Peace on earth.

10:17.634 --> 10:22.337
- Bye.
- Good. Godspeed, good people.

10:23.078 --> 10:27.246
- You're not gonna go?
- No. I couldn't leave you alone.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.720
Thanks.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.929
Besides, I can't leave until that
Christmas party downstairs clears out.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.368
There are some pissed-off
insurance people looking for that ham.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.616
- Chandler Bing.
- Hi, honey. We're all here.

10:43.786 --> 10:45.551
We want to wish you
a merry Christmas.

10:45.790 --> 10:47.953
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

10:50.700 --> 10:52.795
Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.

10:53.004 --> 10:55.567
So is it horrible?
Is everybody working really hard?

10:55.843 --> 10:58.644
Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.

10:58.883 --> 11:01.548
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.

11:02.423 --> 11:04.917
It is. Did I not tell you about her?

11:06.097 --> 11:08.898
About the time you told me
about New Year's Eve.

11:09.103 --> 11:12.200
- Where's everybody else?
- I sent them home.

11:12.376 --> 11:16.180
You are such a good boss.
Is she pretty?

11:18.889 --> 11:21.086
Answer faster. Answer faster.

11:21.327 --> 11:24.128
- I don't know.
- Answer better. Answer better.

11:25.235 --> 11:28.264
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a colleague.

11:28.475 --> 11:31.539
- What does she do there?
- She's regional vice president.

11:31.715 --> 11:34.208
- She's just below me.
- She did what?

11:38.261 --> 11:41.632
Below me.

11:43.004 --> 11:45.406
Wait, is Wendy the runner-up
Miss Oklahoma?

11:45.576 --> 11:47.238
What?!

11:48.582 --> 11:50.745
Well, she didn't win.

11:52.122 --> 11:53.921
All right, maybe I should let you..

11:54.126 --> 11:57.098
and the second prettiest girl
in Oklahoma get back to work.

11:57.299 --> 12:01.296
Second prettiest that year. Of all
the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..

12:01.508 --> 12:02.976
Chandler, stop talking.

12:05.048 --> 12:07.679
Honey, there's really
nothing to worry about.

12:07.921 --> 12:10.153
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

12:10.358 --> 12:11.622
Okay.

12:11.929 --> 12:14.628
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

12:14.801 --> 12:18.707
- Merry Christmas, you guys.
- Merry Christmas.

12:24.186 --> 12:27.682
- The wife says hi.
- Fun conversation?

12:27.894 --> 12:30.923
Well, she's just got
this weird idea that..

12:31.100 --> 12:34.402
because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.

12:34.574 --> 12:36.601
Really?

12:37.514 --> 12:40.178
Would that be so terrible?

12:42.122 --> 12:45.219
This is probably the wrong thing
to be worrying about..

12:45.395 --> 12:49.233
but you're getting ham
on my only tie.

12:51.140 --> 12:54.374
- Back off, missy!
- Missy?

12:54.581 --> 12:57.177
I don't know. I'm not used to girls
making passes at me.

12:57.386 --> 13:01.417
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?

13:02.396 --> 13:06.963
- You are to me.
- No. No. No!

13:07.974 --> 13:11.539
- Look, I'm married.
- So? I'm married.

13:11.782 --> 13:13.649
I'm happily married.

13:15.221 --> 13:16.450
What's that like?

13:17.560 --> 13:21.796
- Right. So I'm sorry, but..
- Seriously? Happily married?

13:21.969 --> 13:25.066
So that phone call before,
that was happy?

13:25.308 --> 13:28.509
Well, look, it's not easy
to spend this much time apart.

13:28.716 --> 13:30.913
She's entitled to be
a little paranoid.

13:31.087 --> 13:33.752
Or, in this case, right on the money.

13:34.894 --> 13:39.358
You know, she's amazing
and beautiful and smart.

13:39.537 --> 13:43.169
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.

13:45.750 --> 13:51.193
Look, you're a really nice person,
ham-stealing and adultery aside.

13:53.064 --> 13:55.865
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.

13:56.037 --> 13:59.066
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.

13:59.611 --> 14:01.877
Okay, let me ask you something.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.614
If what you and your wife have
is so great..

14:05.790 --> 14:09.058
then why are you spending
Christmas with me?

14:10.465 --> 14:13.062
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

14:14.273 --> 14:15.640
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

14:15.810 --> 14:18.805
You're the most beautiful woman
in most rooms.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.332
What's going on?
You and I just made out.

14:29.504 --> 14:31.940
- You and I are making out?
- Well, not anymore.

14:32.710 --> 14:36.514
- But we don't do that.
- I know. I just thought it would be fun.

14:37.687 --> 14:40.716
- How drunk are you?
- Drunk enough that I wanna do this.

14:40.893 --> 14:44.093
Not so drunk that you should
feel guilty about taking advantage.

14:45.903 --> 14:47.930
That's a perfect amount.

14:54.286 --> 14:56.051
- You know what's weird?
- What?

14:56.290 --> 14:58.659
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

14:58.829 --> 15:04.067
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

15:05.475 --> 15:09.108
You wanna get under the covers?
Okay.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.428
Wow, you are really fast.

15:19.637 --> 15:22.803
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

15:24.179 --> 15:27.276
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

15:27.452 --> 15:30.117
- You want to do it at the same time?
- Count of three?

15:30.291 --> 15:31.783
- One.
- Two.

15:31.962 --> 15:34.023
Three.

15:37.907 --> 15:41.972
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectively ruined.

15:42.182 --> 15:44.813
We weren't that close anyway.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.193
Are you really gonna go out
with that nurse-man?

15:50.566 --> 15:52.593
Well, you and I
are just goofing around.

15:52.803 --> 15:56.401
I thought, why not
just goof around with him?

15:58.515 --> 16:02.751
I don't know if you've ever looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

16:02.924 --> 16:05.224
Well, I have.

16:05.428 --> 16:10.393
And the technical definition
is two friends..

16:10.572 --> 16:16.881
who care a lot about each other
and have amazing sex..

16:19.356 --> 16:23.627
and just want to spend
more time together.

16:23.799 --> 16:26.965
If you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me..

16:27.138 --> 16:30.873
then we have to, you know,
get you my original dictionary.

16:33.652 --> 16:35.416
I am so bad at this.

16:36.323 --> 16:38.624
I think you're better
than you think you are.

16:38.829 --> 16:42.633
- Really? Okay. So if..?
- Know when to stop.

16:42.837 --> 16:44.898
I sensed that I should stop.

16:45.943 --> 16:48.140
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

16:51.621 --> 16:54.319
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

16:55.963 --> 16:58.490
I can't get married without
something old, something new..

16:58.668 --> 17:01.230
- something borrowed, something blue.
- Okay, okay.

17:01.473 --> 17:03.740
Here's something blue and new.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.472
You are so efficient. I love you.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.013
- Let's go.
- No, no, wait!

17:08.187 --> 17:09.884
We need something old.

17:10.091 --> 17:14.327
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.364
That'll work!

17:17.540 --> 17:19.372
I don't think so.

17:20.111 --> 17:22.047
Okay. Now we just need
something borrowed.

17:23.718 --> 17:27.522
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

17:27.726 --> 17:30.253
We'll bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.

17:41.788 --> 17:43.917
Okay, one thing at a time.

17:46.029 --> 17:48.056
Listen..

17:49.336 --> 17:50.805
I've been thinking.

17:52.242 --> 17:56.046
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
all of your money on our wedding.

17:56.216 --> 17:59.245
I mean, you work..
You work really hard for that.

17:59.524 --> 18:01.721
- Well..
- Well, you work for that.

18:03.632 --> 18:06.330
Look, I've thought about it too. And..

18:06.504 --> 18:11.104
I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

18:12.048 --> 18:16.045
- You do?
- Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.889
Yeah, look, when I proposed..

18:20.064 --> 18:24.164
I told you that I would do anything
to make you happy.

18:24.339 --> 18:28.006
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy, then..

18:28.180 --> 18:30.150
Then that's what we're gonna do.

18:30.752 --> 18:33.690
You are so sweet.

18:35.629 --> 18:40.002
But wait. What about our..?
What about the future and stuff?

18:40.204 --> 18:43.974
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.

18:44.145 --> 18:48.313
You know, we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.

18:49.523 --> 18:51.789
- You've thought about that?
- Yeah.

18:51.961 --> 18:55.992
- How many kids were we gonna have?
- Four. A boy, twin girls..

18:56.169 --> 18:58.640
and another boy.

18:59.376 --> 19:01.403
- What else did you think about?
- Well..

19:02.148 --> 19:06.020
stuff like where we'd live, you know.

19:06.223 --> 19:10.688
Like a small place outside the city
where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.

19:10.866 --> 19:14.533
And we could have a cat
that had a bell on its collar..

19:14.707 --> 19:18.579
and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

19:18.748 --> 19:23.052
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.531
You know what?

19:30.739 --> 19:33.677
I don't..
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

19:34.179 --> 19:36.308
- Sure you do.
- No.

19:37.619 --> 19:40.317
I want everything
that you've just said.

19:40.491 --> 19:42.962
I want a marriage.

19:43.464 --> 19:45.731
You sure?

19:47.573 --> 19:51.707
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

20:05.976 --> 20:10.110
- I love it!
- Really? You're not gonna return it?

20:10.317 --> 20:11.786
Well, not this second.

20:14.627 --> 20:17.029
Hey, look, you guys. It's snowing!

20:20.204 --> 20:25.705
- Wow, it's so beautiful.
- Wow, it really is.

20:28.020 --> 20:31.083
Wendy's a fat-girl name.

20:31.293 --> 20:33.764
Aren't we done with that?

20:33.932 --> 20:38.032
Okay, fine. Fine.
Let's talk about snow.

20:39.108 --> 20:43.846
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where
my husband's having sex on a copier?

20:46.323 --> 20:48.851
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.396
Look at that.
That's a Christmas miracle!

20:56.476 --> 21:00.473
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to be with you.

21:00.652 --> 21:02.416
I missed you so much.

21:02.589 --> 21:05.891
- Hey, hey. Who'd you miss the most?
- Monica.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.958
Gotcha.

21:11.507 --> 21:15.971
- I never want to leave you again.
- I thought if you left, you'd get fired.

21:16.182 --> 21:19.644
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.

21:20.024 --> 21:23.589
- What?
- What? You..? You really quit your job?

21:23.798 --> 21:27.259
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I could not stand leaving you.

21:27.539 --> 21:31.273
Why should I be the only one who
doesn't do what he really wants to do?

21:31.479 --> 21:36.421
- Well, what do you really wanna do?
- I have not thought this through.

21:37.058 --> 21:40.554
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I should've talked to you first.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.965
No, I think that this is what
you wanna do. I think it's great!

21:44.873 --> 21:46.740
Thanks.

21:46.978 --> 21:52.046
Chandler, your being here is the best
Christmas present I could ever imagine.

21:53.591 --> 21:56.084
- Now give me my real gift.
- Yeah.

21:56.262 --> 21:58.323
- Thank you.
- Here, pass those around.

22:06.717 --> 22:11.021
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

22:12.763 --> 22:15.097
How did you know?

22:15.267 --> 22:19.264
What? Are you kidding?
I can't return this.

22:20.444 --> 22:22.642
It's time we started thinking about
other people.

22:22.816 --> 22:25.446
And besides, this gift still says,
"I love you guys."

22:25.655 --> 22:29.458
- Mine says, "To Lillian Myers."
- I don't have a job.

22:34.338 --> 22:36.935
Actuary? No.

22:37.278 --> 22:40.444
Bookkeeper? No.

22:40.618 --> 22:43.214
Topless dancer?

22:48.634 --> 22:52.164
Hey, you know what I just realized?
You are the sole wage earner.

22:52.341 --> 22:57.842
You are the head of the household.
I don't do anything. I'm a kept man!

22:58.053 --> 22:59.545
You are.

22:59.757 --> 23:01.157
Honey, here's 20 bucks.

23:01.459 --> 23:04.056
Go buy yourself something pretty
while I'm at work tomorrow.
