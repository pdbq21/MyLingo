WEBVTT

00:06.799 --> 00:09.677
These were expensive
and he'll grow out of them...

00:09.928 --> 00:14.224
...in 20 minutes,
but I couldn't resist!

00:16.476 --> 00:18.603
Look at these.

00:18.853 --> 00:19.812
Hey, Ben.

00:20.063 --> 00:23.233
"Just do it"!

00:23.900 --> 00:25.109
Oh, my God!

00:25.360 --> 00:28.947
Was that too much
pressure for him?

00:29.113 --> 00:33.201
- Is he hungry already?
- I guess so.

00:33.451 --> 00:36.621
You know, it's...

00:38.081 --> 00:42.126
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

00:42.377 --> 00:45.630
I gotta get one too.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.633
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:48.883 --> 00:51.761
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.388
Ladle?

00:53.638 --> 00:54.806
Will you guys grow up?

00:55.056 --> 00:57.809
This is the most beautiful
thing in the world.

00:58.059 --> 01:02.605
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

01:03.231 --> 01:08.570
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

01:08.820 --> 01:12.240
If you're uncomfortable,
just ask questions.

01:12.490 --> 01:15.660
Carol's fine with it.

01:17.162 --> 01:19.539
Carol?

01:20.915 --> 01:26.129
I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

01:27.088 --> 01:29.549
Sure.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.011
Does it hurt?

01:33.261 --> 01:35.930
It did at first, but not anymore.

01:36.181 --> 01:38.725
Chandler?

01:40.101 --> 01:42.479
So, how often can you do it?

01:42.729 --> 01:44.689
As much as he needs.

01:44.939 --> 01:48.943
Okay, I got one, I got one.

01:49.778 --> 01:53.448
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

01:53.698 --> 01:56.826
The One With the Breast Milk

02:41.906 --> 02:44.826
- Any muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.

02:45.076 --> 02:46.953
You're busy, I'll get it.

02:47.203 --> 02:49.831
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.

02:50.081 --> 02:53.335
You're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

02:53.585 --> 02:57.005
- There you go.
- Thank you.

02:57.255 --> 03:00.592
What a bitch!

03:02.427 --> 03:05.513
I have a friend at
Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

03:05.764 --> 03:07.974
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

03:08.224 --> 03:10.518
Anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

03:10.769 --> 03:14.898
I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

03:18.109 --> 03:21.363
- I'll go with you.
- Great.

03:22.822 --> 03:25.367
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.

03:25.617 --> 03:29.371
And hello to the rest.

03:30.580 --> 03:34.876
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

03:35.126 --> 03:36.378
Will it be a problem?

03:36.628 --> 03:38.672
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

03:38.922 --> 03:43.677
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

03:43.927 --> 03:47.097
Monica, she will kill you.

03:47.222 --> 03:51.434
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

03:54.479 --> 03:58.483
So Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

03:58.733 --> 04:01.319
It's actually not that big a deal.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.655
It's a big deal to me.
This is great.

04:03.905 --> 04:05.907
I really appreciate this.

04:06.157 --> 04:09.160
You're welcome.

04:22.465 --> 04:24.885
Bijan for men?

04:25.135 --> 04:27.971
Bijan for men?

04:30.140 --> 04:31.808
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.

04:32.058 --> 04:34.185
Did you hear about the new guy?

04:34.436 --> 04:40.358
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man."

04:48.325 --> 04:51.244
Hombre?

04:54.539 --> 04:56.833
What's he doing in my section?

04:57.083 --> 04:58.793
I guess he doesn't know.

04:59.044 --> 05:01.463
Well, he's gonna.

05:01.713 --> 05:05.300
I'll see you a little later, okay?

05:06.968 --> 05:08.887
Hey, how you doing?

05:09.137 --> 05:10.639
Mornin'.

05:10.889 --> 05:13.808
Listen, I know you're new...

05:14.059 --> 05:16.311
...but it's understood
that everything...

05:16.561 --> 05:21.525
...from young men's to
the escalator is my territory.

05:21.691 --> 05:24.861
"Your territory"?

05:25.111 --> 05:26.738
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.

05:26.988 --> 05:28.406
Hombre?

05:28.657 --> 05:32.410
Yeah, all right.

05:37.624 --> 05:40.252
You were saying?

05:42.712 --> 05:47.342
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

05:47.592 --> 05:49.219
We shopped and we had lunch.

05:49.469 --> 05:51.137
What did I have?

05:51.388 --> 05:55.600
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.

05:55.851 --> 05:56.977
Hi. What's up?

05:57.227 --> 06:01.690
I went shopping with Monica
and I had a salad.

06:02.440 --> 06:06.194
Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?

06:06.194 --> 06:08.864
We went shopping for...

06:09.114 --> 06:10.323
For...

06:10.574 --> 06:13.910
For fur.

06:14.953 --> 06:18.373
You went shopping for fur?

06:18.623 --> 06:22.377
And then I realized
that I'm against that.

06:22.627 --> 06:26.047
So then we bought some...

06:26.298 --> 06:28.925
Boobs.

06:33.263 --> 06:35.724
You bought boobs?

06:37.434 --> 06:39.644
Bras!

06:39.895 --> 06:41.730
We bought bras!

06:41.980 --> 06:45.734
We bought bras.

06:47.277 --> 06:48.862
Bijan for men?

06:49.112 --> 06:50.780
Bijan for men?

06:51.031 --> 06:53.950
Bijan for...

06:54.284 --> 06:55.577
Hey, Annabel.

06:55.827 --> 07:00.123
I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

07:00.373 --> 07:03.877
Actually, I sort of have plans.

07:07.672 --> 07:10.342
You ready, Annabel?

07:10.592 --> 07:13.595
You bet.

07:13.887 --> 07:16.598
Maybe some other time.

07:25.774 --> 07:29.861
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

07:30.112 --> 07:31.822
Bijan for men?

07:32.072 --> 07:35.242
Bijan for men!

07:35.242 --> 07:37.077
And this is Funny Clown.

07:37.327 --> 07:40.789
It's only for after his naps,
not before, or he won't sleep.

07:41.039 --> 07:44.459
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

07:44.709 --> 07:49.506
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.884
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

07:53.135 --> 07:58.557
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

07:59.099 --> 08:00.809
This is so cute!

08:01.059 --> 08:02.686
I got that for him!

08:02.936 --> 08:06.022
"My Mommies Love Me."

08:08.400 --> 08:11.486
That's clever.

08:12.654 --> 08:15.407
Oh, hi, Jul...

08:15.657 --> 08:18.660
Hi, Jew!

08:22.080 --> 08:23.457
Okay, sure.

08:23.707 --> 08:26.585
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.

08:26.835 --> 08:30.505
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

08:33.967 --> 08:35.469
Yes, I did.

08:35.719 --> 08:39.389
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

08:42.469 --> 08:44.903
He's going through this
whole religious thing.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.596
Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.395
Ben, dinner!

08:57.645 --> 08:59.063
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

08:59.313 --> 09:02.775
Did you microwave that?
You can't do that to breast milk.

09:03.025 --> 09:07.405
I think I know
how to heat breast milk.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.742
What did you just do?

09:11.993 --> 09:13.703
I licked my arm, what?

09:13.953 --> 09:16.163
It's breast milk!

09:16.414 --> 09:17.665
So?

09:17.915 --> 09:22.628
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

09:22.837 --> 09:26.424
What is the big deal?

09:26.966 --> 09:30.303
What did you just do?

09:30.886 --> 09:35.766
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

09:35.808 --> 09:38.686
You won't even taste it?

09:38.936 --> 09:41.272
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

09:41.522 --> 09:47.111
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.038
- Where is everybody?
- At the park. Where have you been?

09:57.288 --> 09:58.247
Just out.

09:58.497 --> 10:03.836
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

10:04.086 --> 10:06.380
- Thanks for your jacket.
- No problem.

10:06.631 --> 10:09.884
You can borrow it, by the way.

10:10.134 --> 10:13.554
Here are your keys, honey.

10:15.973 --> 10:21.354
If you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

10:23.189 --> 10:25.399
You know what probably happened?

10:25.650 --> 10:28.903
Someone stole my credit card.

10:29.403 --> 10:33.157
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

10:33.366 --> 10:36.369
That is an excellent,
excellent question.

10:36.619 --> 10:39.121
That is excellent.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.250
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

10:42.500 --> 10:43.751
- Judy.
- Who?

10:44.001 --> 10:45.002
- Julie.
- What?

10:45.253 --> 10:48.172
Jody.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.758
You were with Julie?

10:51.008 --> 10:54.595
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...

10:54.846 --> 10:57.598
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

10:57.849 --> 11:01.477
And then one thing
led to another...

11:01.727 --> 11:04.397
...and before I knew it, we were...

11:04.647 --> 11:07.733
...shopping.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.531
Oh, my God!

11:14.240 --> 11:17.577
Wait, we only did it once.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.372
It meant nothing to me!

11:23.332 --> 11:27.795
Really, I was thinking
of you the whole time.

11:29.255 --> 11:33.384
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

11:33.634 --> 11:37.555
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

11:37.805 --> 11:39.015
That is not true!

11:39.265 --> 11:42.518
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

11:42.768 --> 11:47.982
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

11:48.399 --> 11:52.236
Okay, I just have to know one thing.

11:54.489 --> 11:58.075
Did you go to Bloomingdale's?

12:10.546 --> 12:16.135
Okay, I just really need
to not be with you right now.

12:24.727 --> 12:25.937
Hi, who's this?

12:26.187 --> 12:30.066
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.819
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

12:33.069 --> 12:36.906
Joanne, it's not
as simple as all that.

12:37.156 --> 12:42.620
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

12:47.557 --> 12:48.725
How did we do?

12:48.975 --> 12:52.145
I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

12:52.395 --> 12:53.605
I did not freak out.

12:53.855 --> 12:57.901
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.

12:58.151 --> 12:59.778
It's gross!

13:00.028 --> 13:03.031
My breast milk is gross?

13:03.365 --> 13:06.868
This should be fun.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.079
There's nothing wrong with it.

13:09.329 --> 13:12.999
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

13:13.250 --> 13:18.046
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.675
Don't be silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

13:21.925 --> 13:24.386
Just taste it.

13:24.636 --> 13:27.097
That would be no.

13:27.347 --> 13:28.306
- Come on.
- Try it.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.474
It's natural.

13:29.724 --> 13:31.059
It doesn't taste bad.

13:31.309 --> 13:34.145
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like...

13:34.396 --> 13:35.188
Like what?

13:35.438 --> 13:36.439
Cantaloupe juice.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.609
Exactly.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.242
You've tasted it.

13:47.492 --> 13:50.495
You've tasted it.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.624
Oh, you've tasted it.

13:55.250 --> 13:59.713
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

14:06.094 --> 14:09.014
Give me the bottle.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.313
Get me the towel.

14:39.836 --> 14:42.380
Howdy.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.801
Give me a box of juice.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.096
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

14:50.347 --> 14:54.392
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

14:54.643 --> 14:58.605
Or this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

14:58.855 --> 15:03.318
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.154
What do you care?

15:06.404 --> 15:09.616
You're an actor.
This is your day job. It's nothing!

15:09.866 --> 15:12.327
I know, but I was the best.

15:12.577 --> 15:17.207
You know? I liked being the best.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.546
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

15:22.796 --> 15:26.049
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

15:26.299 --> 15:27.384
Say you do that.

15:27.634 --> 15:33.306
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.350
Then where you gonna run?

15:35.600 --> 15:36.476
You're right.

15:36.726 --> 15:40.147
I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

15:40.397 --> 15:45.485
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

15:45.735 --> 15:48.572
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!

15:48.822 --> 15:54.119
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.413
I don't know what to say.

15:56.663 --> 15:59.458
That's good because I'm not listening.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.460
I feel terrible. I really do.

16:01.710 --> 16:05.464
I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

16:07.215 --> 16:11.845
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terrible?

16:12.095 --> 16:14.639
- It's that terrible?
- You don't get it!

16:14.890 --> 16:16.600
It's bad enough
she stole the guy...

16:16.850 --> 16:19.561
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.980
But now...

16:22.230 --> 16:24.357
...she's actually...

16:24.608 --> 16:28.820
But now she's actually stealing you!

16:30.989 --> 16:32.908
What are you talking about?

16:33.158 --> 16:35.494
Nobody could steal me from you.

16:35.744 --> 16:41.333
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.503
You're my...

16:44.711 --> 16:47.631
And we're...

16:49.216 --> 16:53.595
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!

16:56.515 --> 17:01.478
You guys, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

17:01.728 --> 17:04.815
But I love you guys too!

17:09.236 --> 17:12.989
I really needed that.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.242
I know that right now...

17:15.492 --> 17:18.036
...you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

17:18.286 --> 17:21.498
But she didn't do anything wrong.

17:21.748 --> 17:26.169
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

17:26.420 --> 17:30.882
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.219
Will you give it a chance?

17:34.469 --> 17:37.222
For me?

17:38.014 --> 17:40.434
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

17:40.684 --> 17:43.895
I'd do anything for you!

17:44.146 --> 17:47.399
Wait, wait, wait!

18:04.458 --> 18:06.835
Mornin'.

18:07.836 --> 18:11.840
I said, mornin'!

18:12.090 --> 18:14.801
I heard you.

18:14.843 --> 18:18.013
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.016
You boys ready?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.355
Ready.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.524
Yeah, I'm ready.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.155
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

19:17.406 --> 19:19.366
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

19:19.616 --> 19:23.453
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.330
Sorry. I'm such a doofus!

19:25.580 --> 19:28.792
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.503
My God, what happened?

19:31.753 --> 19:34.131
These new kids, they never last.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.175
Sooner or later they all...

19:37.426 --> 19:40.178
...stop lasting.

19:40.429 --> 19:44.099
What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

19:44.349 --> 19:46.893
Sure.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.872
I just thought we should hang out.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.000
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.295
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.547
I know.

20:15.797 --> 20:19.051
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

20:19.301 --> 20:23.221
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.556
Really?

20:24.806 --> 20:25.807
Me?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.935
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.895
Ross is so crazy about you...

20:30.145 --> 20:33.315
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...

20:33.565 --> 20:36.360
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

20:36.610 --> 20:41.657
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.834
Well, you're not totally paranoid.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.349
When you and Ross
first started going out...

21:07.599 --> 21:11.353
...it was really hard for me...

21:11.895 --> 21:17.651
...for many reasons of which
I'm not gonna bore you with now.

21:20.946 --> 21:26.410
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.664
And Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

21:30.914 --> 21:34.668
...and God, I hate it when she's right!

21:35.252 --> 21:37.045
Thanks.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.008
Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

21:41.258 --> 21:44.011
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love it.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.763
I'd love it too.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.307
Shoot, I gotta go.

21:48.557 --> 21:53.020
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.

22:00.319 --> 22:04.281
What a manipulative bitch.

22:34.045 --> 22:36.422
It's not bad.
