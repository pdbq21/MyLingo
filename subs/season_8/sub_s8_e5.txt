00:01.101 --> 00:04.036
This one's rare.
This one's medium-well. Go!

00:04.204 --> 00:06.138
Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!

00:06.306 --> 00:09.935
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!

00:10.944 --> 00:14.311
-Well, hello there.
-Hi.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.176
I didn't see this on the menu.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.377
Tim, this is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.988
-So you're Monica's boss?
-No, she's my boss.

00:23.156 --> 00:26.887
-"Sous" is French for "under."
-I "sous-stand."

00:27.995 --> 00:32.193
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.960
-You made pesto?
-Yes, I did.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.263
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o?

00:38.438 --> 00:41.896
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.435
I still need the calamari and salad.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.305
I like your necklace.

00:48.482 --> 00:52.248
"Coming up, Monica. I have to obey you,
otherwise the system breaks down."

00:52.419 --> 00:55.752
"l know that." "Then why are
we having this conversation? "

00:55.923 --> 00:58.414
-I made it myself.
-You are so talented.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.822
Well, it's no pesto.

01:01.662 --> 01:05.257
Let's just cut to the chase.
You're single. You're single.

01:05.432 --> 01:08.333
He gets off work at 11.
She'll be waiting for your call.

01:08.502 --> 01:13.530
I'll give him your number if I could just
get one calamari and one caesar salad!

01:15.442 --> 01:19.276
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

02:00.020 --> 02:04.354
-Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
-You know me, sir.

02:05.092 --> 02:08.619
Do you know how I can get around
the office computer network..

02:08.795 --> 02:11.855
so I can access
the really good Internet porn?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.260
You're a joker, Bing.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.761
What's funny about that?

02:19.740 --> 02:24.302
-Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
-That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

02:24.544 --> 02:26.512
I think you know where I wanna go.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.240
-The Hard Rock Cafe?
-Yeah.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.083
-Again?
-Yeah.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.613
-I'm telling you, I like the food.
-You like the Purple Rain display.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.592
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

02:43.263 --> 02:48.496
-Did that guy just call you Toby?
-Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

02:49.269 --> 02:53.569
-Why don't you correct him?
-It's been going on way too long now.

02:53.874 --> 02:57.332
The first time, we were just passing
each other, so I didn't say anything.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.878
The next time he said,
"Toby, want a doughnut?"

03:01.048 --> 03:03.778
I wanted the doughnut.

03:04.451 --> 03:08.410
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

03:08.655 --> 03:12.785
-Chandler, you have to tell him.
-That would be so awkward.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.291
We don't work together.
He's on the sixth floor.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.431
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.362
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

03:22.602 --> 03:27.301
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

03:30.744 --> 03:33.178
Oh, my God.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.372
Chandler "M." Bing.

03:38.685 --> 03:43.418
It's not just an "M."
Your middle name is Muriel!

03:43.623 --> 03:46.319
It is a family name.

03:46.526 --> 03:50.326
Chandler Muriel Bing.

03:50.597 --> 03:55.091
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

03:56.203 --> 03:59.366
Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your memory loss.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.597
What is it?

04:00.807 --> 04:03.776
Your brain transplant
wasn't successful.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.843
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.208
Is it serious?

04:09.483 --> 04:11.917
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body..

04:12.085 --> 04:18.046
and synthesize antibodies
to stop you from rejecting the brain.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.920
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.963
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body..

04:26.166 --> 04:28.464
it was gone.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.131
Very nice, people.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.501
I'll change and we can go.

04:36.710 --> 04:41.238
-What happened to Jessica's body?
-You'll have to see it on TV.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.507
-You don't know, do you?
-Couldn't care less.

04:45.085 --> 04:48.680
-Good scene, man.
-You too.

04:51.358 --> 04:54.088
What? You weren't in it.

04:55.729 --> 04:59.256
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash.

04:59.499 --> 05:03.367
-Hi.
-Why haven't I seen you here before?

05:03.570 --> 05:09.531
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.040
Which I'm not.
I'm not.

05:12.479 --> 05:17.576
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

05:18.518 --> 05:22.249
And your dog's name is Wally.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.787
-Look, I'm just stroking your arm.
-Here we go.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.028
Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.428
-Monica.
-Hi.

05:35.702 --> 05:40.639
I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.535
I can't wait
to get "sous-neath" him.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.503
-I have to fire him.
-Why?

05:47.747 --> 05:51.080
He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.014
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.514
He was nervous.
You can be intimidating.

05:57.724 --> 06:01.558
And your pastry chef can stand
to be taken down a peg.

06:01.761 --> 06:05.458
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.963
But, Monica, he loves his job so much.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.935
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

06:14.407 --> 06:17.501
All right. But if he lights
someone else on fire, he's gone.

06:17.677 --> 06:21.374
That's fair. Thank you so much.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.316
Looks like he got you
a little bit too.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.580
I paid to have this done.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.949
Love it!

06:35.962 --> 06:40.058
Hey. You know,
Kash really liked you.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.359
He thought you were charming.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.629
-I thought I was an idiot.
-I'm with you.

06:47.707 --> 06:53.168
-He asked if you'd go out with him.
-I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.507
-What did you say?
-"No."

06:55.782 --> 06:57.579
What?

06:57.784 --> 07:02.983
I figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

07:04.090 --> 07:08.618
First of all, Kash Ford?
Not people.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.388
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

07:11.631 --> 07:17.399
No. I didn't know if you told people.
This was when Kash was still "people."

07:17.637 --> 07:21.403
-Good. Just have him call me.
-I don't think that's..

07:21.641 --> 07:26.340
Go do it or I'll come back
to that set. I'll meet more actors.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.746
-Hey, Bob.
-How's my pal Toby doing today?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.886
If I see him, I'll ask.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.487
Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

07:41.728 --> 07:43.423
-Yeah.
-You know him?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.131
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

07:46.666 --> 07:51.160
-What about adding him to our team?
-Bob?

07:51.404 --> 07:57.343
Working here with us? Every day?
I don't know if he has what it takes.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.377
-They love him down on six.
-But this is 11.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.742
It's almost twice as hard up here.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.887
-Okay, Bob will stay put.
-I think it's best, sir.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.818
We do need to find somebody.
Work is starting to pile up.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.190
I've got a stack
of documents this high.

08:16.396 --> 08:20.799
Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.960
That's a good one, Bing.

08:24.471 --> 08:29.067
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

08:33.913 --> 08:37.679
I gave him another chance,
but Tim has got to go.

08:37.884 --> 08:41.411
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.954
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

08:45.225 --> 08:47.955
-But don't fire him today.
-Why?

08:48.194 --> 08:52.096
-Because I'm dumping him today.
-You said he was sweet.

08:52.298 --> 08:56.132
He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.930
"Did you get home okay?
Was your shower okay?"

09:00.206 --> 09:02.868
-Don't pick up the phone.
-Then he comes over!

09:03.043 --> 09:06.444
"I was so worried about you."
Be a man!

09:07.113 --> 09:09.013
So I can't fire him?

09:09.249 --> 09:12.480
And dump him the same day?
He'll kill himself.

09:12.685 --> 09:15.153
I'll fire him, and you go out
with him another week.

09:15.321 --> 09:19.223
Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.725
We'll both do it today
and he'll just have to deal with it.

09:23.430 --> 09:29.164
Okay. But who's gonna go first?
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.530
-What?
-Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

09:32.806 --> 09:36.367
Bitch!
And dump a guy that's just been fired?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.508
Blond bitch!

09:38.745 --> 09:43.182
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.782
All right, that makes sense.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.021
But screw you! I'm going first!

09:54.627 --> 09:56.754
-Toby, you got a sec?
-Sure. What's up?

09:56.996 --> 10:01.899
I wanted to get transferred up here,
but it's not gonna happen.

10:02.168 --> 10:06.502
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "11th-floor material."

10:07.006 --> 10:10.874
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

10:12.879 --> 10:16.838
What's the best excuse for why
I'm not drinking on this date tonight?

10:17.083 --> 10:20.052
"I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"..

10:20.320 --> 10:24.654
or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?

10:24.858 --> 10:26.758
You're not gonna
tell him you're pregnant?

10:26.926 --> 10:30.521
I don't think so. Books say wait
till the third date to tell the guy..

10:30.697 --> 10:32.756
you got something
growing in your uterus.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.591
-Hey.
-Hi.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.362
What do you want to do tonight?

10:38.605 --> 10:42.666
There's a powerful Ukrainian film
playing. Interested?

10:42.876 --> 10:47.279
No. But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

10:47.514 --> 10:51.610
-Rach, you wanna come?
-I can't. I've got a date.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.481
-A date?
-Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

10:55.688 --> 11:00.489
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's regular.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.856
It's mundane.
It's actually a little dull.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.999
It's no Ukrainian film.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.362
Earrings!

11:11.070 --> 11:16.838
-She's got a date? With who?
-I set her up with this actor.

11:17.043 --> 11:21.776
-You set her up?
-No.

11:21.981 --> 11:25.212
-What were you thinking?
-That it was okay..

11:25.385 --> 11:28.354
because you two haven't dated
in five years.

11:28.588 --> 11:33.924
I'm worried about my baby.
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

11:34.194 --> 11:40.394
-Where is this "actor" taking them?
-Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

11:41.401 --> 11:45.303
They're taking the ferry
to a place on Staten lsland.

11:45.505 --> 11:51.671
My baby's going on a ferry? Do you
have any idea how dangerous those are?

11:51.878 --> 11:56.008
Aren't we talking about
those big boats that go really slow?

11:56.216 --> 12:02.121
Why not just jump out of an airplane
or burn each other with matches?

12:06.092 --> 12:09.823
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.396
Hey, I hear you're going
on a ferry tonight.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.965
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

12:17.437 --> 12:21.100
Do you guys think this is too slutty?
Hi, Kash.

12:21.341 --> 12:26.074
-Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
-Yeah. See you guys later.

12:26.346 --> 12:31.079
Have a great time, you guys.
And yes, it is too slutty!

12:36.723 --> 12:38.315
Hi.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.253
Hi.

12:40.426 --> 12:44.556
I'm glad you called.
I feel like I'm always calling you.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.800
What's up?
Is everything okay with Phoebe?

12:49.102 --> 12:52.503
It will be in a minute.

12:52.739 --> 12:57.438
-Tim, you're a really great guy.
-That's because I'm with you.

13:01.014 --> 13:05.110
It's just, I'm in a place in my life
right now where..

13:06.085 --> 13:09.350
So sorry. "This just in."

13:10.556 --> 13:13.184
It's the restaurant.
Monica needs me right away.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.056
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.190
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

13:20.867 --> 13:25.201
And I will be holding you right here.

13:33.112 --> 13:37.071
What movie do you wanna see?
And not one I have to read.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.376
I get that from books.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.889
-Books?
-Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes..

13:44.090 --> 13:45.489
but it's enough!

13:46.459 --> 13:50.919
Let's not see a movie.
We'll just stay here and hang.

13:51.130 --> 13:57.501
-Just wait for Rachel to come back?
-Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.262
Dude, what is going on?

14:00.506 --> 14:03.805
-I have to find out how it went.
-Why?

14:04.077 --> 14:09.310
-He could be my baby's stepfather.
-One date and they're getting married?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.914
He's not you!

14:13.453 --> 14:15.921
I can't believe she's dating!

14:16.155 --> 14:20.489
-What did you think she was gonna do?
-I don't know.

14:20.760 --> 14:25.424
-I can't believe this is happening.
-What do you mean?

14:25.631 --> 14:30.034
I thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.

14:30.636 --> 14:36.336
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's..

14:36.609 --> 14:39.442
it breaks my heart a little.

14:40.113 --> 14:44.447
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed..

14:44.650 --> 14:50.520
my kid comes running in, leaps up
on the bed and we all read the paper.

14:50.790 --> 14:54.021
Maybe fight over the science section.

14:54.694 --> 15:00.929
-That's nice. You can still have that.
-No. Rachel's out with some guy.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.069
My baby went with her.

15:04.504 --> 15:09.237
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.367
Hey, can I ask you something?

15:12.645 --> 15:18.880
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

15:19.552 --> 15:22.180
It used to be.

15:23.189 --> 15:26.750
Now she doesn't really have a face.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.260
Smokin' body, though.

15:31.864 --> 15:36.961
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

15:37.170 --> 15:41.231
No. But how much easier would it be
if it were?

15:41.507 --> 15:43.566
That's not what she wants.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.837
I know. And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.380
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.485
It won't be what you thought.
But no matter what..

15:55.721 --> 16:00.385
there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.084
Who cares what the picture looks like?

16:04.263 --> 16:06.163
Yeah.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.400
Let's you and me go out
and have some fun.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.264
Whatever you want. Come on.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.509
-We can catch that Ukrainian film.
-No, I said fun.

16:20.446 --> 16:22.243
-Hey, Toby?
-Hey, Bobby.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.379
It's Bob, actually.

16:26.085 --> 16:30.784
You work up here. Where's
Chandler Bing's office?

16:31.057 --> 16:34.754
Yeah, it's right..

16:36.162 --> 16:38.756
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

16:38.965 --> 16:41.433
I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.660
Okay, Bob. Listen.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.035
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.242
-Toby, don't.
-Bob.

16:50.476 --> 16:55.038
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover
for him.

16:55.281 --> 16:59.615
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.185
That puts me
in a difficult position.

17:04.123 --> 17:07.251
You do anything to Chandler,
it's gonna bring you down to his level.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.254
I guess you're right.

17:12.431 --> 17:16.765
Don't give him the satisfaction.
You're better than Chandler. We all are.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.404
Especially me, Toby.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.643
-Is everything okay?
-That depends.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.906
-How are you and Phoebe?
-Great. Thanks for introducing us.

17:31.117 --> 17:36.214
My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.447
-Phoebe!
-Monica!

17:39.959 --> 17:42.757
-You're fired!
-I'm breaking up with you!

17:43.162 --> 17:44.959
I'm breaking up with you.

17:45.164 --> 17:48.395
-You're fired.
-Why?

17:48.601 --> 17:52.799
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

17:53.039 --> 17:57.408
I'm sorry too.
But I like things done a certain way.

17:57.643 --> 18:02.979
-The chemistry's just not right.
-The chemistry thing for us too.

18:04.450 --> 18:08.318
Wow. Okay.

18:09.655 --> 18:15.821
I realize I came on a little strong.
It's because I think you're amazing.

18:17.463 --> 18:22.298
I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity.

18:22.501 --> 18:26.062
You're the most talented chef
I've ever worked for.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.573
Anyway..

18:34.180 --> 18:37.115
-Tim, wait.
-Yeah?

18:38.351 --> 18:43.152
I spoke too quickly. There's
a learning curve with this job.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.018
Maybe we could try it again.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.819
Thank you so much.
I know I can be better.

18:51.664 --> 18:55.862
And, Tim, I just want to say
good luck here.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.237
-Hello.
-Hi.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.843
How was the date?

19:08.047 --> 19:13.610
I'm alone and I just bought $15 worth
of candy bars. What do you think?

19:13.819 --> 19:18.222
-What happened?
-I told him I was pregnant.

19:18.491 --> 19:23.224
-He didn't take it so well?
-Well, better than you.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.659
-But still not what you want.
-Oh?

19:26.899 --> 19:30.494
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said:

19:30.703 --> 19:33.729
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."

19:34.240 --> 19:36.936
-He sounds swell.
-Doesn't he?

19:37.877 --> 19:42.371
You want a little cheering up?
Sit down.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.943
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.

19:50.589 --> 19:55.288
Chandler M. Bing.
Oh, my God.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.192
-I'm sorry about your date.
-It's all right.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.871
I guess I'm just done
with the dating thing.

20:06.105 --> 20:10.565
Just one more thing in my life
that's completely different.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.712
-This is hard.
-Yeah, I know.

20:16.682 --> 20:22.746
On the other hand, in seven months
you're gonna have something..

20:22.988 --> 20:28.893
that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.990
Just wait.

20:33.232 --> 20:37.692
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.337
You have no idea.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.298
Thanks, sweetie.

20:48.147 --> 20:53.949
-You wanna grab some coffee?
-No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

20:54.220 --> 20:58.919
-I thought I cheered you up.
-You did. There are 20 in here.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.259
-Good night.
-Good night.

21:09.502 --> 21:13.370
Ross? Hey, it's Mona.
From the wedding.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.234
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.476
-How are you?
-I'm good, except you owe me a dance.

21:21.747 --> 21:27.549
That's right. Well, would you be
interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?

21:28.888 --> 21:31.652
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.782
Great. Well..

21:35.494 --> 21:41.558
-I think I need another cup of coffee.
-Sure, let me get it for you.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.575
Bob?

21:58.751 --> 22:00.218
Bob!

22:00.586 --> 22:02.213
Bob!

22:02.988 --> 22:07.584
-What the hell are you doing?
-This is Chandler's office.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.886
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
