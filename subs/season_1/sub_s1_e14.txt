WEBVTT

00:02.369 --> 00:04.394
Ross, she wants you.

00:04.604 --> 00:07.164
We just live in the same building.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.006
-Any contact? <br/>-She lent me an egg.

00:10.176 --> 00:13.976
-You're in! <br/>-Right.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.079
Hey, Ross.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.886
Come on. Get back in the game.

00:25.058 --> 00:29.791
The Rachel thing isn't happening, <br/>your ex-wife's a lesbian....

00:30.063 --> 00:32.258
I don't think we need a third.

00:32.465 --> 00:35.525
Could we get an egg, <br/>still in the shell?

00:35.835 --> 00:36.824
An egg?

00:37.003 --> 00:41.906
Go up to her and say, <br/>"I'm returning your egg."

00:42.442 --> 00:44.842
I think it's winning.

00:45.011 --> 00:48.174
-It's insane. <br/>-She'll love it.

00:48.615 --> 00:52.642
-Thank you. <br/>-Thank you. Here.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.546
Go with the egg, my friend.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.191
Go, go, go!

01:03.196 --> 01:06.461
-Think it'll work? <br/>-No way. It's suicide.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.258
The One With The Candy Hearts

01:56.616 --> 01:58.811
-You can't do this. <br/>-Do what?

01:58.985 --> 02:03.888
-Roger wants to take her out. <br/>-No! Remember why you dumped him?

02:04.457 --> 02:06.857
Because he was creepy.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.994
And mean. And frightening.

02:09.162 --> 02:13.599
Still, it's nice to have <br/>a date on Valentine's Day!

02:14.300 --> 02:16.860
You can go out with a creep any night.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.334
I know I do.

02:22.242 --> 02:27.475
-What are you doing tomorrow night? <br/>-That depends on how tonight goes.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.808
-About tonight <br/>-Don't you bail on me!

02:31.017 --> 02:34.612
I said I'd bring a friend <br/>for her friend.

02:34.787 --> 02:39.019
-But her friend sounds like a <br/>-Pathetic mess. I know, but....

02:39.659 --> 02:42.321
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.259
I'm thinking....

02:48.968 --> 02:50.765
Thanks.

02:50.937 --> 02:55.397
You haven't been out with a woman <br/>since Janice. You're doing this.

02:57.877 --> 03:02.405
-She said yes. <br/>-Way to go, man!

03:02.882 --> 03:05.180
Still got the egg, huh?

03:18.364 --> 03:20.423
How do I look?

03:20.833 --> 03:23.324
I don't care.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.332
There's Lorraine.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.909
No trading. You get the pretty one, <br/>I get the mess.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.278
Hi, Joey.

03:36.849 --> 03:40.080
Well, well! <br/>Look what you brought!

03:40.520 --> 03:42.750
Very nice.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.255
And what did you bring?

03:46.593 --> 03:48.424
She's checking her coat.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.995
I'm gonna wash the cab smell <br/>off of my hands.

03:52.198 --> 03:56.532
Get me a white zinfandel, <br/>and a glass of red for Janice.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.104
Janice?

04:03.843 --> 04:06.141
Janice!?

04:06.613 --> 04:07.739
Oh...

04:07.947 --> 04:09.346
... my...

04:09.549 --> 04:11.278
...God!

04:14.754 --> 04:17.621
Hey, it's Janice!

04:23.129 --> 04:25.654
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

04:25.832 --> 04:30.496
I've been waiting for, like, forever <br/>to go out with Lorraine.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.933
-Just calm down. <br/>-Calm down?

04:33.139 --> 04:37.576
You set me up with a woman I've <br/>dumped twice in the last five months!

04:38.511 --> 04:42.675
Can you stop yelling? <br/>You're making me nervous and....

04:45.251 --> 04:47.879
I can't go when I'm nervous.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.681
I'm sorry, you're right.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.119
Come on! Do it, do it!

04:59.065 --> 05:02.865
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing <br/>compared to Pete.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.060
-Who? <br/>-Pete the Weeper.

05:05.271 --> 05:09.105
The guy that used to cry <br/>every time we had sex?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.938
"Was it good for you?"

05:14.013 --> 05:18.279
I'd take crying any day <br/>over Howard, the "I win" guy!

05:18.484 --> 05:21.419
"I win! I win!"

05:21.921 --> 05:25.789
We went out for two months. <br/>I didn't win once.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.450
How do we end up with these jerks?

05:29.662 --> 05:32.495
We're some kind of magnets.

05:32.699 --> 05:36.635
I know I am. That's why I can't <br/>wear a digital watch.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.866
There's more beer, right?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.972
You know my friend who shaves her head?

05:47.513 --> 05:48.502
No.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.878
I have this friend <br/>who shaves her head.

05:52.085 --> 05:55.020
She says to break the <br/>bad boyfriend cycle...

05:55.221 --> 05:58.349
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

06:00.126 --> 06:04.654
Pheebs, this woman <br/>is voluntarily bald.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.788
Yeah.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.793
We can do it tomorrow night.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.264
It's Valentine's Day. <br/>It's perfect.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.702
Okay, what kind of ritual?

06:14.874 --> 06:19.368
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.313
Or...?

06:21.581 --> 06:27.577
Or we can chant and dance <br/>around naked with sticks.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.624
Burning's good.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.759
You know...

06:42.935 --> 06:47.429
... I can pick up quarters with my toes.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.371
Yeah? <br/>Good for you.

06:53.212 --> 06:56.340
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

07:01.854 --> 07:05.813
By the way, I cut you out of <br/>all of my pictures.

07:06.025 --> 07:10.894
So if you want, I have a bag <br/>with just your heads.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.826
That's okay.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.895
You could make little puppets <br/>out of them.

07:17.103 --> 07:21.665
And you could use them in your <br/>Theater of Cruelty!

07:23.376 --> 07:28.143
-We can't do that! <br/>-What? What can't you do?

07:31.417 --> 07:34.978
Can I talk to you for a second? <br/>Over there?

07:41.093 --> 07:43.755
We might be leaving now.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.955
Tell me it's you and me "we."

07:47.166 --> 07:51.193
She wants to slather my body <br/>with stuff and lick it off.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.430
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

07:54.640 --> 07:58.076
But I definitely want <br/>to be a part of it!

07:58.644 --> 08:02.375
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.080
You're right. I'm sorry.

08:05.251 --> 08:09.984
Can we have three <br/>chocolate mousses to go?

08:10.356 --> 08:12.950
I'm out of here.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.254
Here's my credit card. <br/>Dinner's on me.

08:17.463 --> 08:20.261
I hope she throws up on you.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.035
Thanks.

08:25.538 --> 08:28.302
-So.... <br/>-Just us.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.972
What a crappy night!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.835
I have enjoyed the fact...

08:34.046 --> 08:38.483
...that your shirt's been <br/>sticking out of your zipper.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.247
Excuse me.

08:48.294 --> 08:51.422
How you doing?

08:54.934 --> 08:58.495
So do we have the best friends, <br/>or what?

08:58.671 --> 09:02.835
Joey's not a friend. <br/>He's...

09:03.042 --> 09:07.502
...a stupid man who left us <br/>his credit card.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.514
Another drink? Dessert? <br/>A big-screen TV?

09:11.684 --> 09:14.778
-I'll have a drink. <br/>-Got it. Good woman!

09:20.793 --> 09:24.024
-A bottle of overpriced champagne. <br/>-Each.

09:24.196 --> 09:28.030
That's right, each. <br/>And a rob roy.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.134
I've always wanted to know.

09:48.120 --> 09:53.683
Happy Valentine's Day!

09:59.765 --> 10:03.701
Oh, I miss you already.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.929
-Can you believe this happened? <br/>-No, no!

10:08.641 --> 10:11.007
And yet it did.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.270
-Goodbye, Janice. <br/>-kiss me!

10:16.248 --> 10:18.478
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

10:18.651 --> 10:22.018
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

10:23.255 --> 10:25.519
-Hey, Janice. <br/>-Hi, Monica.

10:25.725 --> 10:29.752
Well, this was very special.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.022
Rach, come see who's out here!

10:33.199 --> 10:36.191
What's going on? Oh, my God!

10:36.402 --> 10:38.802
Janice! Hi!

10:38.971 --> 10:42.873
Janice is gonna go away now!

10:43.643 --> 10:46.635
I'll be right back.

10:46.846 --> 10:50.009
Joey! Look who it is!

10:53.052 --> 10:54.644
Good. Joey's home.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.254
This is so much fun!

10:57.423 --> 11:01.291
This is like a reunion in the hall!

11:02.628 --> 11:06.724
Ross, there's someone <br/>I want you to say hi to.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.500
He happened to call.

11:09.669 --> 11:14.504
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me! <br/>How did you know?

11:29.755 --> 11:33.486
So, if dogs experience jet lag...

11:33.726 --> 11:38.026
... because of the seven dog years <br/>to one human year thing...

11:38.264 --> 11:41.563
...when a dog flies <br/>from New York to Los Angeles...

11:41.834 --> 11:46.737
... he doesn't just lose three hours, <br/>he loses a week and a half.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.333
That's funny!

11:59.618 --> 12:02.451
They should be cooking the food soon.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.145
Oh, good.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.531
Who are they?

12:15.735 --> 12:21.196
The blond is my ex-wife. <br/>The woman touching her is her...

12:21.607 --> 12:24.701
...close, personal friend.

12:26.178 --> 12:31.343
-They're lovers? <br/>-lf you want to put a label on it.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.452
-Anything else I should know? <br/>-Nope. That's it.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.856
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

12:44.363 --> 12:48.424
I always forget that part.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.125
Hello!

12:56.208 --> 13:02.272
Now we need sage branches <br/>and the sacramental wine.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.479
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.983
That's okay!

13:12.758 --> 13:17.593
Now we need the semen <br/>of a righteous man.

13:22.301 --> 13:27.762
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing <br/>the ritual in the first place.

13:27.973 --> 13:32.535
-Can we start throwing things in? <br/>-Yeah, okay!

13:35.247 --> 13:37.977
Okay. <br/>Barry's letters.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.846
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

13:41.020 --> 13:46.322
And I have the receipt <br/>from my dinner with....

13:49.161 --> 13:52.688
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked! <br/>-Let me see!

13:52.898 --> 13:56.265
-He's wearing a sweater. <br/>-No.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.109
-Whose MCl card is that? <br/>-Mine. Shoot!

14:04.310 --> 14:09.009
Remember this number: <br/>Nine, seven, four....

14:10.449 --> 14:14.215
Okay, and here we have <br/>the last of Paolo's grappa.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.048
Wait, isn't it almost pure

14:21.260 --> 14:25.060
How can I dump this woman <br/>on Valentine's Day?

14:25.264 --> 14:28.893
I don't know. <br/>You dumped her on New Year's.

14:29.401 --> 14:33.770
In my next life, <br/>I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

14:35.140 --> 14:38.541
Hello, funny valentine!

14:38.744 --> 14:41.235
Hi, just Janice.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.382
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.849
I could just kiss you all over, <br/>and I'm gonna.

14:52.791 --> 14:56.727
If you don't do it, I will.

15:15.481 --> 15:21.010
-So are you actually from New York? <br/>-Not originally. I'm from

15:21.186 --> 15:25.282
-You said they'd shoot it without you. <br/>-I thought they could.

15:25.491 --> 15:31.430
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake. <br/>Mini-pads should be that much easier.

15:31.597 --> 15:35.556
-It's Valentine's Day. <br/>-I know, but it's my job.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.897
I'll try to get back <br/>as soon as I can.

15:39.171 --> 15:42.265
I'm spending most of my time <br/>teaching science...

15:42.474 --> 15:47.241
...which is funny because <br/>that wasn't even my major.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.450
Now, that is funny!

16:03.696 --> 16:09.032
Do you think it would be too weird <br/>if I invited Carol over to join us?

16:09.201 --> 16:14.764
Because she's alone now. <br/>And pregnant. And sad.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.933
-I guess. <br/>-Are you sure? Carol!

16:19.111 --> 16:21.944
-Wanna join us? <br/>-No, I'm fine.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.446
Come on. <br/>These people will scooch down.

16:26.552 --> 16:31.956
You guys will scooch, won't you? <br/>Let's try scooching! Come on!

16:32.157 --> 16:35.285
-Come on. <br/>-Thank you.

16:36.562 --> 16:40.726
IKristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. <br/>Carol, Kristen.

16:40.966 --> 16:44.732
-How do you do? <br/>-Carol teaches sixth grade.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.605
And Kristen....

16:50.743 --> 16:54.076
IKristen does something...

16:54.613 --> 16:57.810
...that, funnily enough...

16:58.183 --> 17:01.778
...wasn't even her major!

17:03.722 --> 17:08.216
-Thanks for coming over. <br/>-Not at all. It's pretty much our job.

17:08.427 --> 17:11.191
That's why we get the cool hats.

17:11.397 --> 17:15.834
-What do we got there? <br/>-A piece of sik boxer shorts.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.367
Some greeting cards.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.831
A half-charred picture of....

17:22.041 --> 17:25.204
That guy's hairier than the chief!

17:28.113 --> 17:32.015
It's a really funny story <br/>how this happened.

17:32.217 --> 17:37.553
I was taking out the trash, <br/>and Phoebe was burning incense

17:37.723 --> 17:39.088
It's all right.

17:39.291 --> 17:44.354
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire <br/>we've seen get out of control.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.430
-Third one tonight. <br/>-Really?

17:47.599 --> 17:51.797
Valentine's is our <br/>busiest night of the year.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.139
Next time you're burning <br/>your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

17:57.342 --> 18:00.243
One, do it in a well-ventilated area.

18:00.446 --> 18:05.611
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing, <br/>stay away from synthetic fabrics.

18:05.818 --> 18:11.484
Three, try to let go of the anger, <br/>and learn to love yourself.

18:13.592 --> 18:17.494
-I brought you something. <br/>-ls it loaded?

18:20.899 --> 18:26.895
Oh, little candy hearts. <br/>"Chan and Jan Forever."

18:27.573 --> 18:30.371
I had them made special.

18:33.479 --> 18:36.243
Okay, Janice.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.146
Hey, Janice.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.220
There's no way to tell you this.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.881
At least, there's no new way.

18:51.029 --> 18:55.159
I just don't think things <br/>are gonna work out.

18:56.535 --> 19:00.130
That's fine.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.471
It is?

19:03.675 --> 19:08.635
Because I know that this <br/>isn't the end.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.739
You see, actually, it is.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.750
No, because you won't let that happen.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.784
Don't you know it yet?

19:16.955 --> 19:21.392
You love me, Chandler Bing!

19:24.096 --> 19:26.189
Oh, no, I don't.

19:25.865 --> 19:30.859
Why do we keep ending up together? <br/>New Year's, who invited who?

19:30.570 --> 19:34.597
-Valentine's, who asked who into bed? <br/>-I did, but

19:34.774 --> 19:36.401
You seek me out!

19:36.543 --> 19:41.571
Something deep in your soul <br/>calls out to me like a foghorn!

19:41.781 --> 19:45.581
Janice! Janice!

19:45.852 --> 19:49.913
You push me away, <br/>you pull me back!

19:50.323 --> 19:52.883
You want me. You need me.

19:53.092 --> 19:57.995
You can't live without me. <br/>And you know it.

19:58.398 --> 20:03.836
You just don't know you know it.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.534
See?

20:14.247 --> 20:16.909
Call me!

20:24.091 --> 20:28.118
It's not true. <br/>I never called your mother a wolverine.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.660
You did so, I swear to

20:34.735 --> 20:37.863
How long has she been in the bathroom?

20:38.071 --> 20:41.302
She isn't in the bathroom. <br/>Her coat's gone.

20:41.475 --> 20:45.138
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

20:45.979 --> 20:49.176
I screwed up my first date <br/>in nine years.

20:49.416 --> 20:53.045
-That could be it. <br/>-Oh, God.

20:53.186 --> 20:57.122
You know, this is still pretty hot.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.591
Mushroom.

21:02.896 --> 21:04.955
Smile.

21:05.165 --> 21:09.693
They won't all be like this. <br/>Some might stay through dinner.

21:09.903 --> 21:13.100
-I'm sorry. That's not funny. <br/>-It's just....

21:13.306 --> 21:16.867
You know the whole <br/>"get on with your life" thing?

21:17.077 --> 21:19.375
Well, do I have to?

21:19.579 --> 21:24.414
I'm sitting here <br/>with this cute woman...

21:24.651 --> 21:27.745
...and she's perfectly nice, but that...

21:30.123 --> 21:32.091
...that's it.

21:32.292 --> 21:37.229
Then I'm here talking to you, <br/>and it's easy and it's fun.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.931
And I don't have to....

21:40.333 --> 21:42.824
-I know. <br/>-You know?

21:46.039 --> 21:49.167
Here's a wacky thought.

21:49.376 --> 21:53.073
Let's say you and I give it <br/>another shot.

21:53.246 --> 21:56.773
I know what you're gonna say. <br/>You're a lesbian.

21:57.851 --> 22:02.754
But what do you say we just <br/>put that aside for now.

22:02.956 --> 22:05.618
Let's just stick a pin in it.

22:05.826 --> 22:11.731
Because we're great together. <br/>You can't deny it.

22:12.098 --> 22:16.034
I've got a ring at home <br/>that fits you.

22:16.236 --> 22:21.071
I've got lots of pictures <br/>with both of us in them.

22:21.274 --> 22:25.472
And best of all, <br/>you're carrying my baby.

22:25.679 --> 22:28.375
-I mean, how perfect is that? <br/>-Ross

22:28.548 --> 22:34.214
You keep saying that, but there's <br/>something right here. I love you.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.962
I love you too.

22:44.431 --> 22:46.831
-But <br/>-No "but."

22:48.068 --> 22:53.096
You know that thing we <br/>put over here with the pin in it?

22:54.241 --> 22:58.575
It's time to take the pin out.

23:03.350 --> 23:07.252
You'll find someone. <br/>The right woman is waiting for you.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.980
It's easy for you to say. <br/>You found one already.

23:12.859 --> 23:16.955
All you need is a woman who likes men, <br/>and you'll be set.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.901
Not her.

23:33.847 --> 23:37.943
So, you guys really slide down a pole?

23:40.420 --> 23:44.447
-Absolutely. <br/>-That's so cool.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.650
How do you get back up?

23:49.562 --> 23:54.192
Well, we rarely have to return <br/>from a fire as quickly.

23:57.237 --> 23:59.865
So, would you guys....

24:00.073 --> 24:04.942
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....

24:05.145 --> 24:07.113
Go for a drink sometime?

24:07.314 --> 24:08.679
Sure, sounds good.

24:08.882 --> 24:12.215
We get off at midnight. <br/>We'll pick you up then.

24:12.419 --> 24:14.080
Okay. Great!

24:15.055 --> 24:18.786
So will you bring the truck?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.720
I'll even let you ring the bell.

24:22.929 --> 24:26.729
-We'll see you later. <br/>-Bye! See you later!

24:27.934 --> 24:29.231
Oh, my God!

24:30.370 --> 24:33.134
See? There you go. <br/>The cleansing worked.

24:33.340 --> 24:36.400
You're right. They're nice guys!

24:36.576 --> 24:40.444
They're firemen guys!

24:40.613 --> 24:44.982
-Tell them you're married? <br/>-No. My girlfriend doesn't even know.
