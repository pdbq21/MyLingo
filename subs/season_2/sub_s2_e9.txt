WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:08.372
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.277
You should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

00:16.950 --> 00:18.577
How much did you tip the super?

00:18.986 --> 00:22.217
We were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.421
This year we made him cookies.

00:25.726 --> 00:26.886
And 25 it is.

00:28.829 --> 00:29.853
You gave cookies?

00:30.063 --> 00:31.963
Money is so impersonal.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.929
Cookies says someone cares.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.968
We're broke,
but cookies do say that.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.262
I can see that.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.567
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

00:45.779 --> 00:49.271
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these "funny" brownies?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.114
Not especially.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.317
But I think they had pot in them.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.923
So who else did you tip
with cookies?

01:00.794 --> 01:03.126
The mailman, the super....

01:03.697 --> 01:05.688
And the newspaper delivery guy.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.668
Oh, my God.

01:08.936 --> 01:09.766
What?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.272
You're not gonna like this.

01:15.776 --> 01:19.109
These are cookies smashed
to the sports section.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.173
He did my crossword puzzle.

01:21.381 --> 01:25.784
Yeah, but not very well, unless
14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

01:26.019 --> 01:29.011
...actually is "Bite me,
bite me, bite me."

01:30.123 --> 01:32.216
The One With Phoebe's Dad

02:17.339 --> 02:19.671
I can't believe
it's Christmas already.

02:20.175 --> 02:23.042
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

02:23.245 --> 02:26.146
...Iords are a-leaping
and geese are a-laying.

02:27.650 --> 02:31.313
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

02:32.655 --> 02:33.815
Hey, guys.

02:36.592 --> 02:37.581
Hey, Rach.

02:38.093 --> 02:40.926
I got you a little present.

02:43.165 --> 02:44.132
I'll open it.

02:46.168 --> 02:47.192
It's a Slinky!

02:48.470 --> 02:49.494
Remember?

02:49.705 --> 02:51.969
Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs

02:52.174 --> 02:54.039
Everyone knows it's

02:55.778 --> 02:57.370
Just a big spring.

02:58.547 --> 03:00.811
You're still mad
because of the whole

03:01.016 --> 03:03.348
Horrible list of reasons
not to be with me?

03:03.552 --> 03:06.885
How about we just call it
the "unfortunate incident"?

03:09.959 --> 03:12.826
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

03:13.395 --> 03:14.885
Go nuts.

03:17.032 --> 03:18.021
Hey, guys.

03:20.135 --> 03:21.568
What's in the bag?

03:22.304 --> 03:23.328
Some presents.

03:23.539 --> 03:25.530
Come on, show us what you bought.

03:26.008 --> 03:27.703
You know you want to.

03:33.048 --> 03:36.347
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

03:36.552 --> 03:38.042
Oh, that's cute.

03:38.253 --> 03:41.347
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

03:44.893 --> 03:47.657
And I got this blouse for Mom.

03:48.063 --> 03:49.496
Ross, that is gorgeous!

03:50.165 --> 03:52.895
Look at these authentic fake metals!

03:53.168 --> 03:55.261
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

03:55.504 --> 03:58.098
...at the make-believe
military academy!

04:01.710 --> 04:03.905
Happy "Christmas Eve" Eve.

04:05.014 --> 04:06.845
Oh, my God!
Where did you get this?

04:07.116 --> 04:09.949
Macy's, third floor,
home furnishings.

04:10.185 --> 04:11.413
This is my father!

04:11.620 --> 04:14.111
This is a picture of my dad!

04:16.725 --> 04:19.353
That's the guy
that comes in the frame.

04:19.595 --> 04:21.859
No, it's my dad.
I'll show you.

04:22.264 --> 04:24.232
I thought your dad was in prison.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.060
No, that's my stepdad.

04:26.268 --> 04:29.567
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

04:29.938 --> 04:31.735
How have you never been on Oprah?

04:33.642 --> 04:35.610
Look, see? This is him.

04:35.878 --> 04:39.473
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

04:42.618 --> 04:44.779
This is a picture of the frame guy...

04:44.987 --> 04:48.115
...posing in front of
a blue screen with a collie.

04:48.624 --> 04:51.491
It's not a blue screen.
It's just....

04:51.760 --> 04:54.490
Maybe it was just
really clear that day.

04:56.965 --> 04:59.627
Okay, I have to talk
to my grandmother.

05:00.102 --> 05:01.467
Wait a minute, honey!

05:06.975 --> 05:09.944
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

05:12.414 --> 05:15.508
But when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

05:18.253 --> 05:20.744
Esther Livingston.

05:22.591 --> 05:23.615
Gone!

05:26.028 --> 05:27.120
Hi, Pooh.

05:27.763 --> 05:29.924
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

05:30.132 --> 05:32.760
Just updating the phone book.

05:34.103 --> 05:35.035
Gram?

05:36.371 --> 05:38.601
Can I see the pictures
of my dad again?

05:40.776 --> 05:41.834
Sure, sure.

05:43.512 --> 05:44.444
How come?

05:44.680 --> 05:47.342
Just, you know, to see him.

05:47.549 --> 05:48.880
Sure. Here.

05:51.153 --> 05:54.020
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

05:55.023 --> 05:58.390
And helping a little boy fly a kite.

05:59.194 --> 06:01.992
And here he is at a graduation.

06:03.565 --> 06:05.192
Another graduation.

06:08.070 --> 06:09.867
Another graduation.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.637
Is this really my father?

06:14.143 --> 06:16.373
Is it really your fa?

06:17.646 --> 06:19.375
Well, of course it is.

06:20.182 --> 06:23.549
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

06:25.988 --> 06:28.855
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

06:29.091 --> 06:30.388
...you've never lied.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.094
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

06:38.567 --> 06:39.534
Oh, God.

06:40.335 --> 06:42.428
It was your mother's idea.

06:42.704 --> 06:45.070
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

06:45.274 --> 06:47.208
... because he hurt her so much.

06:47.776 --> 06:49.403
I didn't want to do it.

06:49.611 --> 06:52.944
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

06:54.883 --> 06:57.249
Not impossible, but harder.

06:58.220 --> 07:01.712
All right. So he's not
a famous tree surgeon?

07:06.128 --> 07:10.462
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut
in Burma where there's no phones?

07:11.266 --> 07:14.360
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.197
That makes no sense.

07:16.405 --> 07:19.465
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

07:21.476 --> 07:22.738
Honey.

07:26.148 --> 07:29.140
Anyway, that's all I know.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.812
That...

07:34.990 --> 07:36.457
...and this.

07:39.795 --> 07:40.887
This...

07:41.830 --> 07:43.730
...is the real him.

07:48.770 --> 07:51.898
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

07:52.140 --> 07:55.234
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

07:55.477 --> 07:58.469
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

07:58.747 --> 08:03.150
... but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

08:03.585 --> 08:06.645
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

08:06.922 --> 08:08.981
Who said anything about Christmas?

08:12.794 --> 08:14.694
Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

08:14.930 --> 08:16.090
No, nothing.

08:16.465 --> 08:17.762
I hope she's okay.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.991
I know exactly
what she's going through.

08:20.769 --> 08:22.498
How do you know that?

08:22.971 --> 08:24.302
She told us.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.438
What do you got there, Monica?

08:29.678 --> 08:30.872
Stuff for the party.

08:31.113 --> 08:34.014
Aren't you guys
supposed to be shopping?

08:34.216 --> 08:35.808
You didn't buy presents yet?

08:36.051 --> 08:38.781
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

08:38.987 --> 08:41.854
Don't you have to be
Claymation to say that?

08:43.859 --> 08:46.726
I don't think the mailman
liked your cookies.

08:46.962 --> 08:48.793
The ornaments your mom sent.

08:53.468 --> 08:57.404
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

08:57.639 --> 09:00.506
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

09:08.817 --> 09:09.875
Hey, Rach.

09:10.152 --> 09:13.053
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

09:13.255 --> 09:15.985
How about you make a list about me?

09:16.191 --> 09:18.421
Forget it.
I'm not gonna stand here...

09:18.660 --> 09:19.820
...and make a list

09:20.062 --> 09:21.996
Okay, you're whiny...

09:22.230 --> 09:25.461
...you are obsessive,
you are insecure...

09:25.667 --> 09:27.032
...you're gutless.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.260
You don't ever just "seize the day."

09:29.571 --> 09:33.598
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

09:33.842 --> 09:37.005
And you wear too much
of that gel in your hair.

09:40.582 --> 09:42.209
See, there....

09:42.451 --> 09:44.885
All right, you did what I said.

09:45.354 --> 09:48.448
And you know what?
You're right. I do feel better.

09:48.690 --> 09:49.679
Thank you, Ross.

09:55.764 --> 09:59.928
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

10:01.403 --> 10:03.633
Okay. In lthaca?

10:05.273 --> 10:07.241
All right, Saratoga?

10:08.310 --> 10:09.470
Oneonta?

10:10.746 --> 10:14.113
You know what? You shouldn't
call yourself lnformation!

10:20.489 --> 10:24.084
Hello, Grandma. If that is,
in fact, your real name.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.054
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

10:29.464 --> 10:32.228
-How's it going?
-Not so good.

10:33.268 --> 10:36.760
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

10:37.606 --> 10:40.473
Well, I think you're
better off without him.

10:41.276 --> 10:43.403
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

10:43.645 --> 10:46.773
But to me, he's still
the irresponsible creep...

10:46.982 --> 10:50.577
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

10:52.020 --> 10:56.252
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

10:58.326 --> 10:59.759
Yeah, I know.

11:02.531 --> 11:06.558
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I said I didn't know...

11:06.768 --> 11:08.998
...exactly where he lived.

11:09.337 --> 11:10.964
What do you mean?

11:11.173 --> 11:15.200
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive
in Middletown.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.106
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

11:20.315 --> 11:22.180
You can take my cab.

11:24.186 --> 11:25.175
Thank you.

11:26.721 --> 11:30.122
-Nobody else drives that cab.
-Got it.

11:31.726 --> 11:33.785
I'm gonna see my dad!

11:34.362 --> 11:35.294
Thank you.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.627
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

11:51.512 --> 11:53.139
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

11:53.347 --> 11:55.474
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

11:55.682 --> 11:56.910
Hop in!

11:57.785 --> 12:00.447
She'd better get here.
The stores close at 7.

12:00.654 --> 12:03.452
It'll be two hours
to Phoebe's dad's house...

12:03.657 --> 12:05.750
...they'll meet, chat,
swap life stories.

12:08.259 --> 12:09.954
We'll have plenty of time.

12:11.463 --> 12:13.328
Hey, here she comes!

12:21.840 --> 12:22.966
Can you believe this?

12:23.341 --> 12:26.276
In, like, two hours
I'm gonna have a dad.

12:27.412 --> 12:28.811
Yeah, big stuff!

12:29.180 --> 12:30.477
Okay, let's go!

12:30.682 --> 12:32.650
Here, you have to hold this.

12:36.121 --> 12:38.021
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

12:38.957 --> 12:40.288
That's my cheat sheet.

12:44.162 --> 12:46.960
-Where's my seat belt?
-There isn't one.

12:47.198 --> 12:49.462
The paramedics had to cut through it.

13:01.613 --> 13:04.446
Come on, just tell me.
Please, please!

13:04.716 --> 13:08.618
For the 16th time:
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

13:10.455 --> 13:13.219
-It's hot in here!
-Rach, get the heat.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.688
Ross, turn the heat down, please?

13:16.194 --> 13:18.355
The difference between obsessive

13:18.630 --> 13:19.688
Ross, the heat!

13:19.898 --> 13:23.857
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?

13:26.137 --> 13:28.037
This way is on.

13:28.239 --> 13:30.503
So this is...

13:33.077 --> 13:34.135
...off.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.009
Did you just break the radiator?

13:38.216 --> 13:40.912
No, I was turning the knob and...

13:41.319 --> 13:42.843
... here it is.

13:43.588 --> 13:45.522
Well, put it back!

13:48.726 --> 13:50.421
It won't go back.

13:50.662 --> 13:51.720
I'll call the super.

13:51.996 --> 13:53.327
Here, let me try.

13:53.531 --> 13:56.989
That's right. I forgot about
your ability to fuse metal.

13:58.069 --> 13:59.730
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

13:59.938 --> 14:00.996
... Not Funny!

14:01.506 --> 14:02.768
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

14:03.007 --> 14:04.907
It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

14:05.176 --> 14:08.202
Yes, somebody broke our knob
on the radiator...

14:08.413 --> 14:10.779
...and it's really hot in here.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.410
Yes, it's hot enough
to bake cookies.

14:17.021 --> 14:19.353
Could we have a new one by 6?

14:20.124 --> 14:22.456
Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

14:22.727 --> 14:24.285
We're having a party tonight.

14:24.529 --> 14:26.019
Okay, tip the man.

14:26.231 --> 14:28.529
If he doesn't like
our cookies, too bad.

14:28.733 --> 14:29.961
I won't be blackmailed.

14:30.235 --> 14:32.465
Look, if it gets a little warm...

14:32.770 --> 14:34.397
...it can be a theme party.

14:34.639 --> 14:37.403
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

14:40.845 --> 14:42.005
This is it!

14:42.313 --> 14:43.337
Seventy-four.

14:45.850 --> 14:48.080
So that's what this is for!

14:49.587 --> 14:52.249
This is it.
I'm gonna meet my dad.

14:52.657 --> 14:54.818
This is like
the biggest thing ever.

14:55.593 --> 14:57.060
Sure is.

14:57.261 --> 14:58.922
Here I go. I'm going in.

14:59.163 --> 14:59.993
All right!

15:00.264 --> 15:01.856
Good luck, Pheebs.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.159
Here I go.

15:07.038 --> 15:08.528
Here I go.

15:10.274 --> 15:11.673
I'm going.

15:25.123 --> 15:27.683
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party.

15:27.959 --> 15:31.451
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

15:33.965 --> 15:36.399
It's hard to tell
because I'm sweating...

15:36.634 --> 15:39.660
... but I use exactly
what the gel bottle says.

15:42.140 --> 15:46.543
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

15:49.347 --> 15:50.473
Ice?

15:51.082 --> 15:54.574
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

15:56.754 --> 15:57.982
Monica!

15:59.657 --> 16:02.148
Your guests are turning into jerky.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.521
Really?
I'm perfectly comfortable.

16:05.329 --> 16:07.820
Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.564
Mr. Treeger.

16:13.905 --> 16:15.338
You said there was a party.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.202
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

16:19.443 --> 16:22.571
Is it hot?
My body always stays cool.

16:22.847 --> 16:25.042
Probably because I have so much skin.

16:26.284 --> 16:27.945
Hey, cheese!

16:29.720 --> 16:32.382
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

16:32.590 --> 16:35.718
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

16:35.927 --> 16:37.519
No, I will not cave.

16:37.728 --> 16:38.626
I'm with Mon.

16:38.863 --> 16:42.196
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

16:42.433 --> 16:45.732
Even though he's your super,
I'm seizing.

16:47.638 --> 16:48.900
Mr. Treeger?

16:50.141 --> 16:52.735
Here is $50.
Merry Christmas.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.109
I didn't get you anything.

16:56.781 --> 16:58.408
Here's five back.

16:59.550 --> 17:02.314
No, that's your Christmas tip.

17:02.553 --> 17:07.081
Do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

17:07.291 --> 17:09.452
No can do.
Like I told the girl...

17:09.760 --> 17:11.489
... I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

17:12.363 --> 17:13.295
Ross?

17:14.131 --> 17:15.792
He's playing baseball.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.627
You mean hardball?

17:21.239 --> 17:22.263
Whatever.

17:23.074 --> 17:24.098
What you gonna do?

17:24.308 --> 17:26.435
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

17:26.644 --> 17:27.906
Mr. Treeger?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.804
Here's another 50.

17:31.282 --> 17:32.510
Happy Hanukkah.

17:33.017 --> 17:36.111
Will this help
with the knob-getting?

17:37.688 --> 17:40.350
No, the place is not open
till Tuesday.

17:41.025 --> 17:43.016
Am I not saying it right?

17:44.462 --> 17:46.862
So you really did like my cookies?

17:47.098 --> 17:50.864
Yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.101
Nice seizing...

17:58.342 --> 17:59.934
...gel boy.

18:04.615 --> 18:06.549
Is this mistletoe?

18:08.552 --> 18:10.179
No, that....

18:10.454 --> 18:12.217
That is basil.

18:15.993 --> 18:19.019
If it was mistletoe,
I was gonna kiss you.

18:21.332 --> 18:22.959
No, it's still basil.

18:25.569 --> 18:30.165
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

18:32.510 --> 18:36.412
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

18:38.916 --> 18:40.645
-How far did you get?
-Mailbox.

18:40.851 --> 18:43.513
All right, we're getting closer.

18:45.323 --> 18:46.483
What's going on?

18:47.358 --> 18:50.020
It's just like
a whole mess of stuff.

18:50.261 --> 18:54.823
Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

18:55.066 --> 18:58.502
And you know, now he's
a pharmacist guy and....

18:58.703 --> 19:02.833
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

19:03.074 --> 19:06.908
Yeah, maybe!
And I'll knock on the door...

19:07.578 --> 19:10.843
...and he'll hug me,
and I'll have a dad!

19:11.082 --> 19:14.711
I'll go to his pharmacy and
everyone will be nice to me...

19:14.952 --> 19:17.750
... because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

19:17.955 --> 19:19.354
So why not go knock?

19:23.194 --> 19:27.961
Because, I mean, what if
he's not this great-dad guy?

19:28.799 --> 19:33.395
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

19:38.442 --> 19:39.807
You know what?

19:40.478 --> 19:43.140
I've already lost
a fake dad this week.

19:44.715 --> 19:47.115
I don't think I'm ready
to lose a real one.

19:49.620 --> 19:53.317
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

19:56.260 --> 19:59.787
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

19:59.997 --> 20:02.830
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

20:03.901 --> 20:05.391
You guys....

20:09.607 --> 20:11.131
Sorry about your shopping.

20:11.342 --> 20:14.243
Oh, that's okay.
We'll figure something out.

20:16.947 --> 20:19.142
I know you're not going in there...

20:19.350 --> 20:22.786
... but you think it's okay
if I go in and use his bathroom?

20:23.821 --> 20:25.686
That's fine, never mind.

20:27.491 --> 20:28.981
Cool, snow!

20:29.193 --> 20:31.127
Kind of like a blank canvas.

20:41.205 --> 20:44.299
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,
is it hot in here!

20:46.644 --> 20:48.703
You mind if I turn the heat down?

20:48.946 --> 20:52.177
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

20:52.616 --> 20:54.277
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

20:54.685 --> 20:56.846
Oh, I couldn't go in.

20:57.054 --> 20:59.022
-Honey, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

20:59.223 --> 21:01.987
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

21:02.193 --> 21:04.127
So that's enough for now.

21:04.328 --> 21:07.491
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

21:07.698 --> 21:10.633
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

21:12.837 --> 21:14.134
The knob was broken...

21:14.338 --> 21:17.830
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

21:37.553 --> 21:39.578
Rach, these are for you.

21:40.556 --> 21:42.080
Wiper blades!

21:42.859 --> 21:44.554
I don't even have a car.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.856
No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do!

21:51.868 --> 21:53.859
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

21:57.974 --> 21:59.601
Toilet-seat covers!

22:02.745 --> 22:05.407
Is that what you did
while I got gas?

22:05.781 --> 22:07.442
You guys!

22:08.551 --> 22:09.643
And for Ross...

22:09.919 --> 22:11.580
... Mr. Sweet Tooth.

22:15.391 --> 22:17.325
You got me a cola drink?

22:18.494 --> 22:20.291
And a lemon-lime!

22:22.331 --> 22:27.200
Well, this is too much! I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

22:29.438 --> 22:31.531
And last, but not least....

22:33.943 --> 22:36.104
They're ribbed for your pleasure!
