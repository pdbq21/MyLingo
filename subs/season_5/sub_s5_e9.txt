WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:05.766
What am I sitting on?

00:06.272 --> 00:07.739
Top of the world?

00:08.074 --> 00:09.837
Dock of the bay?

00:10.877 --> 00:11.935
I'm out.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.038
Oh, undies!

00:19.219 --> 00:21.050
Whose are they?

00:21.287 --> 00:23.414
-Whose are they?
-Not mine.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.351
Joey's!
Got to be Joey's.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.185
They're mine.

00:31.464 --> 00:34.262
See, Joey's.
They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.365
Why are they here?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.629
I don't know.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.373
I'm Joey.

00:43.410 --> 00:44.468
I'm disgusting.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.441
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.

00:49.315 --> 00:52.443
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.047
-Take them!
-I got them.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.252
You can touch them.
They're yours.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.124
Chandler? A word?

01:16.576 --> 01:20.842
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.810
Tighty-whiteys?
What are you, 8?

01:26.352 --> 01:28.411
Thank you, Joey, so much.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.155
You're not welcome, okay?

01:30.690 --> 01:34.251
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.

01:34.494 --> 01:38.021
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.

01:38.264 --> 01:42.360
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.369
Then one thing led
to another, and....

01:51.845 --> 01:54.871
And around the ankles,
that is a tough spot.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.810
It was.
All right, listen

01:57.050 --> 01:59.450
All this lying has been
hard on us too.

01:59.686 --> 02:02.280
Yeah, I bet all the sex
makes it easier.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.648
Yeah, actually.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.425
Meanwhile, I get Rachel shoving your
underwear in my face...

02:09.596 --> 02:12.895
...and asking when she can
come see me star in Ugly Woman.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.732
We'll be more careful.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.905
We don't want them to know
because it's going really well.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.700
And maybe it's going well
because it's a secret.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.469
It sounds weird,
but we're so bad at relationships.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.746
-We are. Help us!
-Help!

02:31.684 --> 02:35.381
All right.
But you do it with me once.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.753
-Joey!
-Didn't think so.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.529
The One With Ross' Sandwich

03:32.278 --> 03:35.338
-Can we please just drop this?
-But I don't get it.

03:35.515 --> 03:39.383
Does anybody else just take off
their underwear when they're hot?

03:43.856 --> 03:44.914
What are you reading?

03:45.658 --> 03:46.647
Wuthering Heights.

03:46.859 --> 03:50.920
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.428
You're taking a class?
That's so cool.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.769
I really liked
that Lamaze class I took.

03:57.036 --> 04:00.699
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...

04:01.007 --> 04:03.305
...with a less painful final exam.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.201
That sounds like fun.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.707
Oh, you should come with me!

04:08.948 --> 04:11.109
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.182
Do you have time to read it?

04:15.388 --> 04:16.377
I read it in school.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.615
This is going to be so much fun!
I have to finish.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.362
But what time does the class start?

04:31.938 --> 04:32.927
What's wrong, buddy?

04:33.139 --> 04:35.539
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.568
What did the police say?

04:40.580 --> 04:43.549
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.648
I can't believe someone ate it.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.113
It's just a sandwich.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.945
Just a sandwich?

04:49.222 --> 04:51.122
I am 30 years old, okay?

04:51.391 --> 04:53.723
I'll be divorced twice and
I got evicted.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.157
That sandwich was
the only good thing in my life!

04:57.397 --> 05:01.231
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!

05:03.236 --> 05:04.498
That's a nice sweater vest.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.103
I have enough
for one more sandwich.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.902
I was going to eat it myself, but....

05:13.346 --> 05:17.043
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.247
I still can't believe
someone ate it!

05:22.422 --> 05:24.686
Look, I left a note and everything.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.291
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

05:27.560 --> 05:29.357
"Ross Geller's lunch."

05:30.263 --> 05:32.288
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

05:32.699 --> 05:36.396
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"

05:38.104 --> 05:40.368
I'm surprised
you didn't wear it home.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.870
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.636
I learned that on the street.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.035
Really?

05:48.614 --> 05:50.411
What would you say, Phoebe?

05:50.650 --> 05:54.746
Stuff like:
"Keep your mitts off my grub."

05:56.322 --> 06:00.782
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of Annie?

06:03.429 --> 06:06.330
This'll keep them away
from your stuff.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.773
Phoebe, you are a badass!

06:16.309 --> 06:18.903
Someday I'll tell you
how I stabbed the cop.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.609
He stabbed me first!

06:25.685 --> 06:29.018
The Bronte sisters were remarkable women
for their time.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.620
They lived in a patriarchal society.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.758
Sorry I'm late,
but I left late.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.423
So, what is the book about?

06:39.665 --> 06:41.360
Didn't you read it
in high school?

06:41.601 --> 06:44.661
I started it, but then
there was this pep rally.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.668
And I was on top of the pyramid.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.663
But anyway...

06:48.875 --> 06:49.864
...what's the book about?

06:51.144 --> 06:54.841
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.981
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.

06:58.217 --> 07:02.313
Which I think represent the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.216
I totally get symbolism.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.884
How would you characterize
the theme of this book?

07:09.128 --> 07:11.028
Let's see....
Rachel Greene?

07:16.536 --> 07:20.404
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.373
That's sort of a given...

07:23.576 --> 07:25.544
...but, yes.
Anyone else?

07:26.846 --> 07:27.835
Symbolism!

07:30.883 --> 07:33.249
And the wildness of the moors...

07:33.519 --> 07:35.987
...which I think, is mirrored...

07:36.222 --> 07:39.658
...in the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.721
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here....

07:46.232 --> 07:48.063
You completely stole my answer!

07:48.334 --> 07:50.063
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.566
How would you know?
You didn't read it!

07:54.574 --> 07:57.941
What do you think?
You in the blue shirt?

08:00.613 --> 08:05.243
I think that yours is a question
with many possible answers.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.415
Would you care to venture one?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.520
Would you care to venture one?

08:13.125 --> 08:14.854
Are you just repeating me?

08:15.094 --> 08:17.619
Are you just repeating me?

08:19.866 --> 08:21.424
All right. Let's move on.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.390
Okay, then.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.939
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?

08:30.243 --> 08:32.643
I didn't want him
to think I was stupid.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.972
That was really embarrassing,
what happened to you.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.915
Your note?

08:42.388 --> 08:43.377
Amazing!

08:43.923 --> 08:46.255
Not only did no one
touch my sandwich...

08:46.492 --> 08:49.290
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.558
A guy called me "Mental."

08:51.797 --> 08:53.264
"Mental Geller."

08:53.799 --> 08:56.563
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.

08:57.937 --> 09:01.498
The best you got in high school
was "Wet Pants Geller."

09:01.741 --> 09:03.504
It was the water fountain, okay?!

09:05.645 --> 09:06.669
Anyway...

09:08.414 --> 09:10.405
...people are writing
reports for me...

09:10.616 --> 09:13.141
...pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.614
I tell you,
you get tough with people...

09:15.821 --> 09:18.619
...and you can get
anything you want.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.827
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee! Now!

09:31.704 --> 09:33.262
This was really fun.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.674
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.274
So you still wondering?

09:40.179 --> 09:42.340
No. We just went out.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.507
You're smart.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.617
I like that.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.355
Oh, candles!

09:59.465 --> 10:01.023
What is that, a blanket?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.825
A video camera?
Oh, my God!

10:05.304 --> 10:10.401
I can't believe you thought you'd
tape us having sex on the first date!

10:18.384 --> 10:20.545
Joey, is what she just said....

10:21.854 --> 10:23.048
Oh, my God!

10:23.322 --> 10:24.755
You're actually going

10:29.662 --> 10:31.220
What is going on here?

10:33.866 --> 10:37.097
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?

10:42.508 --> 10:43.873
I'm Joey.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.743
I mean, I'm disgusting.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.614
I make low-budget adult films.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.188
You promised to be more careful!

11:07.466 --> 11:10.526
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!

11:12.772 --> 11:13.761
We're so sorry.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.473
I'm telling everyone.

11:15.675 --> 11:20.476
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!

11:20.846 --> 11:22.507
No, there's a better explanation.

11:22.782 --> 11:26.240
Tell them you had to make
an adult film for your...

11:26.452 --> 11:28.716
...adult film class.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.649
I like that.
But no!

11:31.891 --> 11:35.190
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?

11:36.796 --> 11:37.854
I don't know.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.665
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.993
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.362
All right.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.701
But it better make me
look really good.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.410
And another thing:

11:54.880 --> 11:56.245
The video camera?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.743
Nice!

12:07.493 --> 12:08.653
May I have a word?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.191
Of course, Donald.

12:11.063 --> 12:15.363
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.033
-What?
-Threatening letters...

12:17.336 --> 12:19.167
...refusal to meet deadlines.

12:20.039 --> 12:23.008
Apparently people now
call you Mental.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.939
We want you to speak
to a psychiatrist.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.119
You don't understand.
This is so silly.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.546
This is all just
because of a sandwich.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.057
A sandwich?

12:41.527 --> 12:45.861
You see, my sister makes
these amazing turkey sandwiches.

12:46.198 --> 12:51.135
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.234
I call it "The Moistmaker."

12:54.240 --> 12:57.232
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge....

12:58.244 --> 12:59.472
Oh, you know what?

12:59.745 --> 13:00.939
I'm sorry.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.108
I believe I ate that.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.086
You ate my sandwich?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.817
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.115
Oh, really?

13:15.594 --> 13:20.759
Did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

13:22.835 --> 13:24.564
Do you, perhaps, remember...

13:24.770 --> 13:28.331
...seeing a note on top of it?

13:28.574 --> 13:32.635
There may have been a joke
or limerick of some kind.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.743
That said it was...

13:34.947 --> 13:36.778
...my sandwich!

13:37.650 --> 13:39.117
Now, calm down.

13:39.518 --> 13:42.453
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.293
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.027
You threw my sandwich away?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.033
My sandwich?!

14:03.976 --> 14:05.466
What's this book about?

14:05.711 --> 14:07.042
You didn't read it, either?

14:07.313 --> 14:10.771
I was going to, but I accidentally
read something else.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.844
Vogue.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.651
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.447
No, read it yourself.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.524
Come on,
don't be such a goody-goody.

14:22.461 --> 14:23.689
Fine.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.024
All right.
So, Jane Eyre?

14:27.299 --> 14:29.893
First, you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.534
She's a cyborg.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.505
A cyborg?
Isn't that like a robot?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.512
This book was light years
ahead of its time.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.516
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.144
What did you think of Jane Eyre?

14:48.587 --> 14:53.650
Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.327
Go ahead, Rachel.

14:57.763 --> 14:58.991
Thank you, Phoebe.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.160
What struck me most
when reading Jane Eyre...

15:04.370 --> 15:07.533
...was how the book was
so ahead of its time.

15:07.773 --> 15:11.573
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.

15:13.612 --> 15:17.070
Well, feminism, yes.
But also the robots.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.922
Since that video camera thing
didn't work out...

15:28.861 --> 15:33.230
...I thought that I would give you
just a little preview.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.965
You're naked!

15:36.235 --> 15:37.259
I know!

15:56.055 --> 15:57.283
Are you okay?

15:57.556 --> 15:58.921
I'm fine.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.820
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.250
Why?

16:03.595 --> 16:05.495
On account of my rage.

16:06.598 --> 16:10.261
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.832
He gave me a pill for it.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.332
A pill?

16:16.675 --> 16:20.076
When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...

16:20.312 --> 16:24.612
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.512
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

16:27.753 --> 16:30.017
And I thought it was a good idea.

16:30.255 --> 16:31.813
So I took it.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.590
They're making you take
time off work?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.160
And you're okay with that?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.930
I don't know.

16:40.532 --> 16:43.990
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.

16:44.303 --> 16:47.431
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.038
I hate it when they make me see
the shrink at my office.

16:52.211 --> 16:57.080
He's always like, "Your colleagues will
like you better if you like yourself better."

16:57.249 --> 16:58.807
Who needs that?

16:58.984 --> 17:01.384
-You do.
-I know.

17:03.222 --> 17:07.716
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!

17:07.926 --> 17:09.325
I'm sorry.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.460
It was so funny when you compared
Jane Eyre to Robocop.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.729
That was not funny!

17:19.972 --> 17:23.567
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.776
Come on!
What is the big deal?

17:25.978 --> 17:28.708
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.345
I thought it would be fun.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.913
Fun is good.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.142
But I also wanted to learn.

17:34.386 --> 17:38.880
People talk about what they learned
in high school. I never went.

17:41.493 --> 17:44.053
So you really wanted to learn.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.100
You know, Phoebe,
I just wanted to have fun.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.434
You know who should go?

17:51.703 --> 17:53.762
I know! I know! I know!

17:55.441 --> 17:58.239
Monica, you asked the question.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.293
Oh, my God, that's Monica!

18:22.968 --> 18:26.301
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!

18:27.139 --> 18:28.299
What's going on?

18:28.907 --> 18:30.932
Joey has got a secret peephole!

18:33.045 --> 18:36.242
-Oh, no!
-Yes, he has a naked picture of Monica!

18:36.482 --> 18:40.009
He takes naked pictures of us, then
he eats chicken and looks at them!

18:44.089 --> 18:46.057
Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

18:46.291 --> 18:47.588
Give me that!

18:47.860 --> 18:50.192
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

18:50.429 --> 18:54.729
Let's give our friend a chance
to explain why he's such a big pervert!

18:56.535 --> 18:58.526
I am not a pervert, okay?

18:58.737 --> 19:00.102
It's just....

19:00.372 --> 19:01.361
I just kind of....

19:02.975 --> 19:05.136
I think I can explain this.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.706
Thank you.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.877
Joey's a sex addict.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.045
What?! No, I'm not!

19:13.285 --> 19:15.446
It's okay! It's good!

19:17.222 --> 19:19.087
It's a disease.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.621
I am not a sex addict!

19:21.894 --> 19:23.293
Yes, you are!

19:24.229 --> 19:26.697
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!

19:26.899 --> 19:28.662
No, it isn't. It's not.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.461
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!

19:32.671 --> 19:33.797
What is the truth?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.769
-What's up?
-What's going on?

19:41.747 --> 19:43.647
I slept with Monica.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.347
Well, let's see what everybody
thinks of that.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.255
You slept with my sister?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.834
Yes, but it was

20:04.102 --> 20:06.161
We just did it once, in London.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.197
This is not good for my rage.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.271
Is this true?

20:15.514 --> 20:16.776
Of course, it's true.

20:17.783 --> 20:21.947
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?

20:23.522 --> 20:24.511
Yes, it's true.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.551
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?

20:33.865 --> 20:36.959
That was the underwear
I was wearing that night in London.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.533
Right, Monica?

20:41.873 --> 20:43.841
I guess I wanted to keep it...

20:45.143 --> 20:46.303
...as a souvenir.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.207
My God, Monica!

20:51.250 --> 20:54.549
Are you sure you're not
just a sex addict?

20:57.656 --> 21:00.853
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.

21:02.394 --> 21:06.023
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!

21:07.065 --> 21:09.932
That's why she gave you
a naked picture of herself.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.567
That makes sense.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.595
And the video camera?

21:19.378 --> 21:23.576
I guess I set up the video camera
to try and entice Joey.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.851
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.989
Monica, this has to stop now.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.151
I know, I know.

21:36.328 --> 21:40.822
I know. I will, and I would appreciate
if we all could just...

21:40.999 --> 21:44.662
...drop it immediately, and forever.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.597
Okay. That is, if you can resist me.

21:50.242 --> 21:53.439
-I'll give it my best shot.
-Good luck.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.908
Unbelievable!

21:56.181 --> 21:58.809
You really kept Joey's underwear?

21:59.084 --> 22:01.518
Why? Why would you do that?

22:05.390 --> 22:06.755
I'm Monica.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.359
I'm disgusting.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.993
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

22:19.204 --> 22:23.106
I think we've all learned
who's disgusting and who's not.

22:26.111 --> 22:29.080
Now, I'm going to get back
to my bucket.

22:30.549 --> 22:33.746
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.682
You were making a good point.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.860
I mean, till you got cut off.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.563
What's up with that girl Monica?

22:46.832 --> 22:48.663
I don't know.
I didn't come with her.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.204
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!

22:53.472 --> 22:55.736
I just convinced Carl
to give us a test.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.032
Test?

22:57.309 --> 23:00.142
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!

23:02.314 --> 23:04.976
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
