00:05.071 --> 00:07.096
Joey? Are you in there?

00:07.340 --> 00:09.865
-That's Rachel.
-You have to talk to her.

00:10.043 --> 00:13.809
I can't. Not after the other night.
It's too weird.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.005
Don't tell her I'm here.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.550
Don't eat that!

00:20.954 --> 00:22.182
-Hey!
-Hey, Rachel.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.879
Is Joey here?

00:24.057 --> 00:26.184
-I don't see him. You?
-No.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.851
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.756
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

00:34.234 --> 00:37.829
-What's up?
-I haven't seen him since he said..

00:38.004 --> 00:39.665
how he, you know..

00:39.839 --> 00:42.501
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.439
Why is that bagel on the floor?

00:46.679 --> 00:49.671
-We were playing a game.
-Was Chandler naked?

00:51.785 --> 00:55.152
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

00:55.722 --> 00:58.919
-Sure!
-What? No! No!

00:59.459 --> 01:04.590
All right, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that..?

01:04.764 --> 01:06.595
Tell him I miss him.

01:11.604 --> 01:15.973
-Okay. Did you hear that?
-Yeah. That naked bagel game?

01:18.578 --> 01:22.241
Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty
small hole.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.443
-You've gotta talk to her.
-I can't.

01:26.619 --> 01:30.885
You guys don't know what it's like
to get shot down.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.321
I don't know what that's like?

01:33.493 --> 01:38.430
Until I was 25, I thought the response
to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

01:38.598 --> 01:39.929
No rejection?

01:40.100 --> 01:43.297
I got shot down at fat camp.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.702
Boy, kids are mean
when they're hungry.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.073
So, what do I do?

01:51.277 --> 01:54.474
It's Rachel.
You're gonna never talk to her again?

01:54.647 --> 01:58.811
It's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.783
Yeah, okay.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.683
I forgot this was on your..

02:04.858 --> 02:07.258
We didn't play it!

02:46.599 --> 02:50.000
I'll look at your tea leaves
and tell your fortune.

02:50.203 --> 02:53.263
-You read tea leaves?
-I've done it for years.

02:53.439 --> 02:56.704
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.344
And one of the great joys
of life..

02:59.512 --> 03:02.606
is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

03:02.782 --> 03:05.751
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.650
-Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
-Okay.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.081
I see a ladder.

03:13.259 --> 03:17.161
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.869
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.565
Who's next?

03:27.774 --> 03:29.366
I'm done. Do mine.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.009
Okay.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.542
Oh! Okay, I see a circle.

03:34.847 --> 03:38.442
Which can either mean
you're having a baby..

03:38.651 --> 03:41.415
or you'll make
a scientific discovery!

03:41.588 --> 03:46.150
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

03:46.593 --> 03:50.586
-What does yours say, Pheebs?
-All right.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.189
Wow! Yay!

03:53.366 --> 03:57.564
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!
And really soon!

03:57.737 --> 04:00.103
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.

04:00.273 --> 04:04.175
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.149
Has anyone seen my shirt?

04:10.316 --> 04:13.979
It's a button-down, like
a faded salmon color?

04:14.187 --> 04:16.451
You mean your pink shirt?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.324
Faded salmon color?

04:19.492 --> 04:22.052
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.892
I must have left it at Mona's.
I knew it!

04:26.065 --> 04:29.466
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.666
That's my favorite shirt.
I love it.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.831
Ask Mona to give it back.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.840
I don't know. I could.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.606
We didn't really end things
on good terms.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.911
If I went, I'd be ignoring the
one thing she asked me to do..

04:46.085 --> 04:48.849
jump up my own ass and die.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.019
Oh, wait a second, you guys?

04:55.361 --> 04:58.353
I've been seeing that guy
everywhere I go.

04:58.531 --> 05:02.023
We take the same bus,
go to the same bookstore.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.896
Maybe he's the tea guy.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.638
Did you see that?

05:08.808 --> 05:12.539
He totally checked you out!
And he is so cute!

05:16.049 --> 05:20.213
Mine is a picture of the Village
People. What does that mean?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.747
Hi.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.620
Hey.

05:39.572 --> 05:42.200
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.217
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!

06:00.159 --> 06:02.821
I thought Joey and l
would be okay..

06:02.995 --> 06:05.589
but we don't know
how to be together.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.665
By the way,
I've been meaning to say this.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.667
If you guys knew about this,
a heads-up would have been nice.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.498
Just a little, you know.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.367
"Joey loves you.
Be prepared."

06:15.708 --> 06:18.404
-Sorry.
-Well, for next time.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.406
-It's tough, but things will improve.
-How do you know?

06:23.583 --> 06:26.051
What if it gets worse and worse..

06:26.219 --> 06:30.019
to the point where we
can't be in the same room?

06:30.189 --> 06:32.419
I'm not great at the advice.

06:32.592 --> 06:36.050
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

06:37.063 --> 06:39.429
Some cheese?

06:42.135 --> 06:46.435
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

06:46.606 --> 06:50.542
If I can't find the right case,
I use the nearest one.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.438
-Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
-The James Taylor case.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.378
-Where is that CD?
-I'll save you time.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.145
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

07:02.054 --> 07:06.684
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

07:06.859 --> 07:10.488
We'll just have to put the CDs
in their right cases.

07:10.663 --> 07:14.963
If we do that, we should
come up with some kind of order.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.595
We have to talk this through.

07:17.770 --> 07:23.834
Oh, my God, you have such
problems! I feel so terrible for you!

07:24.243 --> 07:26.643
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

07:26.813 --> 07:30.146
You're both focusing on
this uncomfortable thing.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.284
Change the subject.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.586
Get him talking about something else.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.347
Yeah, that makes sense.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.822
Maybe you need his advice
on a work problem..

07:41.160 --> 07:42.957
-I could do that.
-Good.

07:43.996 --> 07:46.430
The Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.863
They were just giving those away
at the store.

07:50.169 --> 07:53.138
In exchange for money.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.169
Hey.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.473
I really don't know what to tell you.

08:04.650 --> 08:09.280
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.785
-What?
-Yeah, Joey, she's..

08:12.959 --> 08:17.794
Rachel's got this big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher.

08:17.964 --> 08:22.901
Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.466
Yeah, Joey, maybe
you could help her out.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.304
-Okay.
-Oh, and you know what?

08:27.473 --> 08:29.373
While you're helping
solve this problem..

08:29.542 --> 08:33.535
you might want to do something with
your hands. Like, off the top of my head..

08:33.713 --> 08:35.977
maybe put the CDs
in their right cases.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.208
Here we go.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.752
So you have a big work problem?

08:44.757 --> 08:47.089
Yeah. It's, uh..

08:47.260 --> 08:49.490
Yeah, it's, uh..

08:52.164 --> 08:54.462
You know, it's nothing.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.958
Okay.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.304
So I think I'm gonna take off.

09:03.476 --> 09:08.038
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's..

09:08.214 --> 09:09.806
It's my boss.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.043
-Yeah?
-Yeah. And, uh..

09:14.654 --> 09:16.645
And my baby.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.382
Yeah?

09:19.692 --> 09:22.525
My boss wants to buy my baby.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.698
What? Oh, my God!

09:27.867 --> 09:31.064
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem!

09:31.370 --> 09:35.033
-He wants to buy your baby?
-Can you believe that?

09:35.274 --> 09:38.038
-That's crazy.
-That's what I told him!

09:38.210 --> 09:41.907
-How did this even happen?
-Well, I'll tell you.

09:44.884 --> 09:49.947
See, my boss and his wife,
they can't have children, so..

09:50.122 --> 09:53.558
And then when we were
at the Christmas party..

09:53.726 --> 09:58.322
he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

09:58.598 --> 10:02.932
When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby..

10:03.102 --> 10:05.969
I figured it was
about maternity leave.

10:06.138 --> 10:09.266
Oh. Yeah.

10:19.085 --> 10:23.215
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

10:29.562 --> 10:33.794
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.000
I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

10:36.168 --> 10:40.104
Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

10:40.272 --> 10:43.070
-We've seen each other a lot lately.
-Yes.

10:43.242 --> 10:48.111
Maybe we'll see each other at
dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00?

10:48.280 --> 10:51.249
Well, maybe we will.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.615
Mona?

11:24.784 --> 11:30.120
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

11:30.456 --> 11:31.980
Upstream.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.960
Damn, nobody's here
for my good ones.

11:44.603 --> 11:48.835
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.135
-It's okay.
-No, it's still wet.

11:51.310 --> 11:55.838
Let me get it out before it sets.
I have something you could wear.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.481
Here.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.979
I don't know if I want to wear
a woman's shirt.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.426
-That's a man's shirt.
-Awfully pink.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.459
It's not pink!

12:13.899 --> 12:16.493
Honey, we are so meant
to be together.

12:16.669 --> 12:22.130
-We both have the Annie soundtrack.
-Honey, both yours.

12:23.109 --> 12:26.306
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.811
-The work problem?
-lt was perfect.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.176
It felt like he was my friend.

12:31.350 --> 12:36.287
-What problem did you say you have?
-Oh, that's not important.

12:36.489 --> 12:40.482
The point is,
I think everything's gonna be okay.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.918
May I help you?

12:44.130 --> 12:47.725
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

12:54.373 --> 12:59.470
Isn't it funny how we kept meeting?
It's as if someone wants us together.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.043
Someone does. Me.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.513
Witty banter. Well done. Good.

13:05.684 --> 13:09.882
-Tell me a little bit about yourself.
-Okay. I'm a masseuse.

13:10.055 --> 13:14.754
-And I used to work at this place..
-Do you like to party?

13:16.762 --> 13:18.889
I like parties.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.555
You're wild, aren't you?

13:23.002 --> 13:27.701
-Yeah, I guess. A little.
-Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.371
So anyway..

13:33.846 --> 13:37.839
I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess..

13:38.017 --> 13:41.214
for, well, since I was 14.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.787
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

13:43.989 --> 13:48.050
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

13:48.227 --> 13:51.993
-Oh, stop it.
-And your breasts!

13:55.100 --> 13:56.465
Okay.

13:56.635 --> 13:59.536
Look, you're coming on
a little strong.

13:59.705 --> 14:02.606
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.266
The universe wants us
to be together.

14:05.444 --> 14:09.574
Why don't we start over?
You can tell me about yourself.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.648
-All right.
-Okay.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.781
I write erotic novels..

14:14.954 --> 14:16.512
for children.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.752
-What?
-They're wildly unpopular.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.495
Oh, my God!

14:24.663 --> 14:27.496
Also, you might like to know
I have a Ph.D.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.567
-Wow! You do?
-Yep. A pretty huge..

14:30.736 --> 14:32.135
All right.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.154
-Hey.
-Joey, honey, listen.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.917
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
It meant a lot.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.323
Not a problem.
Just so you know..

14:56.495 --> 15:00.989
that guy won't be bothering
you about that baby thing anymore.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.599
-What?
-Let's just say I took care of it.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.636
Let's say more.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.970
Don't worry. I told him, very nicely:

15:12.144 --> 15:16.012
"You don't go buying people's babies!
So back off!"

15:16.181 --> 15:18.445
-What?
-What?

15:18.617 --> 15:19.845
No, no, no!

15:20.019 --> 15:23.113
He doesn't want to buy my baby!
I made that up!

15:23.289 --> 15:25.519
What? Why?

15:25.791 --> 15:28.851
So we would have something
to talk about!

15:29.028 --> 15:31.792
And you couldn't think
of anything else?

15:31.964 --> 15:35.525
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

15:35.701 --> 15:40.138
You yelled at my boss!
I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?

15:40.306 --> 15:43.139
You could always sell your baby.

15:44.376 --> 15:48.312
I can't believe you brought
my boss into it! I'll be fired!

15:48.480 --> 15:51.415
-You lied to me!
-Well, she told me to!

15:52.885 --> 15:56.048
Chandler has two copies of Annie!

16:35.961 --> 16:37.189
Oh, my God!

16:37.896 --> 16:41.297
-Ross!
-Hello!

16:42.234 --> 16:43.701
What are you doing?

16:43.869 --> 16:49.774
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.601
Okay, then. I'll call you.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.248
Morning. You wanted to see me?

17:07.426 --> 17:10.293
Please, come in. Have a seat.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.590
-Look, Mr. Zelner..
-It's best I speak first.

17:15.768 --> 17:16.996
Yeah.

17:18.804 --> 17:23.798
Lee from Human Resources is here
as a witness to our conversation.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.475
Oh, God.

17:26.445 --> 17:32.645
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby..

17:35.020 --> 17:37.113
I am sorry. Okay?

17:37.289 --> 17:40.850
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was..

17:41.026 --> 17:46.430
I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was "due" your baby.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.799
I want to be very clear..

17:50.969 --> 17:54.302
that I understand
that it's your baby..

17:54.807 --> 17:58.334
and it is not mine to purchase.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.776
Well, as long as we are clear
about that.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.425
There it is.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.862
-Not your regular cleaners.
-I know.

18:22.034 --> 18:25.265
That creep goes there.
I had to find a new one.

18:25.471 --> 18:30.238
I have to find a new bank,
adult bookstore, grocery store..

18:30.576 --> 18:34.706
-What?
-A new grocery store.

18:35.814 --> 18:39.215
The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
I got that?

18:39.384 --> 18:42.217
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

18:42.387 --> 18:46.585
You'll meet someone. If I can meet
a great guy, so can you.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.694
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.097
-You didn't have to come in.
-You kidding?

18:57.302 --> 19:02.239
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

19:02.407 --> 19:06.867
I'm gonna be over here watching
the dance of the clean shirts.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.207
Excuse me.
I think you dropped..

19:14.920 --> 19:16.911
-Wow!
-What?

19:17.089 --> 19:19.717
Sorry.
You're just so incredibly beautiful.

19:19.892 --> 19:24.022
Well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

19:24.196 --> 19:27.632
Don't think I'm crazy,
but I was meant to pick this up.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.735
-Do you believe in that kind of thing?
-A little.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.038
Now you're talking.

19:34.706 --> 19:38.904
-Want to go for coffee?
-I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.

19:39.077 --> 19:42.478
An ink stain!
Can I watch how you get this out?

19:43.782 --> 19:45.773
She must have left.

19:49.888 --> 19:52.914
-So? What happened?
-It's all gonna be okay.

19:53.091 --> 19:58.154
They're so happy I'm not suing, I got
an extra month paid maternity leave.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.561
So long as I understand the money
should not be construed..

20:02.734 --> 20:06.067
as a down payment on this
or any other child.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.068
Ralph Lauren is going
out of their way..

20:09.241 --> 20:12.699
to show they're not
in the baby-buying business.

20:13.111 --> 20:16.706
-Give us a minute?
-Kicking me out of my living room?

20:16.949 --> 20:18.917
Yeah.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.215
I'll be in there.

20:25.924 --> 20:30.122
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things..

20:30.395 --> 20:32.761
I know. I know.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.263
It kind of worked.

20:35.434 --> 20:40.030
I don't know about you,
but I haven't thought about our thing.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.968
Yeah, you're right.

20:42.774 --> 20:46.505
Yeah. It's kind of been
like "us" again, a little bit.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.977
-Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
-Me too.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.709
I haven't thought about
how I put myself out there..

20:53.885 --> 20:57.685
and said that stuff.
How you didn't feel the same..

20:57.856 --> 21:01.849
and how it was really awkward.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.564
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

21:18.543 --> 21:22.377
Item J437-A.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.539
Color: winterberry.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.721
Hi, listen.
Come here. Come..

21:35.894 --> 21:39.421
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

21:39.598 --> 21:43.034
But what did I tell you about leaving
your key outside the door like that?

21:43.201 --> 21:45.761
I mean, you're lucky it was me
and not someone else.

21:47.272 --> 21:50.036
I guess lucky is too strong a word.

21:50.942 --> 21:54.002
Anyway, Mona, I'm really, really sorry.
It's just..

21:54.179 --> 21:59.048
Listen, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.515
-You do?
-Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

22:02.754 --> 22:06.485
To be honest,
I still have feelings for you.

22:06.725 --> 22:09.489
I wish we could work it out,
but we can't.

22:09.661 --> 22:14.826
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just..

22:15.000 --> 22:18.094
It just wasn't meant to be.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.401
Oh, God. You're right.

22:21.907 --> 22:25.843
Ross, we have to be strong.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.279
Okay, I'm gonna go.

22:32.718 --> 22:36.085
Can I? To remember you?

22:40.292 --> 22:42.055
No.
