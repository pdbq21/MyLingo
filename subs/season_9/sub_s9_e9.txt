WEBVTT

00:03.439 --> 00:06.776
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

00:06.947 --> 00:09.851
And this little guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

00:12.457 --> 00:15.361
That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

00:15.531 --> 00:16.658
Single, are you?

00:24.148 --> 00:26.015
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

00:26.285 --> 00:27.310
Chandler Bing.

00:27.487 --> 00:31.120
How come you're answering your own
phone? Where's your crazy assistant?

00:33.032 --> 00:34.626
You're not crazy. You're not crazy.

00:34.803 --> 00:37.639
Otherwise, why would you
have all those cats?

00:38.677 --> 00:39.702
What's up, Joe?

00:39.913 --> 00:42.042
What have we always wanted
to do together?

00:42.852 --> 00:45.881
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

00:46.058 --> 00:48.460
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night..

00:48.664 --> 00:52.034
you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

00:52.237 --> 00:53.706
- Courtside? Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

00:53.907 --> 00:57.711
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for
the ball and break my jaw with his knee!

00:57.949 --> 01:00.215
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

01:03.827 --> 01:05.056
These need your signature.

01:05.230 --> 01:08.396
Listen, Jo Lynn, that was my friend Joey.
He calls everybody crazy.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.129
- Hello?
- Hey, hon, it's me.

01:10.306 --> 01:13.837
Hi. How's the crazy cat lady?

01:16.085 --> 01:17.110
Joey just called.

01:17.287 --> 01:20.054
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

01:20.226 --> 01:23.597
But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.

01:23.767 --> 01:26.363
If you go, we won't have
a night together for a week.

01:26.540 --> 01:30.776
But honey, it's courtside!
The cheerleaders will be right in..

01:31.415 --> 01:33.852
That's not the way to convince you.

01:34.021 --> 01:36.184
I don't wanna be one
of those wives that says:

01:36.358 --> 01:39.262
"You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me."

01:39.431 --> 01:41.800
So if you could just realize it
on your own..

01:42.905 --> 01:46.036
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

01:46.212 --> 01:49.378
I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's looking forward to it.

01:49.552 --> 01:52.045
Tell him you haven't seen
your wife in a long time.

01:52.257 --> 01:56.095
Tell him that having a long-distance
relationship is really difficult.

01:56.265 --> 02:00.399
Tell him that what little time
we have together is precious.

02:01.776 --> 02:03.244
I'll think of something.

02:58.924 --> 03:01.486
You look..

03:02.631 --> 03:06.833
I mean, it's just..
That dress..

03:07.273 --> 03:09.972
Well, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

03:10.146 --> 03:13.346
They're good. It's just been a while
since I've seen you like this.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.513
You clean up good.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.785
Really? Well, thank you.

03:23.005 --> 03:24.872
Okay, stop looking at me like that.

03:25.076 --> 03:27.980
- Last time that happened, that happened.
- Right, right.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.431
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

03:37.601 --> 03:40.094
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and l
are gonna have so much fun.

03:40.306 --> 03:43.210
- Thank you for watching the baby.
- It's fine.

03:43.379 --> 03:45.509
Actually, I invited Mike over.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.709
- Phoebe's Mike?
- Yeah.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.013
- I didn't know you hung out.
- We don't..

03:49.224 --> 03:51.023
but I'd like to get to know him.

03:51.195 --> 03:54.133
Maybe have a little dinner,
drinks, conversation.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.066
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

03:58.543 --> 04:00.375
It's not a date.

04:00.547 --> 04:02.779
But if it turns out to be
something more..

04:02.952 --> 04:04.854
I'll leave a tie on the door.

04:05.858 --> 04:08.488
Will that be awkward?
What are you gonna talk about?

04:08.697 --> 04:11.999
I don't know. But you know, we have
a lot in common, you know?

04:12.170 --> 04:15.199
He plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.

04:16.946 --> 04:20.545
He's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.922
- Yeah?
- Hi!

04:27.801 --> 04:30.773
Girl's night out indeed.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.411
So I think Emma is probably
down for the night..

04:33.580 --> 04:35.777
- but if you need anything..
- We'll be fine.

04:35.951 --> 04:37.887
- You go have fun.
- Okay, you too.

04:38.055 --> 04:40.423
- Thanks.
- And I hope you score.

04:40.761 --> 04:43.163
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

04:43.332 --> 04:45.929
So, welcome.

04:46.506 --> 04:49.910
- I got beer.
- I got bottled breast milk.

04:51.950 --> 04:54.751
- Why don't we start with the beer.
- Okay.

04:57.995 --> 05:02.664
- So Phoebe tells me you play piano.
- Yeah.

05:02.838 --> 05:05.639
You know, I used to play keyboards
in college.

05:06.144 --> 05:07.511
Do you have one here?

05:09.150 --> 05:10.744
No.

05:11.656 --> 05:13.853
Okay.

05:30.861 --> 05:34.596
You know, I'm divorced.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.000
Phoebe.. Phoebe says you're..
You've been divorced?

05:38.175 --> 05:40.372
Yeah, yeah.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.449
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really like
to talk about it.

05:46.859 --> 05:50.389
That's okay. We'll talk about
something else.

05:56.278 --> 05:58.214
- This is a nice apartment.
- Thanks.

05:58.382 --> 06:01.981
The moldings are all original.

06:05.597 --> 06:09.628
I don't know if the moldings
are original in my apartment.

06:19.725 --> 06:22.195
- So you're a paleontologist, right?
- Yeah.

06:22.363 --> 06:24.356
My cousin's a paleontologist.

06:29.144 --> 06:33.209
Well, he and I would probably have
a lot to talk about.

06:38.596 --> 06:40.964
- Welcome home.
- Well, look at you.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.797
Yeah. What do you think?

06:43.238 --> 06:45.231
Well, it looks great. It's just..

06:45.409 --> 06:48.678
I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so..

06:49.083 --> 06:51.383
You see what I mean?

06:52.524 --> 06:55.985
Hey! How come your door's locked?

06:56.164 --> 06:58.134
- Just a second!
- No, no, no!

06:58.302 --> 06:59.965
- Joey can't know I'm here.
- Why not?

07:00.139 --> 07:02.542
I didn't want to say
I couldn't go to the game..

07:02.711 --> 07:05.945
- so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
- So you lied to him?

07:06.151 --> 07:09.955
It's always better to lie than to have
the complicated discussion.

07:11.629 --> 07:13.291
Except with you.

07:14.702 --> 07:18.300
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

07:21.949 --> 07:23.417
- What are you..?
- Hi.

07:23.586 --> 07:26.216
Why are you dressed like that?

07:27.059 --> 07:29.929
Because Chandler's gonna be home
in a couple of days..

07:30.099 --> 07:33.971
so I thought I would just, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

07:34.274 --> 07:36.267
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

07:36.478 --> 07:39.211
No, I was just doing Chandler's side
of the conversation.

07:39.384 --> 07:41.719
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

07:41.889 --> 07:46.193
"Really sexy. Could I be any more
turned on?" You know?

07:46.766 --> 07:48.462
Okay. Wait a minute.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.606
Why are there two glasses
of wine out?

07:51.141 --> 07:53.134
Because one of them is for you!

07:57.654 --> 08:00.558
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

08:02.229 --> 08:07.035
You know, it's funny. I've been
practicing the art of seduction myself.

08:09.845 --> 08:11.838
- You might wanna keep practicing.
- Yeah.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.790
- It's Joey.
- What?

08:16.959 --> 08:19.954
- Hey, Joe.
- Dude, come home!

08:21.569 --> 08:25.201
- What? Why?
- Come home!

08:25.442 --> 08:27.275
Look, I can't. What's going on?

08:27.480 --> 08:31.284
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I think Monica's cheating on you!

08:31.454 --> 08:34.392
I told you, you shouldn't have married
someone hotter than you!

08:37.667 --> 08:39.967
If you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.

08:40.172 --> 08:42.507
- No!
- I just heard him!

08:43.880 --> 08:46.407
Can you hear him now?

08:48.756 --> 08:50.988
No. All right, I'm going in.

08:51.194 --> 08:52.754
- No, wait!
- I heard him again!

08:56.271 --> 08:58.538
All right, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

08:58.743 --> 09:00.234
I'll see you when you get here.

09:00.412 --> 09:02.679
I'll wait out in the hall
in case he comes out.

09:03.385 --> 09:06.357
- Is that really necessary?
- Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

09:06.525 --> 09:11.159
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

09:12.904 --> 09:15.170
- Yeah, listen, thanks a lot.
- Okay, bye.

09:15.910 --> 09:17.903
He thinks I'm a slut.

09:18.081 --> 09:21.281
Oh, right, and you're
supposed to be a fireman?

09:33.378 --> 09:35.713
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

09:35.884 --> 09:41.522
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?

09:42.697 --> 09:45.065
Eleven minutes.

09:51.114 --> 09:53.608
And now 12.

09:56.959 --> 10:00.660
- So you wanna watch TV?
- You think I haven't thought of that?

10:01.467 --> 10:04.303
I mean, I would like to
but the cable's out.

10:05.008 --> 10:08.914
Didn't seem like such a big deal
until tonight.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.191
- So you like the beer?
- I do. I do.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.138
Although, it's actually a lager.

10:25.182 --> 10:27.277
What's the difference
between beer and lager?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.047
I don't know.

10:31.729 --> 10:32.958
We could look it up.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.204
Things are about to get wild.

10:43.619 --> 10:46.146
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights
we used to have..

10:46.324 --> 10:48.453
sitting around talking
about you and Ross?

10:48.629 --> 10:51.065
Oh, God! It seems like forever ago.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.259
I know.

10:53.639 --> 10:56.075
So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

10:56.845 --> 11:01.913
Well, I don't know. I mean,
for a long time, nothing.

11:02.089 --> 11:05.859
But you know, actually,
right before you picked me up..

11:06.030 --> 11:08.593
Ross and I had a little thing.

11:08.803 --> 11:11.775
Oh, my God! I love things!
What happened?

11:11.975 --> 11:15.277
Well, first he told me
he liked how I looked.

11:15.449 --> 11:19.321
And then we had a little..

11:20.459 --> 11:22.692
eye contact.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.328
Eye contact?

11:25.536 --> 11:27.300
I hope you were using protection.

11:29.210 --> 11:34.984
Excuse me, these are from
the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

11:36.324 --> 11:39.786
Oh, actually, I can't have another one
on account of my breast milk.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.462
Okay.

11:43.071 --> 11:47.409
Hey, Rach, maybe there's a less
disgusting way to decline a drink.

11:49.450 --> 11:53.049
Should we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!

11:53.258 --> 11:54.591
No, wait! Don't do that!

11:54.761 --> 11:56.754
That'll make them think
they can come over.

11:56.965 --> 11:58.263
So, what if they do?

11:58.468 --> 12:03.912
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

12:04.681 --> 12:08.644
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

12:08.823 --> 12:12.888
You know, not everything has to go
as far as eye contact.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.532
Chandler, you have to tell Joey
you're not in Tulsa.

12:17.774 --> 12:20.472
Isn't it better for him
to think you're cheating on me..

12:20.646 --> 12:23.481
than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

12:23.686 --> 12:25.484
I heard it.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.460
I don't want him to think
I'm having an affair.

12:29.196 --> 12:31.929
All right, I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape..

12:32.135 --> 12:35.301
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."

12:35.510 --> 12:36.876
Hear me out, woman!

12:38.682 --> 12:40.743
I'll go down the fire escape and wait.

12:40.987 --> 12:43.480
Then it'll be like I just got back
from Tulsa.

12:43.659 --> 12:46.654
Joey and I will come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

12:46.865 --> 12:50.269
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure all this out?

12:53.546 --> 12:55.071
I heard it.

13:02.931 --> 13:04.992
- I'm gonna wait.
- The scary pigeon's back?

13:05.201 --> 13:07.262
It's huge.

13:40.673 --> 13:44.545
I can't believe you live in that building.
My grandmother lives in that building!

13:44.714 --> 13:47.150
Ida Greene? No sense
of personal space..

13:47.319 --> 13:49.813
kind of smells like chicken,
looks like a potato.

13:50.025 --> 13:52.724
- "Spuds" is your grandmother?
- That's my bubbe!

13:56.037 --> 13:59.009
So we're on our way
to a couple of parties.

13:59.176 --> 14:02.478
Maybe we could get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?

14:03.251 --> 14:06.520
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really
looking for anything to happen..

14:06.692 --> 14:09.219
with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

14:09.531 --> 14:11.558
- All right.
- It's no big deal.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.873
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you was for me?

14:16.645 --> 14:19.549
- That would've been me.
- Nice.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.555
Different situation, cowboy,
and you would've had yourself a handful.

14:28.301 --> 14:32.800
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

14:33.244 --> 14:36.775
Well, it's complicated.
I don't actually have a boyfriend, but..

14:36.985 --> 14:39.478
Then can I have your number?

14:40.125 --> 14:41.822
I'm sorry, no.

14:42.295 --> 14:43.388
Okay.

14:43.899 --> 14:46.165
Oh, sure!

14:47.607 --> 14:50.841
Oh, my God, you're giving
your real number!

14:52.517 --> 14:54.987
Okay, thanks. I'll give you
a call later tonight.

14:55.188 --> 14:57.055
- Great.
- Bye.

14:57.225 --> 14:58.488
Bye.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.162
So that's great.

15:02.335 --> 15:06.036
You, Bill, Ross and Emma are
gonna be so happy together.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.645
What were you thinking?

15:07.847 --> 15:11.251
I don't know. He was cute,
and he liked me. It was an impulse.

15:11.755 --> 15:15.525
Like when I bought these shoes.
They were cute and they liked me too.

15:16.063 --> 15:18.295
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

15:19.403 --> 15:21.373
We had a moment.
We looked at each other.

15:21.541 --> 15:25.641
Maybe if we live together
for another 10 years, we may hold hands!

15:26.483 --> 15:28.545
But you were really excited about it.

15:28.722 --> 15:30.749
- Don't you wanna talk to him?
- No.

15:30.926 --> 15:34.057
No, because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.262
"Hey, Ross, you know, I think
we had a moment before."

15:37.439 --> 15:40.742
"Yeah. Me too."

15:40.913 --> 15:44.283
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want
to do anything about it."

15:44.453 --> 15:47.620
"Yeah. Me neither."

15:47.793 --> 15:49.455
"Should we just live together..

15:49.631 --> 15:51.794
and not tell each other
how we're feeling?"

15:51.968 --> 15:54.906
"Yeah, that works for me."

15:56.645 --> 15:58.581
Yeah, I see what you mean.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.017
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

16:02.188 --> 16:03.748
Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

16:03.959 --> 16:05.427
- Well.. Hey!
- Better.

16:08.034 --> 16:12.031
The point is maybe I should just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.408
You know? I should just
move on with my life.

16:15.649 --> 16:18.519
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

16:18.689 --> 16:21.023
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

16:21.193 --> 16:24.165
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.328
Ross will pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.

16:27.540 --> 16:29.236
Oh, my God, Ross!

16:29.443 --> 16:31.539
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

16:31.715 --> 16:34.744
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!

16:34.988 --> 16:38.483
"Oh, I have to get my number back!
Oh, my God! He's gone!" Dead on.

16:52.422 --> 16:55.793
- You know, I'm gonna take off.
- So soon?

16:55.963 --> 16:57.329
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:57.499 --> 17:00.027
Well, thanks.. Thanks for the beer.

17:00.204 --> 17:03.871
- You mean lager?
- Yeah. Good times.

17:08.755 --> 17:11.419
- Okay.
- All right.

17:25.388 --> 17:27.621
- Hello?
- Hey, Mike, it's me.

17:27.793 --> 17:29.729
Listen, is.. Is Ross near you?

17:29.931 --> 17:31.456
No, I just left.

17:31.935 --> 17:35.705
And that, right there, is the most interesting
conversation I've had all night.

17:36.778 --> 17:37.905
Really? Okay.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.845
Well, you have to go back in.

17:40.652 --> 17:45.252
What? Go back? To the land
where time stands still?

17:45.996 --> 17:47.590
I'm so sorry, honey, but..

17:47.766 --> 17:49.759
Okay, Rachel gave this guy
her number..

17:49.971 --> 17:52.271
and she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

17:52.475 --> 17:54.468
So you have to intercept all his calls.

17:55.047 --> 17:56.174
I can't do that!

17:56.383 --> 17:59.378
- He says he can't do that.
- Give me the phone.

17:59.557 --> 18:03.223
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this
is a lot to ask, but you know what?

18:03.397 --> 18:08.773
If you do this, Phoebe will do
anything you want.

18:08.942 --> 18:13.144
- Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
- All right. Thank you. Hello?

18:13.317 --> 18:17.223
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

18:19.262 --> 18:20.788
All right, I'll do it.

18:21.768 --> 18:25.674
But really, how much dirtier
can it get?

18:26.978 --> 18:29.414
Oh, Mike.

18:30.051 --> 18:32.317
Bye.

18:36.296 --> 18:38.095
Hey, buddy.

18:40.672 --> 18:42.197
Hi.

18:42.576 --> 18:45.376
- Can I come back in?
- Why?

18:46.818 --> 18:52.455
Well, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.

18:52.997 --> 18:55.992
But you left.

19:00.512 --> 19:02.140
That didn't take long.

19:02.348 --> 19:05.913
I thought you said Tulsa was,
like, a three-hour flight?

19:06.758 --> 19:10.492
Well, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

19:18.882 --> 19:21.513
- You ready? I'm gonna go in there with you.
- Thanks.

19:21.688 --> 19:24.181
Just in case there's more
than one dude in there.

19:25.862 --> 19:27.296
- Again, thanks.
- Yeah.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.703
Chandler, you're home!

19:30.872 --> 19:35.507
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!

19:42.195 --> 19:44.097
You know what I mean.

19:45.468 --> 19:46.596
What are you saying?

19:46.838 --> 19:48.671
Joey said you're here
with another man!

19:48.875 --> 19:52.610
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!

19:55.722 --> 20:01.324
All right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a look around.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.507
He can't even see us!

20:07.679 --> 20:10.013
- I kind of liked it.
- Me too.

20:13.123 --> 20:14.182
What's he doing?

20:14.392 --> 20:17.923
I arranged some pillows on the bed
to look like a guy.

20:19.703 --> 20:24.406
Bedroom's clear. Although you might
need some new pillows.

20:24.713 --> 20:27.742
All right, well, I'll check
the guest room.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.632
Why do I smell men's cologne?

20:39.844 --> 20:42.041
I think that's you.

20:44.553 --> 20:48.618
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myself earlier.

20:49.763 --> 20:51.425
There's nobody here, Joe.

20:52.201 --> 20:53.260
I guess not.

20:53.638 --> 20:58.079
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You owe me an apology.

20:58.515 --> 21:01.179
- You're right. I'm so sorry.
- It's an honest mistake.

21:01.353 --> 21:03.482
It could happen to anybody. See you.

21:03.658 --> 21:06.060
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

21:06.229 --> 21:10.397
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

21:14.112 --> 21:17.482
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?

21:21.561 --> 21:24.361
So, with the exception
of the fermentation process..

21:24.533 --> 21:27.937
beer and ale are
basically the same thing.

21:28.908 --> 21:31.539
Fascinating, isn't it?

21:31.714 --> 21:35.175
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

21:36.423 --> 21:38.393
I'll get it!

21:43.470 --> 21:47.467
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

21:49.382 --> 21:50.783
It's for you.

21:54.793 --> 21:58.061
I don't understand
what just happened here.

22:00.437 --> 22:02.134
What's going on?

22:02.308 --> 22:03.435
I'm sorry.

22:03.611 --> 22:07.745
I told you I was in Tulsa because I
wanted to spend the night with Monica..

22:07.919 --> 22:11.757
and I didn't know..
I didn't think you'd understand.

22:12.829 --> 22:16.633
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife?

22:16.804 --> 22:19.935
You think I'm, like..

22:22.348 --> 22:25.047
- Joey?
- Yeah.

22:25.454 --> 22:28.621
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.

22:28.795 --> 22:32.063
I feel so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

22:34.540 --> 22:37.910
You could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.545
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

22:42.823 --> 22:46.661
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't do.
I promised I'd be with Monica.

22:47.298 --> 22:48.562
All right.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.100
- You can go.
- What?

22:51.306 --> 22:54.107
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.244
- Really? You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

22:57.586 --> 23:01.252
You know, maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.

23:01.527 --> 23:06.059
- You're gonna put sweats on and clean.
- It's gonna be so hot!

23:06.469 --> 23:07.699
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:07.873 --> 23:09.034
Thanks.

23:09.943 --> 23:11.377
Here's your ticket.

23:11.547 --> 23:13.744
Thanks. Hey, listen..

23:13.918 --> 23:16.549
I'm never gonna lie
to you again, okay?

23:16.757 --> 23:19.991
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.

23:20.665 --> 23:21.894
Thanks, man.

23:25.174 --> 23:28.511
- Where you going?
- Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

23:40.437 --> 23:43.034
I'm glad I got to talk to your mom.
She sounds nice.

23:43.210 --> 23:45.545
Yeah, she's a peach.

23:48.921 --> 23:50.355
Oh, God!

23:50.525 --> 23:53.394
So glad you're back!

23:54.533 --> 23:56.126
So, what did you guys do?

23:56.369 --> 23:59.136
You know, we just drank some beer.

23:59.308 --> 24:02.041
Mike played with the boundaries
of normal social conduct.

24:03.283 --> 24:06.119
It's true, I did.

24:07.024 --> 24:08.049
- Well, goodbye.
- Okay.

24:08.260 --> 24:10.823
- Bye. That was fun, Phoebe.
- I know. It was fun.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.797
See you, guys.

24:12.969 --> 24:15.166
Lock the door!
Lock the door, seriously.

24:16.844 --> 24:19.543
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.

24:21.587 --> 24:24.957
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?

24:25.127 --> 24:26.619
No, just his mom.

24:26.864 --> 24:28.093
Around 8:30?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.860
- Yeah.
- Then again at 9:00?

24:30.370 --> 24:32.306
Yeah.

24:37.752 --> 24:39.847
Hello?

24:40.190 --> 24:43.527
No, she's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

24:44.365 --> 24:47.269
Bill from the bar?

24:48.541 --> 24:53.950
Okay, Bill from the bar,
I'll make sure she gets your number.

25:05.107 --> 25:07.441
So.. So how was it?

25:07.612 --> 25:09.741
Did you guys..?
You guys have a good time?

25:09.916 --> 25:14.414
We had so much fun.
It felt so good to be out.

25:17.231 --> 25:18.825
Rach?

25:19.001 --> 25:21.096
Yeah?

25:23.911 --> 25:25.072
Never mind.

25:32.494 --> 25:35.125
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey!

25:35.300 --> 25:38.831
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.873
Stout. That's a kind of beer.
