WEBVTT

00:04.890 --> 00:07.256
You have got to try this cheesecake.

00:07.492 --> 00:10.222
You know, I'm not that much
of a sweet tooth--

00:11.563 --> 00:13.758
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

00:14.299 --> 00:17.132
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!

00:17.402 --> 00:19.063
Where did you get this?

00:19.738 --> 00:23.572
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.

00:24.609 --> 00:26.304
This isn't addressed to you.

00:26.578 --> 00:29.809
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

00:30.048 --> 00:31.572
Thief!

00:32.517 --> 00:34.883
I didn't read the bo<i>x</i>
before I opened it...

00:35.120 --> 00:37.748
...and you can't return a bo<i>x</i>
after you opened it!

00:37.956 --> 00:41.084
-Why not?
-Because it's too deIicious!

00:42.828 --> 00:45.319
You stoIe this cheesecake.
That's wrong.

00:45.597 --> 00:50.159
No, it'II be okay because Mrs. Braverman
wiII send for a free one.

00:50.402 --> 00:52.131
That way, we aII win.

00:52.337 --> 00:56.296
The onIy Iosers are the
big cheesecake congIomerate...

00:56.608 --> 00:59.042
...''Mama's LittIe Bakery.''

01:00.045 --> 01:01.637
I feeI terribIe.

01:01.913 --> 01:04.347
I'm a horribIe, horribIe person.

01:05.684 --> 01:07.345
I'm sorry, what?

01:09.054 --> 01:11.284
The One With AII The Cheesecakes

01:47.058 --> 01:49.549
I shouId get going. Big day at work.

01:49.828 --> 01:51.853
You know how I'm in a coma?

01:52.430 --> 01:56.127
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

01:57.002 --> 01:58.128
So--

01:58.336 --> 01:59.928
Mr. Smarty Pants.

02:00.138 --> 02:02.538
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

02:03.608 --> 02:05.439
Pheebs, stiII on for tonight?

02:05.677 --> 02:07.941
-AbsoIuteIy.
-I'II see you at 8.

02:08.146 --> 02:09.738
What's at 8?

02:09.981 --> 02:14.850
Dinner. We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you.

02:16.488 --> 02:18.285
Wow! Did not know that.

02:18.523 --> 02:21.048
May I say how IoveIy you Iook today?

02:21.293 --> 02:22.317
DuIy noted.

02:23.628 --> 02:27.894
So for tomorrow, do you want to
rent a car and drive down together?

02:28.200 --> 02:31.692
-What are you taIking about?
-Cousin Frannie's wedding.

02:32.504 --> 02:35.132
You were invited?

02:36.274 --> 02:37.832
No.

02:38.043 --> 02:40.341
Oh, my God, I can't beIieve this.

02:40.579 --> 02:42.979
I thought onIy Mom and Dad
were invited.

02:43.215 --> 02:47.345
From the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparabIe.

02:47.586 --> 02:51.386
Maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

02:53.692 --> 02:55.626
Do you wanna make some new friends?

02:57.662 --> 03:00.825
It's probabIy just a mistake.
Let me caII Aunt CheryI.

03:00.999 --> 03:04.366
Maybe you are invited and the
invitation got Iost in the maiI.

03:04.569 --> 03:07.629
You caII her and teII her
that when we were kids...

03:07.839 --> 03:11.138
...her precious Frannie
tried to undress me severaI times.

03:11.376 --> 03:14.971
If I hadn't stopped her, there
wouIdn't be a wedding to go to.

03:15.213 --> 03:17.943
She tried to undress me too.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.245
I used to undress my cousin GIenn.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.519
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

03:32.864 --> 03:34.855
I think he's stiII out.
What's wrong?

03:35.100 --> 03:37.466
I'II teII you, RacheI Karen Greene.

03:37.702 --> 03:40.694
I had pIans with Joey,
and he Ieft me this note.

03:41.006 --> 03:44.407
''Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. TaIk to you Iater.

03:44.609 --> 03:46.270
Big Daddy.''

03:47.279 --> 03:50.271
-''Big Daddy''?
-That's a nickname we were trying.

03:50.482 --> 03:53.315
Why didn't you guys try ''Francis''?

03:54.419 --> 03:57.320
Francis is a cooIer name than ChandIer,
isn't it?

03:58.123 --> 04:02.423
You know what nickname
never caught on? ''The Ross-a-tron.''

04:07.065 --> 04:09.090
Here's Joseph Francis!

04:09.334 --> 04:12.565
Wait, what are you
middIe-naming me for?

04:12.771 --> 04:14.238
I Ieft you a note.

04:14.439 --> 04:16.771
That doesn't give you the
right to ditch me!

04:17.042 --> 04:20.944
You can canceI pIans with friends
if there's a possibiIity for se<i>x</i>.

04:21.179 --> 04:23.340
He's right. That is the ruIe.

04:23.515 --> 04:25.278
-ReaIIy?
-WeII, that's what I hear.

04:25.450 --> 04:28.248
I've never gotten a chance
to actuaIIy empIoy the ruIe.

04:29.921 --> 04:33.948
I don't accept it. When we make
pIans, I e<i>x</i>pect you to show up.

04:34.125 --> 04:37.356
I'm not a way to kiII time
tiII you meet someone better.

04:37.595 --> 04:42.225
Boyfriends and girIfriends wiII
come and go, but this is for Iife.

04:42.534 --> 04:46.527
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it wouId bother you this much.

04:46.771 --> 04:48.102
WeII, it does.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.467
WeII, can I make it up to you?

04:50.742 --> 04:51.970
I'm sorry.

04:52.243 --> 04:56.145
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'II pay for myseIf.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.414
Okay, you wore me down.

05:02.287 --> 05:06.451
WhiIe you're over there, how
about a beer for ''The Ross-a-tron''?

05:07.726 --> 05:09.660
''Ross--'' Is that back?

05:20.171 --> 05:22.002
The other cheesecake came.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.640
They deIivered it here again.

05:25.543 --> 05:28.341
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the probIem?

05:28.546 --> 05:30.537
I can't seem to say goodbye.

05:30.782 --> 05:32.079
Are you serious?

05:32.283 --> 05:35.548
We ate an entire cake
two days ago and you want more?

05:35.787 --> 05:38.415
WeII, I've forgotten
what it tastes Iike.

05:38.690 --> 05:41.557
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

05:41.793 --> 05:45.661
It had a buttery, crumbIy,
graham cracker crust...

05:45.864 --> 05:48.697
...with a very rich...

05:48.933 --> 05:52.869
...yet Iight cream cheese fiIIing.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.540
Wow, my whoIe mouth
just fiIIed with saIiva.

05:58.476 --> 06:01.172
Know what? Forget it.
We're just hungry.

06:01.379 --> 06:03.870
We haven't had Iunch.
We're just Iightheaded.

06:04.115 --> 06:07.607
So Iet's go have Iunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

06:07.886 --> 06:10.252
We'II drop it off
so we're not tempted.

06:10.455 --> 06:13.720
-Where do you want to eat?
-Mama's LittIe Bakery, Chicago.

06:18.897 --> 06:21.422
MeI Tormé died.

06:21.699 --> 06:24.259
Joey, that paper's Iike a year oId.

06:24.469 --> 06:27.961
Does that mean the Sam Goody's saIe
is over?

06:31.276 --> 06:34.074
So I finaIIy heard back
from Aunt CheryI...

06:34.312 --> 06:36.837
...and apparentIy it wasn't a mistake.

06:37.115 --> 06:38.844
There's Iimited seating--

06:39.117 --> 06:43.816
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!

06:44.656 --> 06:46.647
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

06:46.925 --> 06:49.450
I mean, the Iast time she saw you...

06:49.727 --> 06:53.754
...you'd have turned one of those
IittIe wedding chairs into kindIing.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.262
''Limited seating.''
That's such a Iame e<i>x</i>cuse.

06:58.470 --> 07:01.030
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.

07:01.306 --> 07:05.106
What's the big deaI? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

07:05.343 --> 07:09.746
If it makes you feeI any better, Joan
and I wiII just make an appearance...

07:09.981 --> 07:13.280
...and then we'II Ieave earIy
as a sign of protest.

07:13.485 --> 07:15.851
-Joan?
-Yeah, my date.

07:16.054 --> 07:20.115
Assistant professor in Iinguistics.
TaII, very beautifuI.

07:20.358 --> 07:24.692
And despite what some peopIe say,
not broad-backed.

07:25.697 --> 07:28.894
Wait a minute.
You got ''Ross GeIIer and Guest''?

07:29.167 --> 07:31.362
I wasn't invited,
and you got ''and Guest''?

07:31.569 --> 07:34.697
E<i>x</i>cuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behaIf.

07:34.973 --> 07:36.873
I think the ruIe appIies here.

07:37.075 --> 07:39.305
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back--

07:39.544 --> 07:40.841
Not broad-back!

07:42.046 --> 07:45.607
Dude, I've seen her. She's Iike a biIIboard.

07:47.218 --> 07:49.686
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

07:49.921 --> 07:51.479
I can't canceI on Joan.

07:51.723 --> 07:53.714
-Why not?
-Did you not hear me?

07:53.925 --> 07:57.759
She's an assistant professor
in the Iinguistics department.

07:58.029 --> 07:59.997
They're wiId.

08:00.665 --> 08:03.930
-Why do you want to come anyway?
-Because...

08:04.102 --> 08:05.626
...she's my cousin.

08:05.904 --> 08:08.668
I mean, we grew up together.

08:08.940 --> 08:12.740
FamiIy, you know?
And aII that's important to me.

08:13.411 --> 08:15.936
Okay, aII right. I'II take you.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.909
I'II go caII Joan.

08:19.117 --> 08:20.744
Oh, that's nice.

08:20.952 --> 08:22.749
FamiIy shouId be there.

08:22.987 --> 08:25.148
It's her wedding.
Happiest day of her Iife.

08:25.423 --> 08:27.084
We'II see.

08:32.063 --> 08:33.963
WeII, thank you for Iunch.

08:34.198 --> 08:36.166
Wait, I thought you paid.

08:36.367 --> 08:39.097
ApparentIy, we don't pay
for food anymore.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.701
-Do you see what I see?
-It's stiII there.

08:45.777 --> 08:48.075
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

08:51.883 --> 08:54.852
She couId be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.

08:55.119 --> 08:58.680
By then, it may spoiI.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.

08:58.890 --> 09:00.824
-It couId kiII her.
-Don't want that.

09:01.092 --> 09:02.218
We're protecting her.

09:02.460 --> 09:03.688
-We'II take it.
-But <i>q</i>uick.

09:03.962 --> 09:05.827
-Why?
-I hear her in there.

09:06.097 --> 09:08.463
Go! Go! Go!

09:11.469 --> 09:15.337
Do you think it's inappropriate to wear
a white, Iacy dress to a wedding?

09:15.506 --> 09:17.974
-Yes.
-E<i>x</i>ceIIent.

09:21.646 --> 09:23.477
Oh, my God, that's David.

09:23.748 --> 09:25.648
-Who?
-David, the scientist guy.

09:25.883 --> 09:27.851
David that I was in Iove with.

09:28.052 --> 09:30.612
Who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

09:30.822 --> 09:31.880
Oh, my God!

09:32.156 --> 09:34.454
Say their name enough,
they turn around.

09:36.628 --> 09:37.856
Phoebe.

09:38.129 --> 09:40.063
David.

09:42.634 --> 09:45.694
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

09:45.970 --> 09:48.700
I'm just in town for a conference.

09:48.906 --> 09:51.500
God, you Iook phenomenaI.

09:51.776 --> 09:53.175
WeII....

09:53.378 --> 09:54.640
Yeah.

09:55.313 --> 09:58.214
You Iook great too.
Did you get a haircut?

09:58.483 --> 10:01.008
Yeah. WeII, I got Iike 30 of them.

10:02.787 --> 10:04.982
Look, I got a confession to make.

10:05.223 --> 10:07.487
I was hoping to run into you here.

10:07.692 --> 10:11.492
I didn't know if I shouId caII.
I was onIy in town a few days...

10:11.696 --> 10:14.164
...and I didn't want to intrude
on your Iife.

10:14.365 --> 10:16.230
I reaIIy wanted to see you...

10:16.501 --> 10:19.402
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

10:20.238 --> 10:24.732
Of course I wouId want to see you.
I think about you aII the time.

10:24.942 --> 10:27.911
ReaIIy? Because I think about you
aII the time.

10:28.179 --> 10:32.206
There's a statue in Minsk
that reminds me of you so much.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.680
It's actuaIIy of Lenin...

10:34.886 --> 10:38.117
...but, you know, at certain angIes....

10:38.923 --> 10:41.551
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

10:41.826 --> 10:43.123
Yes.

10:43.428 --> 10:45.055
Oh, no!

10:46.030 --> 10:47.554
-What?
-I can't.

10:47.832 --> 10:51.063
I can't beIieve I have pIans.
Can you do it tomorrow?

10:51.269 --> 10:55.865
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.768
Listen, ne<i>x</i>t time you're in Minsk....

10:59.110 --> 11:02.341
Phoebe? Can I taIk to you
for a second?

11:02.580 --> 11:04.047
What are you doing?

11:04.282 --> 11:05.749
I have pIans with Joey.

11:05.983 --> 11:07.541
So? He'II understand.

11:07.752 --> 11:10.448
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

11:10.655 --> 11:15.786
I made a whoIe speech about how
you do not canceI pIans with friends.

11:16.561 --> 11:19.758
And now just because, potentiaIIy,
the Iove of my Iife...

11:19.997 --> 11:22.261
...returns from Russia
for one night...

11:22.500 --> 11:25.298
...I shouId change my beIiefs?

11:25.570 --> 11:27.595
I shouId change my beIiefs!

11:28.172 --> 11:32.768
No. If I don't have my principIes,
I don't have anything.

11:32.977 --> 11:34.137
You're so strong.

11:34.412 --> 11:38.405
Or I shouId rush through dinner
with Joey and meet David at 9.

11:42.553 --> 11:44.783
Oh, my God, that is so good!

11:45.056 --> 11:48.492
I'm fuII. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

11:48.760 --> 11:50.352
...I'II regret it.

11:52.163 --> 11:54.131
Hey, what have you got there?

11:54.398 --> 11:55.763
Oh, it's....

11:56.000 --> 11:58.264
It's tofu cake. Want some?

12:02.473 --> 12:04.304
What are you doing tonight?

12:04.675 --> 12:06.802
Dude. Dude.

12:08.012 --> 12:09.445
Sorry.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.409
I got pIans with Phoebe.

12:11.616 --> 12:14.449
ReaIIy? Monica said
she had a date at 9.

12:14.685 --> 12:17.381
-What? Tonight?
-That's what Monica said.

12:17.622 --> 12:22.252
After that speech, she makes a date on
the same night she has pIans with me?

12:22.460 --> 12:25.258
She's trying to puII a fast one
on Big Daddy.

12:26.597 --> 12:29.794
-Now, if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me....
-Dude, dude!

12:29.967 --> 12:33.459
If I took off my pants right now,
how wouId you feeI?

12:33.638 --> 12:35.799
Like your cousin GIenn.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.837
Here, I think this is us.

12:45.983 --> 12:48.611
Limited seating, my ass.

12:48.820 --> 12:50.913
Let's see who made the cut.

12:51.122 --> 12:53.090
Hi. I'm Monica GeIIer.

12:53.291 --> 12:56.749
-How do you know the bride and groom?
-I worked with Frannie.

12:56.994 --> 12:59.292
Used to work with her. Used to.

12:59.564 --> 13:01.828
I'm a reIative
and I didn't get invited.

13:02.099 --> 13:04.567
A bIood reIative. BIood.

13:06.137 --> 13:08.970
Stop saying ''bIood'' to strangers.

13:09.140 --> 13:13.770
From the ages of 7 to 9, we were
inseparabIe, and I didn't even get invited!

13:13.945 --> 13:16.038
Then why are you here?

13:16.214 --> 13:19.183
-I'm my brother's date.
-Hey, I had a date, okay?

13:19.350 --> 13:22.808
Joan Tedeschi, the Iinguist.

13:23.721 --> 13:26.713
So how about you?
How do you know the happy coupIe?

13:26.891 --> 13:29.121
We went to coIIege with both of them.

13:29.327 --> 13:31.420
Now we Iive ne<i>x</i>t door.

13:31.629 --> 13:33.119
Okay, you're fine.

13:34.665 --> 13:38.328
You know, you wouId've Iiked Joan,
she's very pIeasant.

13:39.437 --> 13:44.204
There! There! Her back Iooks Iike that.
That's not broad, is it?

13:49.146 --> 13:51.842
Come on, Joey, you've got to be ready
to order by now.

13:52.016 --> 13:55.315
You know, I don't I Iike this tabIe
either. Maybe we shouId move again.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.717
No, we're staying right here.
E<i>x</i>cuse me, we're ready to order.

13:58.890 --> 14:00.414
I don't work here.

14:01.459 --> 14:03.723
WeII, then you shouIdn't be
waIking around.

14:07.765 --> 14:09.892
-Are you guys ready?
-Yes.

14:10.134 --> 14:14.400
I'II have a green saIad,
house dressing and water's fine.

14:14.739 --> 14:16.172
And for you, sir?

14:16.440 --> 14:19.068
Yeah. This sIow-roasted saImon...

14:19.277 --> 14:20.801
...how sIow are we taIking?

14:21.812 --> 14:23.973
It's aIready been roasted.

14:24.248 --> 14:28.014
Oh, then no. Maybe I shouId hear
the speciaIs again.

14:28.286 --> 14:30.880
We've heard the speciaIs three times.

14:31.122 --> 14:35.115
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very speciaI Iobster ravioIi.

14:35.393 --> 14:40.023
-ActuaIIy, we're out of the ravioIi.
-WeII, that changes everything!

14:41.666 --> 14:44.464
You know what, Pheebs?
You were right before.

14:44.702 --> 14:46.693
Friends are so important.

14:46.938 --> 14:49.202
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

14:49.507 --> 14:50.997
Know what I reaIIy want?

14:51.275 --> 14:54.438
-What?
-Is to have a Iong, Iong taIk.

14:54.679 --> 14:58.615
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and reaIIy open him up.

14:59.717 --> 15:01.480
-Any progress?
-Yes.

15:02.186 --> 15:04.484
I wiII have the Iobster ravioIi.

15:05.323 --> 15:07.655
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

15:07.925 --> 15:09.483
-What's the rush?
-WeII...

15:09.727 --> 15:12.355
...I have an appointment.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.463
And it's very important.

15:14.699 --> 15:15.927
What is it?

15:16.801 --> 15:18.063
WeII...

15:18.336 --> 15:19.701
...it's a date.

15:19.971 --> 15:24.499
A date? No, you must be mistaken,
because you wouIdn't have a date...

15:24.742 --> 15:27.370
...on the same night
you have pIans with a friend.

15:27.645 --> 15:29.476
Don't make me feeI badIy.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.147
No, I'm gonna!

15:32.683 --> 15:36.380
You made me feeI reaIIy guiIty
about going out with that girI.

15:36.587 --> 15:40.523
Like I did something terribIe.
Now you're doing the same thing.

15:40.725 --> 15:43.023
It's not! It's totaIIy different!

15:43.227 --> 15:46.458
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

15:46.697 --> 15:48.255
He's very speciaI to me.

15:48.532 --> 15:52.024
My girI the other night was speciaI.
She was a scientist too.

15:52.269 --> 15:55.204
-She was?
-WeII, she graduated high schooI.

15:56.073 --> 15:57.734
Whatever. Know what?

15:58.009 --> 16:01.570
He's onIy here for four
hours and I'm gonna go see him.

16:01.779 --> 16:03.508
-Fine!
-Yeah.

16:05.716 --> 16:09.709
What are you stiII doing here?
I toId you, Iobster ravioIi!

16:13.491 --> 16:16.392
I was about to Ieave.
I didn't think you were coming.

16:16.594 --> 16:18.892
I wouIdn't have missed this.

16:19.230 --> 16:21.221
WeII, I'm very gIad you're here.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.893
Oh, you're such a gentIeman.

16:24.135 --> 16:26.194
Come on, we're going to my pIace.

16:33.010 --> 16:35.501
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

16:38.549 --> 16:41.780
I wiII give you $ 1 00
to whistIe right now.

16:46.557 --> 16:49.151
-How can you eat it without me?
-What'II you do?

16:49.427 --> 16:53.386
TeII Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to teII them everything.

16:53.631 --> 16:57.465
We're dessert steaIers.
We're Iiving outside the Iaw.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.966
I don't trust you with this cake.

17:00.171 --> 17:02.605
I got it first,
and I'm taking it back!

17:02.840 --> 17:05.673
-What? Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

17:06.177 --> 17:08.543
You think I trust you with it?

17:08.779 --> 17:10.303
No, we'II spIit it.

17:10.548 --> 17:12.345
That's not fair. You had some.

17:12.616 --> 17:15.449
I think Monica wouId be
very interested to know...

17:15.686 --> 17:18.621
...that you caIIed her cheesecake
''dry and meaIy.''

17:18.856 --> 17:21.051
What do we use to spIit it?

17:23.661 --> 17:25.629
AII right, pick a haIf.

17:26.697 --> 17:29.791
WeII, this side Iooks bigger.

17:31.001 --> 17:34.164
But there's more crust on this side.

17:34.438 --> 17:36.133
Maybe if I measure it--

17:36.373 --> 17:37.567
Pick a piece!

17:37.808 --> 17:41.676
-AII right, I pick that one.
-It's the smaIIer piece.

17:42.346 --> 17:44.280
Okay. There you go.

17:44.515 --> 17:47.507
Enjoy your haIf, my friend.
But that is it.

17:47.718 --> 17:51.085
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

17:51.288 --> 17:53.620
...if you eat your piece too fast.

18:04.201 --> 18:07.898
-You gonna give me some of yours?
-Oh, no.

18:08.205 --> 18:12.335
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

18:12.710 --> 18:15.474
I may just sit here
and have my cake aII day.

18:15.713 --> 18:18.807
Just sit here in the haIIway
and eat my--

18:30.694 --> 18:32.662
Ross, sweetheart!

18:32.897 --> 18:34.762
Oh, hey, Aunt MiIIie.

18:35.032 --> 18:39.025
-Isn't it a beautifuI wedding?
-Yes, it is.

18:43.374 --> 18:45.638
Every time, on the Iips!

18:45.876 --> 18:47.844
Why? Why on the Iips?

18:51.081 --> 18:53.641
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

18:53.884 --> 18:55.715
You be nice, aII right?

18:55.920 --> 18:58.252
I didn't bring you to ambush her.

18:58.522 --> 19:01.650
Frannie was the one
who showed your <i>Playboys</i> to Mom.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.860
That bitch.

19:08.199 --> 19:09.393
Monica!

19:09.667 --> 19:10.861
What--?

19:11.101 --> 19:13.535
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?

19:13.771 --> 19:16.171
Ross brought me.
How do you Iike that?

19:16.373 --> 19:18.864
Hi, Frannie. CongratuIations.

19:20.678 --> 19:23.875
You invite my whoIe famiIy,
and not me? Why?

19:24.114 --> 19:27.572
Why wouIdn't you want me here?
What couId I have done?

19:29.186 --> 19:30.949
Stuart!

19:31.488 --> 19:33.979
I beIieve you know my husband.

19:35.292 --> 19:39.490
So it's reaIIy a <i>q</i>uestion
of ''who'' couId you have done.

19:48.138 --> 19:50.504
I hate this, but I have to go.

19:50.741 --> 19:52.902
I can't miss my fIight.

19:53.143 --> 19:55.475
I bet there's
another fIight to Minsk in--

19:55.746 --> 19:57.441
JuIy.

20:06.924 --> 20:09.654
That's reaIIy beautifuI.
What does it mean?

20:09.927 --> 20:12.452
''PIease cIean my beakers.''

20:13.163 --> 20:15.097
I don't get out of the Iab much.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.361
I thought it meant something eIse.

20:20.638 --> 20:24.165
Yeah, weII, I reaIIy actuaIIy
wanted to say...

20:24.441 --> 20:25.931
...that.

20:26.176 --> 20:29.612
But I figured I probabIy shouIdn't
because...

20:30.614 --> 20:32.343
...I have to Ieave.

20:32.616 --> 20:35.107
No, you're right. Don't say it.

20:36.787 --> 20:38.982
I do, though.

20:41.058 --> 20:42.525
I do too.

20:51.302 --> 20:53.133
WeII, bye, Phoebe.

21:04.281 --> 21:08.012
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yeII at me tomorrow.

21:08.285 --> 21:11.049
Wait, no, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yeII at you.

21:11.322 --> 21:13.882
I just started thinking
about you and David...

21:14.158 --> 21:18.322
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he Ieft.

21:20.564 --> 21:22.555
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.029
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

21:27.404 --> 21:31.101
The onIy guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

21:31.375 --> 21:34.037
...and I may never see him again.

21:34.445 --> 21:36.072
You couId aIways visit him.

21:36.313 --> 21:38.907
Right. Like they'II Iet me
have a passport.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.083
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

21:45.022 --> 21:47.047
WeII, now...

21:47.324 --> 21:51.385
...if you achieve distiIIation of
subatomic particIes before he does...

21:51.628 --> 21:53.425
...then he couId come back.

22:00.104 --> 22:02.402
I couId give it a shot.

22:07.544 --> 22:10.945
Oh, Iook! There's a piece
that doesn't have fIoor on it.

22:11.215 --> 22:14.878
-Stick to your side!
-Come on, now!

22:25.229 --> 22:28.062
AII right, what are we having?

22:35.339 --> 22:38.934
-Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.
-Oh, I'II wait here for you.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.202
-I can't go back there!
-Why?

22:41.545 --> 22:45.037
Did you see the way Stuart was staring
at me? I think he stiII wants me.

22:45.215 --> 22:47.706
-Oh, my God.
-Just go do it!

22:47.885 --> 22:50.217
AII right, wait here.

23:07.905 --> 23:10.373
Hi, sweetie! Are you Ieaving?

23:10.607 --> 23:13.235
-WeII--
-Give us a kiss. Come on.

23:22.085 --> 23:25.851
Why? Why on the Iips?

23:32.930 --> 23:33.919
