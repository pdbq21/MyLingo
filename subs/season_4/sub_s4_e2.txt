WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:07.767
Wow. That ripped.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.472
That ripped real nice!

00:12.245 --> 00:16.409
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.081
Turn and slide.

00:18.284 --> 00:19.979
You don't turn and slide.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.915
You throw it out!

00:23.656 --> 00:26.352
I get tetanus shots
every time I get dressed!

00:26.559 --> 00:30.655
We're not throwing it out.
I built it with my own hands!

00:32.098 --> 00:33.929
How about we sell it?

00:35.802 --> 00:37.099
All right.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.396
But you'll have to tell them.

00:44.444 --> 00:48.312
Can we stick you in another cabinet?
They seem all right with it!

00:49.616 --> 00:51.481
The One with the Cat

01:36.996 --> 01:39.260
Hey, why did the chicken
fall out of the tree?

01:39.399 --> 01:40.388
Why?

01:40.567 --> 01:43.536
Because you have
doody on your head.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.940
Yeah, it was funnier
when Ben told it.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.142
Hey, Monica.
It's Chip.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.936
Who's Chip?

01:55.215 --> 01:57.615
It was good running
into you today.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.809
My number is 555-9323.
Give me a call.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.386
"Chip" is Chip Matthews.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.323
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

02:07.560 --> 02:11.462
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

02:11.664 --> 02:15.623
You're so lucky! He's like
the most popular guy in school!

02:16.402 --> 02:17.733
I know!

02:20.340 --> 02:22.331
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

02:32.585 --> 02:35.918
Oh, my God!
We just had the best conversation!

02:41.961 --> 02:43.121
I was just leaving.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.657
Good.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.694
I've got a report to read.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.629
It's eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.335
Why? Did you write it?

02:57.343 --> 02:58.833
Look at that!

02:59.112 --> 03:02.047
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.150
Well, actually....

03:05.351 --> 03:09.879
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.396
Why don't you give him a call?

03:31.978 --> 03:35.038
-Are you sure you want to hear this?
-I'm sure.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.416
Chip!
Hi, it's Rachel.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.351
Rachel Greene.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.046
You left me a message?

03:47.260 --> 03:49.660
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.995
Monica Geller?

03:59.038 --> 04:01.370
Oh, that's right!

04:03.576 --> 04:06.841
He called to ask out Monica.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.906
That's got to be embarrassing.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.685
Dumb drunken bitch

04:23.129 --> 04:24.118
Thank you!

04:27.634 --> 04:28.931
Here's a question.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.535
Where'd you get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

04:32.705 --> 04:36.368
First tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in the land.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.302
It's your ad.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.136
Looks good?

04:40.980 --> 04:44.711
"Stunning entertainment center, fine

04:45.752 --> 04:48.380
Fine ltalian craftsmanship."

04:49.922 --> 04:52.550
You're selling
the entertainment center?

04:52.825 --> 04:54.156
Why? I love it.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.191
-You want it?
-No.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.362
Gepetto?

05:01.167 --> 05:03.192
Five thousand dollars?

05:03.403 --> 05:05.064
Are you insane?

05:05.371 --> 05:08.033
The ad alone cost $300.

05:08.508 --> 05:12.035
I'm changing it
to $50 or your best offer.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.907
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

05:26.793 --> 05:28.260
What do you do?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.923
I can't believe you don't know.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.857
I actually don't know.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.537
Oh, my God, no!
Shoo, kitty!

05:41.708 --> 05:43.642
There's a kitty
in my guitar case.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.870
Everyone's gonna want one.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.277
Come on, you!

05:51.150 --> 05:52.640
Crazy!

05:53.119 --> 05:55.644
-Oh, my God!
-What?

05:55.788 --> 05:57.619
Nothing.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.189
What's wrong?

06:02.662 --> 06:07.326
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

06:08.067 --> 06:11.366
The mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?

06:12.505 --> 06:16.498
That makes the fact that she owns
beach-front property all the more impressive.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.904
No. She was a human lady.

06:19.145 --> 06:22.808
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.
The one that killed herself.

06:23.015 --> 06:27.645
Have you been taking your grandmother's
glaucoma medicine again?

06:28.354 --> 06:30.413
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

06:31.657 --> 06:35.058
I'm sure.
First of all, there's the feeling.

06:36.829 --> 06:40.560
And for another,
she went into my guitar case...

06:40.867 --> 06:43.165
...which is lined with orange felt.

06:45.772 --> 06:49.230
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.343
Cats like fish.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.177
You had me with orange felt.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.879
Hi, Mommy!

07:06.225 --> 07:09.558
I haven't seen
this smile in 17 years.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.400
-Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of
-Let it go!

07:20.973 --> 07:24.238
When were you going to tell me
that you're dating Chip?

07:25.011 --> 07:26.000
Now?

07:28.014 --> 07:29.675
Can I go out with him?

07:29.916 --> 07:34.683
No. I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.320
That thing at the prom?

07:36.522 --> 07:41.255
I couldn't find him for hours!
He was having sex with Amy Welsh!

07:42.662 --> 07:45.893
That was in high school.
How can it still bother you?

07:46.065 --> 07:50.593
Oh, yeah, you're right, Moni-cow.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.801
Okay, I hear you.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.170
Why do you have
to go out with Chip?

07:57.343 --> 07:59.038
We went to different schools.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.712
We went to the same school.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.441
You went to one where you were popular.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.780
You rode on Chip's motorcycle
and wore his letterman jacket.

08:08.988 --> 08:13.186
I went to one where I wore a band
uniform that was specially made.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.029
They had that specially made?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.558
It was a Home Ec project.

08:23.569 --> 08:27.005
Oh, my God! They said
it was for the mascot.

08:29.876 --> 08:34.643
Back then I thought that I'd never
get to go out with a Chip Matthews.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.543
Now he's called me up
and asked me out.

08:37.884 --> 08:42.014
The fat girl inside me really
wants to go. I owe her this.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.984
I never let her eat.

08:44.924 --> 08:47.893
-You go out with him.
-Really?

08:48.761 --> 08:53.095
If possible, could you leave him
and have sex with another guy?

08:53.399 --> 08:54.423
I'll try.

08:58.337 --> 09:01.431
Any luck getting rid of
the entertainment center?

09:01.607 --> 09:05.668
There were a couple calls,
but they won't work out.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.075
Joey has a very careful
screening process.

09:09.849 --> 09:14.115
Not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

09:14.353 --> 09:15.945
Stop it!

09:16.188 --> 09:20.955
She keeps trying to get away.
Just like when she was alive.

09:22.795 --> 09:25.559
How long is your mom
going to be with us?

09:25.798 --> 09:27.390
I'm not sure.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.400
I guess until she gets used to
the fact that there's...

09:31.637 --> 09:32.934
...a new mom.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.867
Now she's worried
that she'll be replaced.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.768
That's not going to happen, is it?

09:42.148 --> 09:43.706
I have to go make a call.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.645
Why not use this phone?

09:45.885 --> 09:50.379
I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.318
I just spelled the wrong word.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.525
Anyway, I don't want to do it
in front of someone with a tail.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.598
Hey, you swore you
would never tell.

10:02.535 --> 10:07.666
So am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.433
Ross, don't start.

10:11.844 --> 10:15.974
You actually believe
there's a woman inside that cat?

10:16.682 --> 10:18.115
I believe it.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.774
No, you don't.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.009
Yes, I do.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.518
No, you

10:25.024 --> 10:26.457
You know what?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.193
You won't suck me into this.

10:29.395 --> 10:33.491
Sure I will.
Because you always have to be right.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.927
I do not always have
Okay, okay.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.603
Jurassic Park could happen.

10:47.279 --> 10:52.182
And you know what? Actually,
I do think Kirk was smarter than Spock.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.692
You were kidding about the
Kirk-Spock-thing, though, right?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.195
That's pretty nice.

11:10.469 --> 11:12.130
"Pretty nice"?

11:12.738 --> 11:15.400
Pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.841
We don't have $50.
But would you trade for it?

11:20.079 --> 11:21.205
We got a canoe.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.551
I don't think we need a canoe.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.052
You got to take it.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.026
Just take the entertainment center.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.098
Then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.370
We're not throwing it away.
I built it.

11:46.605 --> 11:47.765
Good for you!

11:53.779 --> 11:57.408
You won't believe
what I found on a telephone pole.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.843
Look familiar?

11:59.118 --> 12:03.282
Apparently Phoebe's mother
also goes by the name "Julio."

12:04.957 --> 12:09.053
Wait a minute. This is not the
same cat. This cat's only this big.

12:10.763 --> 12:14.255
A little girl's looking for this cat.
Know what that means?

12:14.533 --> 12:17.366
Yeah! $200 reward split five ways!

12:20.072 --> 12:22.165
Do we have to tell her?

12:22.441 --> 12:25.604
-Yes, we do.
-But it's made her so happy.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.707
Little girl misses her cat.

12:28.914 --> 12:32.941
Crazy lady thinks
her mother is in a cat.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.085
I have to go have
dinner with my son.

12:36.288 --> 12:39.689
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.088
Thank you.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.259
I hate when Ross is right.

12:47.533 --> 12:48.693
He is right, isn't he?

12:48.934 --> 12:51.664
This might be one time
when he's wrong.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.796
-You think?
-Oh, no. He's right.

13:07.853 --> 13:09.411
About your mom.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.150
How's that going?

13:15.427 --> 13:18.328
So great.
We took a nap together today.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.998
Mom fell asleep
on my tummy and purred.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.996
That's so sweet.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.231
I'm gonna get some coffee.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.448
What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.452
I just feel so....

13:45.691 --> 13:47.852
-All right!
-I'm coming already!

13:54.567 --> 13:57.127
Not yet, not yet, not yet!

14:03.275 --> 14:05.038
-Hello, Chip.
-How you doing?

14:05.277 --> 14:06.608
I'm great!

14:06.812 --> 14:09.872
Got a great job.
I have wonderful friends.

14:10.082 --> 14:14.917
Though I'm not seeing anyone now,
I've never felt better about myself.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.781
So, Monica ready yet?

14:22.228 --> 14:23.991
She'll be out in a second.

14:24.296 --> 14:27.493
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?

14:27.733 --> 14:30.793
Amy Welsh?
I haven't seen her since

14:33.138 --> 14:36.073
So, Monica about ready?

14:38.010 --> 14:40.604
-Wow, you look great.
-Thanks.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.237
-Well, you guys have fun.
-Catch you later.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.282
Bye, Chip.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.212
-Are you sure you're okay about this?
-Actually

14:48.387 --> 14:50.582
Okay, great.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.185
This is the unit for you.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.191
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.864
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.462
-What?
-Yeah, I got in there myself once.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.898
My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.803
Then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.570
It was funny till I felt
like it was a coffin.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.051
No, you can't fit in there.
It's not deep enough.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.418
Oh, yeah?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.080
If I can't...

15:26.625 --> 15:29.116
...I'll knock $5 off the price.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.688
All right, you have
yourself a deal.

15:36.402 --> 15:38.427
See?
I told you.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.734
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.311
Hey, a nickel!

15:53.319 --> 15:54.308
Here we are.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.611
You still have the Chipper!

15:56.889 --> 15:58.049
The what?

15:58.557 --> 16:02.220
That's what we called
your motorcycle in high school.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.122
A motorcycle's a chopper.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.421
And you're Chip.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.097
Never mind.

16:09.168 --> 16:10.795
I think it's cute.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.436
A lipper from Chipper.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.776
Are you still in touch with anyone?

16:23.015 --> 16:25.006
There's Rachel...

16:26.018 --> 16:28.145
...and that's it.
How about you?

16:28.420 --> 16:33.483
I still hang with Simens and Zana.
I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.683
I run into Goldie...

16:35.995 --> 16:38.395
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

16:38.664 --> 16:40.859
...J.T., Beardsley.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.422
Is that all?

16:42.701 --> 16:45.864
After high school,
you kind of lose touch.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.003
I ran into Richard Dorfman.

16:49.274 --> 16:52.334
-How is he?
-Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.012
Isn't he an architect?

16:56.248 --> 16:57.943
They still wear underwear.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.390
Oh, my God!

17:14.700 --> 17:15.689
What?

17:18.604 --> 17:20.469
Are you all right?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.308
What happened?

17:24.977 --> 17:28.970
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

17:29.214 --> 17:33.947
How were you locked in?
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

17:34.319 --> 17:36.651
This guy came by
to look at the unit...

17:36.955 --> 17:39.446
...and he said
it won't fit a grown man.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.725
So you got in voluntarily?

17:42.961 --> 17:45.589
I was trying to make a sale!

17:45.831 --> 17:49.096
If I ever run into him,
you know what I'll do?

17:49.334 --> 17:50.961
Bend over?

17:55.741 --> 17:59.507
And then Zana just let one rip!

18:03.916 --> 18:07.352
Not that I don't enjoy
talking about high school...

18:07.619 --> 18:09.484
...because I do.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.016
Maybe we can talk
about something else.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.623
I don't know where you work.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.293
-You know where I work.
-I do?

18:17.529 --> 18:20.987
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.866
Still at the Multiplex?

18:23.135 --> 18:25.433
Like I'd give up that job!

18:26.305 --> 18:28.865
Free popcorn and candy
anytime I want?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.439
I can get you posters.

18:30.676 --> 18:31.938
Thanks, I'm set.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.877
Oh, you know who came
in the other night? Peters.

18:36.014 --> 18:40.178
Told me he just went out with
Leslie Maskin. Got to third base.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.248
Do you still live
with your parents?

18:46.492 --> 18:49.586
Yeah, but I can stay out
as late as I want.

18:55.167 --> 19:00.036
You know, with all of our stuff gone,
the unit doesn't seem that big.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.670
Why couldn't he have been a kidnapper.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.839
They really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.845
Your microwave, the stereo.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.516
Man, he took the five of spades!

19:16.455 --> 19:18.548
No, here it is.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.393
Oh, my God! What happened?

19:22.628 --> 19:26.564
Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed!

19:30.636 --> 19:32.467
So how was your date?

19:32.704 --> 19:36.037
Well, I always wanted to go out
with Chip in high school.

19:36.308 --> 19:40.335
Tonight, I actually went out
with Chip in high school.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.837
Honey, I'm sorry.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.049
Not only did I get
to go out with Chip...

19:46.285 --> 19:48.082
...I got to dump Chip.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.383
-That's so great!
-I know.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.051
What did the insurance company say?

19:56.295 --> 20:00.231
They said, "You don't have insurance.
Stop calling us."

20:04.169 --> 20:05.636
You didn't tell her?

20:09.474 --> 20:10.702
Okay, fine.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.208
Listen...

20:17.349 --> 20:20.409
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.882
There are flyers all over the place.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.420
I'm sorry, sweetie.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.488
We can take her
back with you if you want.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.695
But, you know, she chose to find me.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.534
I have to respect her decision, right?

20:41.340 --> 20:43.865
-That's a good call.
-That's right.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.405
Enough is enough.

20:46.678 --> 20:50.944
I'm sorry you feel guilty about
spending time with your new mom.

20:51.216 --> 20:52.877
But this isn't your old mom.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.550
This is a cat.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.016
Julio the cat.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.387
Not Mom! Cat.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.029
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

21:12.204 --> 21:13.603
None.

21:13.739 --> 21:17.368
Then you don't know how it feels
when one of them comes back.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.040
I believe this is my mother.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.478
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

21:26.885 --> 21:29.786
Just be a friend, okay?
Be supportive.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.716
I'm sorry.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.485
Okay.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.155
I don't know what to say.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.336
You could say...

21:45.537 --> 21:47.835
...you're sorry to her mom.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.376
I think she would like that.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.627
Come here. Here, come here.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.428
Mrs. Buffay?

22:17.402 --> 22:19.893
Sorry about what I said.

22:20.105 --> 22:23.268
It was insensitive of me to say...

22:23.542 --> 22:26.067
...that you were just a cat...

22:28.246 --> 22:30.077
...when, clearly, you are also...

22:30.282 --> 22:32.910
...the reincarnated spirit...

22:34.086 --> 22:35.986
...of my friend's mother.

22:38.256 --> 22:39.416
Thank you.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.483
We both forgive you.

22:44.262 --> 22:46.992
What will you do about
the little girl?

22:48.166 --> 22:49.326
Listen.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.595
Mom, I hope you know
you still mean a lot to me.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.365
You're welcome
to come back anytime.

22:58.377 --> 23:02.006
If she'd come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.543
Come on.
I'll take you home.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.776
-I'll go with you.
-Me too.

23:09.921 --> 23:11.786
I got an extra futon.

23:12.324 --> 23:15.885
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.761
You know....

23:53.298 --> 23:55.698
It's peaceful out here.
