WEBVTT

00:04.071 --> 00:05.163
Ross kissed me.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.804
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:09.076 --> 00:10.441
It was unbelievable!

00:10.644 --> 00:13.738
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:13.948 --> 00:15.313
Let's hear everything.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.151
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.850
Rachel, does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.347
It ended very well.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.360
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

00:28.596 --> 00:31.190
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.798
Was it a soft brush
against your lips...

00:34.034 --> 00:37.697
...or was it a "I gotta have you now"
kind of thing?

00:38.138 --> 00:42.268
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then....

00:42.476 --> 00:45.843
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.641
So was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

00:49.883 --> 00:53.341
No, actually, first
they started out on my waist...

00:53.621 --> 00:56.181
...and then they slid up
and were in my hair.

00:59.526 --> 01:00.493
And...

01:00.694 --> 01:02.025
...then I kissed her.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.059
Tongue?

01:03.330 --> 01:05.059
-Yeah.
-Cool.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.693
The One With the List

01:52.013 --> 01:54.106
All right, check out this bad boy!

01:54.382 --> 01:57.681
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

01:57.952 --> 01:59.715
... built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

01:59.954 --> 02:03.754
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.854
What will you use it for?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.457
Games and stuff.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.958
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.928
Oh, wait, here's one.

02:15.770 --> 02:19.934
-Would you be willing to cook naked?
-There's an ad for a naked chef?

02:20.141 --> 02:24.874
No, but if you'll cook naked, then
you might be willing to dance naked.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.545
And then....

02:30.284 --> 02:32.411
So how'd you make out last night?

02:36.290 --> 02:38.781
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.392
No, wait, wait.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.925
Yeah, that's just painful.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.258
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.331
Yeah, it was.
But I get home...

02:48.602 --> 02:51.730
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

02:52.106 --> 02:54.438
...and I think,
"My God! What am I doing?"

02:54.642 --> 02:57.543
Here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

02:57.745 --> 03:00.441
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

03:00.681 --> 03:02.774
...and I'm just
throwing all that away?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.410
You got all that
from saline solution?

03:06.910 --> 03:11.010
I'm the same way.Show me a bottle of wine.
and I'm like, Wow, who am I?

03:13.254 --> 03:16.553
Wait. We're talking about Rachel.
You and Rachel.

03:16.758 --> 03:19.727
I've been dreaming about
me and Rachel for 10 years.

03:19.927 --> 03:21.656
But now I'm with Julie.

03:21.896 --> 03:24.763
So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

03:24.999 --> 03:27.092
Me and Julie, me and Rach

03:27.735 --> 03:28.895
Rachel! Rachel.

03:30.104 --> 03:32.231
-Hey, you.
-How are you?

03:32.540 --> 03:33.939
Good. How are you?

03:34.208 --> 03:35.197
Good.

03:35.610 --> 03:38.078
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

03:39.013 --> 03:39.843
Julie!

03:41.849 --> 03:42.713
How are you?

03:42.917 --> 03:44.111
Good.

03:44.585 --> 03:45.950
So everybody's here.

03:47.121 --> 03:48.748
Everybody's good.

03:49.748 --> 03:52.248
Good, Great, and here!

03:54.426 --> 03:56.621
Were you gonna play something?

03:56.895 --> 03:58.920
-Well, actually
-Play it!

04:01.033 --> 04:02.295
All right.

04:02.901 --> 04:05.631
-Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
-What?

04:07.973 --> 04:09.440
Okay. Hi.

04:09.741 --> 04:12.266
Hello. Hi. Okay.

04:13.779 --> 04:16.839
This is a song about a love triangle...

04:17.082 --> 04:19.073
... between three people I made up.

04:22.955 --> 04:25.617
It's called
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

04:29.194 --> 04:32.857
There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

04:33.098 --> 04:36.363
And a guy
Let's call him Neil

04:37.102 --> 04:40.936
Now I can't stress
This point too strongly

04:41.140 --> 04:43.370
This story isn't real

04:46.545 --> 04:51.278
Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside

04:51.550 --> 04:53.711
Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly

04:53.952 --> 04:57.285
Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie

05:00.926 --> 05:03.224
He must decide
He must decide

05:03.462 --> 05:06.829
Even though I made him up
He must decide

05:10.569 --> 05:13.003
Well, this is a nice resume.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.573
Nice, nice, nice.

05:16.074 --> 05:17.769
Muy impressivo.

05:18.769 --> 05:20.269
Shame! It not all true.

05:22.269 --> 05:23.269
Forget it.

05:24.269 --> 05:27.269
No, it's all true.
I'm just a little nervous, that's all!

05:27.769 --> 05:29.577
I am fine now.

05:29.577 --> 05:33.513
Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

05:34.816 --> 05:36.181
Macholate.

05:36.985 --> 05:38.282
-I'm sorry?
-Macholate.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.750
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

05:43.992 --> 05:45.584
Go ahead, try a piece.

05:45.794 --> 05:48.820
We think Macholate is
even better than chocolate.

05:49.030 --> 05:50.019
All right.

05:59.341 --> 06:01.206
I love how it crumbles.

06:01.876 --> 06:04.777
-You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
-No, ma'am.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.815
We should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

06:10.452 --> 06:12.943
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

06:13.154 --> 06:15.622
The way we see it,
chocolate dominates...

06:15.857 --> 06:20.658
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

06:20.895 --> 06:22.954
But given the right marketing...

06:23.198 --> 06:25.689
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Macholate holiday.

06:27.235 --> 06:28.167
Wow.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.035
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

06:31.740 --> 06:34.174
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

06:34.376 --> 06:35.809
Isn't that great?

06:38.346 --> 06:39.643
Well, anyhow...

06:39.881 --> 06:43.339
...we're looking for chefs
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

06:43.585 --> 06:44.813
You interested?

06:45.019 --> 06:45.883
Abso-...

06:47.322 --> 06:48.414
... -lutely!

06:50.325 --> 06:53.817
I love creating recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and now...

06:54.062 --> 06:55.222
... I love Macholate.

06:55.497 --> 06:56.521
Really?

06:56.765 --> 06:59.427
Especially that aftertaste.
I tell you...

06:59.667 --> 07:01.692
...that'll last you till Christmas.

07:06.274 --> 07:07.741
How about Macholate mousse?

07:08.243 --> 07:09.403
It's not...

07:09.677 --> 07:11.235
...very Thanksgiving-y.

07:11.713 --> 07:14.238
How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

07:15.250 --> 07:16.410
What makes it Pilgrim?

07:16.785 --> 07:18.582
We'll put buckles on it.

07:22.123 --> 07:23.351
Did Ross call?

07:23.591 --> 07:25.252
No, I'm sorry.

07:25.693 --> 07:27.593
Why didn't he call?

07:28.029 --> 07:29.621
He's gonna stay with Julie.

07:29.864 --> 07:31.957
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

07:32.233 --> 07:34.463
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

07:34.736 --> 07:38.797
We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

07:40.475 --> 07:43.137
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

07:46.080 --> 07:50.073
What am I gonna do?
This is like a complete nightmare!

07:50.318 --> 07:54.448
I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

07:55.790 --> 07:59.055
They're both gorgeous,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

07:59.260 --> 08:01.751
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

08:03.164 --> 08:06.759
-Here's a thought
-Don't ever touch the computer.

08:08.169 --> 08:10.967
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

08:11.239 --> 08:12.399
Threesome.

08:18.399 --> 08:20.599
You still have another word if you have not use.

08:21.899 --> 08:25.399
Hey, I think I know what is it, HELP!

08:25.644 --> 08:28.408
Let's get logical about this.
We'll make a list.

08:28.614 --> 08:31.048
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

08:35.254 --> 08:37.984
We'll put their names
in different fonts...

08:38.223 --> 08:40.657
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

08:41.093 --> 08:42.287
Can't we use a pen?

08:42.594 --> 08:44.425
No, Amish boy.

08:46.398 --> 08:50.061
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

08:50.335 --> 08:51.165
Rachel first.

08:52.171 --> 08:53.331
I don't know.

08:53.839 --> 08:55.067
I mean....

08:55.274 --> 08:59.802
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

09:00.245 --> 09:01.940
You could say that.

09:03.816 --> 09:07.775
I guess, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

09:08.153 --> 09:11.088
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

09:11.757 --> 09:13.816
And Julie and I have
a lot in common...

09:14.092 --> 09:16.959
... because we're both
paleontologists, right?

09:17.196 --> 09:19.027
But Rachel's just a waitress.

09:19.264 --> 09:20.663
Waitress.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.191
Got it.
You guys want to play Doom?

09:25.938 --> 09:27.997
Or we could keep doing this.

09:29.775 --> 09:30.969
What else?

09:31.610 --> 09:32.941
I don't know.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.471
Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

09:39.318 --> 09:40.649
Okay, let's do Julie.

09:40.953 --> 09:42.181
What's wrong with her?

09:45.891 --> 09:47.825
She's not Rachel.

09:49.996 --> 09:52.897
This is pumpkin pie
with a Macholate crust.

09:53.099 --> 09:56.796
This is Macholate cranberry cake,
and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

09:57.103 --> 09:59.128
Just like the lndians served.

10:02.742 --> 10:03.606
Oh, my God!

10:03.944 --> 10:04.842
"Oh, my God" good?

10:05.111 --> 10:08.672
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

10:09.816 --> 10:13.411
Sweet Lord!
This is what evil must taste like!

10:19.526 --> 10:21.289
I tell you, it won't print.

10:22.529 --> 10:25.191
I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

10:25.432 --> 10:27.366
For a hotline, you're not so hot.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.532
What is that in the background?

10:31.805 --> 10:33.204
Are you watching Star Trek?

10:40.614 --> 10:42.946
So how was going with Julie.
Did you break her heart?

10:44.451 --> 10:48.945
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.019
I did the right thing.

10:53.293 --> 10:55.853
So Spock actually hugs his father?

10:57.897 --> 10:59.626
Hey, do you guys have

11:03.903 --> 11:04.801
Where you going?

11:05.005 --> 11:07.405
I just got back...

11:08.575 --> 11:09.837
...from Julie's.

11:12.512 --> 11:13.536
No, no.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.644
It's not what you think.

11:15.882 --> 11:17.509
It's the other thing.

11:24.491 --> 11:27.654
Well, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

11:29.896 --> 11:31.090
Well....

11:31.364 --> 11:32.524
He broke up with Julie!

11:34.200 --> 11:37.328
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

11:38.738 --> 11:39.705
Really?

11:39.906 --> 11:40.838
Really.

11:41.941 --> 11:43.841
It's always been you, Rach.

11:44.077 --> 11:45.738
Oh, God.

11:57.424 --> 11:59.016
Oh, this is good.

11:59.225 --> 12:01.284
-This is really good.
-I know. I know.

12:01.561 --> 12:03.085
It's almost....

12:09.703 --> 12:12.797
What do you say we take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

12:13.039 --> 12:15.599
-Let me get my coat.
-Okay. No, hey!

12:16.476 --> 12:17.909
I'll get your coat.

12:25.285 --> 12:28.652
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

12:28.955 --> 12:33.051
Joey, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

12:33.293 --> 12:35.727
-What's that?
-What? Nothing!

12:37.897 --> 12:41.264
-I saw my name. What is it?
-No, no, see? See?

12:41.468 --> 12:42.298
It's printing!

12:43.770 --> 12:44.600
It's printing!

12:46.639 --> 12:47.901
Let me see!

12:48.108 --> 12:49.735
Hey, someone order a coat?

12:49.943 --> 12:53.276
Chandler wrote something about me
and won't let me see.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.345
He won't? He won't!

12:57.317 --> 12:58.909
Because isn't that...

12:59.152 --> 13:01.245
...the short story you were writing?

13:02.322 --> 13:04.517
Yes, it is a short story...

13:04.791 --> 13:06.019
...that I was writing.

13:06.259 --> 13:08.124
And I'm in it?
Let me read it.

13:08.361 --> 13:09.328
No!

13:11.698 --> 13:15.429
-Come on!
-Hey, why don't you read it to her?

13:25.612 --> 13:26.772
All right.

13:36.656 --> 13:38.021
"It was summer.

13:40.527 --> 13:41.892
And it was hot.

13:42.962 --> 13:44.554
Rachel was there.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.060
A lonely gray couch.

13:52.372 --> 13:54.237
'Oh, look!' cried Ned.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.976
And the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

14:01.648 --> 14:04.913
That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

14:06.186 --> 14:07.813
This isn't funny anymore.

14:08.054 --> 14:12.047
There's something about me
on that paper, and I want to see it.

14:12.325 --> 14:13.383
No, you don't.

14:15.895 --> 14:19.831
All right, fine. If you guys want
to be children, that's fine.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.660
I do not need to see it!

14:28.341 --> 14:29.205
What is this?

14:29.576 --> 14:30.873
That is....

14:32.512 --> 14:33.376
What is this?

14:33.580 --> 14:35.241
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

14:38.585 --> 14:42.021
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

14:42.355 --> 14:43.379
"Kind of ditzy"?

14:44.424 --> 14:45.755
"Too into her looks"?

14:47.126 --> 14:48.115
"Spoiled"?

14:48.394 --> 14:51.921
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

14:53.433 --> 14:55.264
"Just a waitress"?

14:56.569 --> 14:58.298
Now that was....

14:58.738 --> 15:00.865
I mean, as opposed to....

15:02.375 --> 15:04.707
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

15:05.478 --> 15:08.879
I do not have chubby ankles!

15:09.082 --> 15:10.242
No! I

15:10.483 --> 15:13.611
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

15:14.487 --> 15:15.954
"She's not Rachem"?

15:17.423 --> 15:18.822
What the hell's a Rachem?

15:19.125 --> 15:21.150
Is that a stupid paleontology word...

15:21.394 --> 15:23.726
... I wouldn't know,
because I'm just a waitress?

15:24.297 --> 15:25.787
Rach, come on!

15:28.001 --> 15:29.832
It's "She's not Rachel"!

15:30.103 --> 15:31.934
She's not....

15:39.913 --> 15:41.278
My diary! Brilliant!

15:41.481 --> 15:45.315
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

15:45.518 --> 15:50.080
That's true. You'd be a great person
to have around after an emergency.

15:51.624 --> 15:53.956
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

15:54.193 --> 15:56.627
-I know.
-What a dinkus!

15:57.864 --> 16:01.027
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

16:01.367 --> 16:02.664
What?

16:02.869 --> 16:05.360
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

16:06.606 --> 16:07.971
This was your idea?

16:08.207 --> 16:12.644
Let's get some perspective here.
These things happen for a reason.

16:12.845 --> 16:14.506
Yeah. You!

16:15.949 --> 16:20.147
Pheebs, back me up. You believe
in that karma crap, don't you?

16:20.887 --> 16:24.220
By the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

16:42.075 --> 16:43.064
Rach!

16:46.012 --> 16:48.378
Hey! Open up! Please?

16:48.715 --> 16:52.651
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away."

16:52.852 --> 16:55.047
It doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

16:55.321 --> 16:57.881
I just want to read you
your "Pro List."

16:58.358 --> 16:59.552
Not interested.

17:01.494 --> 17:04.759
"Number one:
the way you cry at game shows.

17:05.231 --> 17:08.758
Number two:
how much you love your friends.

17:09.002 --> 17:12.995
Number three: the way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

17:13.239 --> 17:17.073
Number four: how brave you are
for starting your life over.

17:17.343 --> 17:20.403
Number five:
how great you are with Ben.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.342
Number six: the way you smell."

17:25.585 --> 17:26.677
What are you doing?

17:27.186 --> 17:28.744
You want to open the window?

17:29.022 --> 17:29.886
Oh, yeah.

17:31.624 --> 17:33.956
-What are you doing out there?
-I'm....

17:34.227 --> 17:36.695
You must be freezing.
You know what you need?

17:36.929 --> 17:40.023
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Macholate?

17:44.237 --> 17:45.363
Come on, open up.

17:46.706 --> 17:49.641
Rach, come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

17:50.043 --> 17:50.873
No.

17:51.944 --> 17:54.037
-No?
-That's what I said.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.305
Maybe we should go.

17:55.581 --> 17:57.640
You don't have to go.
We're done.

17:57.884 --> 17:59.408
I know how you must

17:59.619 --> 18:01.314
No! You don't, Ross.

18:01.954 --> 18:05.822
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

18:06.092 --> 18:10.290
How would you feel if the person
you trusted most in the world...

18:10.496 --> 18:12.157
... not only thinks them too...

18:12.398 --> 18:16.334
... but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

18:16.569 --> 18:21.006
No, but see, I want to be with you
in spite of all those things.

18:21.908 --> 18:24.502
Well, that's mighty big of you.

18:24.811 --> 18:25.641
I said, don't go!

18:29.482 --> 18:30.744
You know what?

18:30.950 --> 18:35.751
If it were the other way around, there
is nothing you could put on a list...

18:35.988 --> 18:38.650
...that would make me
not want to be with you.

18:39.425 --> 18:42.588
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

18:42.829 --> 18:45.263
See, I'd never make a list.

19:00.980 --> 19:05.508
I never know how long to wait
in this situation before you can talk.

19:07.653 --> 19:09.018
Maybe a little longer.

19:14.627 --> 19:17.687
In these recipes,
the quantities may seem unusual.

19:17.964 --> 19:20.956
Like these coconut Macholate
holiday nut bars?

19:21.167 --> 19:24.261
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of nuts...

19:24.470 --> 19:27.564
...and only one tablespoon
of Macholate.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.502
Doesn't matter.

19:31.410 --> 19:33.878
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

19:34.147 --> 19:37.014
Something about laboratory rats.

19:38.184 --> 19:39.208
Gosh, I'm sorry.

19:39.418 --> 19:40.248
Yeah.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.851
Anyhow, here's your check.

19:44.157 --> 19:46.523
Thank you for all the trouble
you went through.

19:46.993 --> 19:51.020
Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

19:51.230 --> 19:52.697
Well, I ate some.

19:52.932 --> 19:55.662
Oh, some is fine.
Some is not a lot.

19:57.036 --> 20:00.005
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

20:17.924 --> 20:19.221
Is that him again?

20:19.559 --> 20:23.188
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

20:25.865 --> 20:27.958
I don't think this is the best time.

20:28.234 --> 20:31.101
Look, can you do something for me?

20:31.370 --> 20:32.701
Sure. What?

20:36.709 --> 20:37.698
All right.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.372
Music?

20:43.082 --> 20:43.980
Sure.

20:51.224 --> 20:54.159
The next one's dedicated
to Rachel from Ross.

20:54.427 --> 20:57.260
Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...

20:57.496 --> 21:00.260
...and he hopes you can forgive him.

21:00.666 --> 21:05.069
See the stones set in your eyes

21:05.271 --> 21:09.332
See the thorn twist in your side

21:09.809 --> 21:13.506
I'll wait for you

21:18.584 --> 21:21.951
Sleight of hand and twist of fate

21:22.588 --> 21:27.252
On a bed of nails she makes me wait

21:27.526 --> 21:31.860
And I'll wait without you

21:32.164 --> 21:36.999
We've just gotten a call from Rachel
and she told us what Ross did.

21:37.270 --> 21:40.205
It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...

21:40.473 --> 21:43.135
...I don't want to play
your song anymore.

21:48.881 --> 21:51.714
Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?

21:51.984 --> 21:54.418
Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...

21:54.620 --> 21:56.850
...and she hopes you two
will work it out.

21:57.690 --> 22:00.215
There's a room where

22:00.493 --> 22:03.860
I can go

22:04.130 --> 22:08.624
And tell my secrets to

22:09.869 --> 22:12.360
In my room

22:16.375 --> 22:18.969
In my room

22:30.990 --> 22:32.924
Thanks for coming in again.

22:33.192 --> 22:35.922
Not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

22:36.495 --> 22:38.326
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

22:39.532 --> 22:42.660
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

22:43.736 --> 22:46.364
They taste exactly
like pistachios...

22:46.572 --> 22:49.564
... but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

22:50.076 --> 22:51.668
Here, try one.

22:52.712 --> 22:54.907
-All right.
-You're not allergic to anything?

22:55.748 --> 22:56.578
Cat hair.

22:56.782 --> 22:58.215
Oh, sorry.
