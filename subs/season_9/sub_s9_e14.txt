00:03.006 --> 00:04.999
-Morning, roomie.
-Hey!

00:05.210 --> 00:09.082
You remembered
to put clothes on this morning.

00:09.251 --> 00:11.745
Fifth day's a charm.

00:11.957 --> 00:17.298
lt's so great to be back here. You're
making it so easy on me and Emma.

00:17.502 --> 00:20.439
lt's great having you back.
Stay as long as you want.

00:20.608 --> 00:24.445
And when does she stop
crying all night?

00:26.285 --> 00:30.089
Hey! You're not naked.

00:30.293 --> 00:32.764
Rach, when will we expect
to see you tonight?

00:32.932 --> 00:36.804
Probably around 6. But she's
in the bedroom, all ready to go.

00:36.973 --> 00:38.772
But she fell back to sleep, so....

00:38.977 --> 00:43.077
She's probably exhausted from all that
adorable screaming she did last night.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.718
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:45.323 --> 00:48.124
Hey, l hope Emma isn't
making it too hard on you.

00:48.296 --> 00:50.459
No, hey, it's been great.

00:50.668 --> 00:53.504
l just want you to know that
with Rachel staying here...

00:53.674 --> 00:56.874
...all my feelings from before
are totally over.

00:57.047 --> 00:58.379
And even if they weren't...

00:58.550 --> 01:01.020
...when you walk in on a woman
using a breast pump....

01:01.255 --> 01:03.749
-Yeah, that'll do it.
-Wow!

01:04.294 --> 01:06.230
So how are you?

01:06.398 --> 01:08.459
-l'm okay.
-Really?

01:08.637 --> 01:12.805
Sure. l mean, do l wish me and Rachel
living together would have worked out?

01:12.979 --> 01:16.817
Of course. You know, l'm disappointed,
but it's not like it's a divorce.

01:18.489 --> 01:21.519
-Well, actually it--
-lt's not a divorce. lt is not a divorce!

01:23.700 --> 01:26.695
Anyway, l think Rachel and l
need to get on with our lives.

01:26.873 --> 01:29.309
Maybe start seeing other people.

01:30.213 --> 01:32.012
Wow. Really?

01:32.217 --> 01:35.679
Sure, why not? ln fact, if you know
anyone that'd be good for me...?

01:35.858 --> 01:38.921
-Sure. l know lots of girls.
-Any names come to mind?

01:39.866 --> 01:41.391
Names?

02:34.207 --> 02:37.270
-l was about to eat. Want something?
-What you got?

02:37.447 --> 02:41.080
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,
strained carrots...

02:41.255 --> 02:43.920
...strained plums.
We haven't tried that yet!

02:44.127 --> 02:45.390
Goody!

02:45.964 --> 02:48.400
Thanks.

02:48.937 --> 02:51.636
So how is it living with Rachel again?

02:51.843 --> 02:54.439
l mean, apart from the great food?

02:54.649 --> 02:56.481
l'm fine, l'm fine. lt's just....

02:56.653 --> 02:59.146
lt's just weird what's happening
with her and Ross.

02:59.358 --> 03:01.852
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up
with somebody.

03:02.063 --> 03:04.557
Rachel asked me
if l knew anyone for her too.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.796
-Why are they doing this?
-l don't know.

03:07.006 --> 03:09.374
They're so perfect for each other.
lt's crazy.

03:09.579 --> 03:11.674
You know what's crazy? These jars.

03:11.883 --> 03:15.618
What is there, like, two bites in here?

03:17.661 --> 03:20.325
l just wish they'd realize
they should be together.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.996
When they moved in together, l figured
that's where things were headed.

03:24.207 --> 03:27.441
They should be a family. They should
marry and have more children.

03:27.615 --> 03:31.953
Yes. And they should name
one of their kids Joey.

03:32.190 --> 03:35.630
l may not have kids. Someone's
gotta carry on the family name.

03:37.835 --> 03:41.399
You know what? Maybe once they
start dating and see what's out there...

03:41.576 --> 03:44.308
...they'll realize how good
they are for each other.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.315
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

03:47.487 --> 03:50.551
l had this date last night. Yuck!

03:50.727 --> 03:54.325
But we should probably keep it down,
she's still in the bedroom.

03:56.104 --> 03:59.509
So, what are we gonna do? Are we
just gonna set them up with people?

03:59.712 --> 04:03.378
l know, that just pushes them
further and further apart.

04:03.553 --> 04:07.185
l know what we can do. We could set
Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...

04:07.360 --> 04:09.888
...so they'll realize
how good they are together.

04:10.099 --> 04:12.194
-That's a great plan.
-Yeah.

04:12.403 --> 04:16.708
You know what the best part of it is?
l get to do my plan laugh.

04:21.756 --> 04:26.220
Okay, shh! Not so loud.
We don't want to wake up....

04:39.124 --> 04:42.494
Hi. You guys aren't
doing anything tonight, are you?

04:42.698 --> 04:46.193
See, now, why would you assume that?
Just because we're married?

04:46.438 --> 04:51.142
l mean, l will have you know that
we are very hip, happening people.

04:51.315 --> 04:55.483
Now if you'll excuse me, l have to
get back to reading the obituaries.

04:56.191 --> 04:59.288
l was just asking because l need
someone to watch Emma tonight.

04:59.497 --> 05:01.228
Sure we'll do it.
What are you up to?

05:01.468 --> 05:04.463
-Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
-Oh, my God.

05:04.642 --> 05:08.707
-Why? What's the big deal?
-l figured because you and Ross are--

05:08.883 --> 05:12.983
What? Slept together a year
and a half ago? Yeah, l'm all set.

05:14.629 --> 05:17.658
l think it's great you're going on a date.
lt sounds healthy.

05:17.835 --> 05:21.536
l mean, you have needs.
Embrace your womanhood.

05:22.210 --> 05:25.741
You want a job? Turn off <i>Oprah</i>
and send out a résumé.

05:28.088 --> 05:30.719
-l'll bring her by around 7, okay?
-That's perfect.

05:30.894 --> 05:34.355
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
She's at such a cute age.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.201
A couple things. Now that she eats
solid food, she poops around the clock.

05:38.375 --> 05:41.142
And watch out for your hair
because she likes to grab it.

05:41.314 --> 05:45.779
She's also in this phase where if you
leave the room, she screams, but....

05:45.957 --> 05:47.927
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.

05:50.299 --> 05:54.741
Suddenly l wish l was reading
my own name.

05:56.946 --> 05:59.850
Joey, hey. l'm so excited.

06:00.019 --> 06:03.789
-l set Rachel up with the worst guy.
-All right. Who is he?

06:03.993 --> 06:06.293
lt's a guy l used to massage.
By ''massage'' ...

06:06.465 --> 06:10.496
...l mean hold down so he wouldn't
turn over and flash me.

06:10.674 --> 06:14.374
-Wait till you hear who l got for Ross.
-Oh, yeah.

06:14.548 --> 06:19.820
Okay. She's this really boring woman.
She's a teacher.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.862
-A teacher?
-She's into history and foreign movies.

06:25.035 --> 06:27.028
And she loves puzzles.

06:28.075 --> 06:30.307
Come on, who loves puzzles?

06:30.479 --> 06:32.210
Well, Ross does.

06:33.653 --> 06:35.816
You're ruining the plan!

06:35.991 --> 06:39.157
Joey, you fixed him up
with his perfect woman.

06:39.364 --> 06:41.197
-Oh, my God, you're right!
-Yeah.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.204
She even reads for pleasure!

06:45.376 --> 06:49.750
-How do you know a woman like that?
-l'm not allowed to know smart women?

06:50.019 --> 06:53.720
-Joey?
-We met at the library. l went in to pee.

06:55.931 --> 06:58.698
-So now what do we do?
-Well, okay.

06:58.870 --> 07:02.776
l'll call her and tell her the date's
canceled and find him somebody else.

07:04.447 --> 07:08.217
What if we don't find him somebody
else? We'll just tell her the date's off...

07:08.388 --> 07:12.762
...but we don't tell Ross. He'll go
to the restaurant and get stood up.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.999
l hear that's bad.

07:16.438 --> 07:19.467
So this is great. Rachel's
gonna have a terrible date...

07:19.645 --> 07:23.642
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll
realize how good they have it together.

07:23.887 --> 07:25.584
Yes, the plan.

07:28.897 --> 07:30.422
lt's not Santa's plan.

07:33.272 --> 07:35.265
No, it's....

07:40.185 --> 07:44.627
-Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
-No, l think we killed it.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.136
Emma? Emma, look at me!

07:49.538 --> 07:54.070
Well, l think l'll go downstairs
for a while.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.193
No, no, no! lt's okay! lt's okay!
l didn't go!

08:03.365 --> 08:05.598
Don't cry, it's just a bit!

08:05.770 --> 08:09.505
l'm your Uncle Chandler.
Funny is all l have!

08:10.079 --> 08:14.179
Okay, just so you know, l'm gonna be
ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.

08:14.387 --> 08:17.554
So don't touch yourself
for the next 4<i>8</i> hours.

08:18.596 --> 08:20.725
l don't do that.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.633
l'll try to stop.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.076
-Did you say until the 6th?
-Yeah.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.907
Today is the 6th.

08:28.081 --> 08:30.210
No, it's not.

08:31.054 --> 08:34.083
Yes, it's also 2003.

08:34.293 --> 08:36.821
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?

08:37.033 --> 08:38.832
l may be done ovulating!

08:39.037 --> 08:43.410
l may have also served some very
questionable meat at the restaurant.

08:43.746 --> 08:46.616
-Go take the test, see if we're okay.
-Okay.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.999
Tough crib.

08:56.171 --> 09:00.305
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
There's only one here.

09:02.517 --> 09:06.890
l might have checked to see
if l was ovulating a couple times.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.326
l'm not working! There's not much
to do around here!

09:34.013 --> 09:37.612
Sorry. You want a roll with that?

09:38.121 --> 09:40.216
Excuse me.

09:40.392 --> 09:43.729
ls there a woman waiting at the bar?

09:43.900 --> 09:48.604
Someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?

09:48.809 --> 09:51.781
There's a drunk Chinese guy.

09:52.918 --> 09:56.413
Well, if l'm still here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.

09:57.159 --> 09:58.856
Can l get you another glass of wine?

09:59.063 --> 10:02.503
l don't know if l should.
l don't want to be drunk when l...

10:02.671 --> 10:04.937
...go home alone tonight.

10:06.010 --> 10:10.178
-Got stood up, huh?
-lt's no big deal. lt's just a blind date.

10:10.385 --> 10:14.018
Are you worried your date came,
saw you and left?

10:15.095 --> 10:17.497
No!

10:20.640 --> 10:22.701
We're okay. l'm still ovulating.

10:22.911 --> 10:27.477
Oh, good, because as of 4:00
this afternoon, l am not.

10:28.656 --> 10:31.354
So let's do this.

10:31.562 --> 10:33.998
-l don't think l can.
-Oh, come on.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.901
l know you're not 1 <i>8</i> anymore,
but give it a minute.

10:39.043 --> 10:42.243
-Because of Emma.
-Oh, my God, Emma.

10:42.416 --> 10:45.252
Oh, sweetie, l forgot you were here.

10:45.422 --> 10:48.394
You're right, we can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.

10:48.562 --> 10:50.394
Sorry.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.529
Unless...

10:52.704 --> 10:55.038
...maybe we do it here.

10:55.208 --> 10:58.203
l mean, how much can she even
be aware of at this age?

10:58.415 --> 11:02.446
She's aware when we leave a room.
She may notice if we start...

11:02.624 --> 11:04.594
...canoodling in it.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.660
-Canoodling?
-Well, l can't say hump or screw...

11:08.836 --> 11:10.931
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.

11:12.811 --> 11:15.578
l don't know,
l guess having sex in front of a baby...

11:15.750 --> 11:18.916
-...isn't so....
-Horrifying? Scarring?

11:19.090 --> 11:21.721
Something people go to jail for?

11:23.733 --> 11:25.463
-l guess you're right.
-You guess?

11:25.636 --> 11:27.936
At that bed-and-breakfast,
we didn't have sex...

11:28.108 --> 11:31.137
...because you thought a deer
was staring through the window.

11:31.314 --> 11:35.152
Well, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?

11:41.300 --> 11:45.035
Wow, everything looks so good.

11:45.208 --> 11:48.180
l think l'm gonna have the chicken.

11:50.787 --> 11:53.485
l just have to say this.

11:53.659 --> 11:58.931
-You're really beautiful.
-Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.

12:00.071 --> 12:02.303
l'm kind of funny-looking.

12:04.079 --> 12:06.106
-What?
-Look, l mean, come on...

12:06.350 --> 12:10.222
...you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.

12:10.392 --> 12:12.693
l bet that guy over there
is probably saying:

12:12.864 --> 12:15.631
''Why's she out with him?
He must be rich.''

12:17.540 --> 12:19.635
Well, l'm not.

12:20.913 --> 12:22.940
Okay.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.419
Well, l guess, then the joke's on him.

12:28.127 --> 12:31.658
What do you think you want to order?
l'm real excited about that chicken.

12:31.869 --> 12:35.000
l'm not funny, either.

12:35.175 --> 12:38.409
So if you were thinking,
''Well, he's not that good-looking...

12:38.582 --> 12:42.784
...but maybe we'll have some laughs,''
that ain't gonna happen.

12:44.026 --> 12:48.695
Well, come on, Steve,
let's not rule out nervous laughter.

12:50.740 --> 12:53.837
So, now, l think that we should order...

12:54.013 --> 12:58.010
...and then eat, and then leave.

13:00.125 --> 13:03.063
l have a lot of medical problems.

13:05.235 --> 13:08.002
Hey, now, wait a minute,
Phoebe told me...

13:08.174 --> 13:11.271
...that you owned your own restaurant.
That's impressive.

13:11.447 --> 13:15.718
l lost it to drugs.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.461
l silk-screen T-shirts now.

13:22.670 --> 13:26.200
Really? What's that like?

13:26.410 --> 13:30.282
lt's really fulfilling doing something
you hate for no money.

13:31.588 --> 13:35.322
That's right. l have no money,
l'm not funny...

13:35.495 --> 13:40.996
...l live in a studio apartment
with two other guys.

13:41.173 --> 13:45.911
And l'm pretty sure l'm infertile.

13:49.691 --> 13:51.718
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

13:51.895 --> 13:55.334
There must be something
that you like about yourself.

13:56.972 --> 13:59.135
l do like my hair.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.783
Really?

14:13.639 --> 14:16.371
-Hello?
-Phoebe, it's me!

14:16.945 --> 14:20.851
l'm going to hunt you down
and kill you.

14:22.724 --> 14:25.194
Hey, Rach!

14:25.563 --> 14:29.526
This is the worst date ever! How could
you set me up with this creep?

14:29.738 --> 14:32.869
You know, you are talking about
one of my dear, dear friends.

14:33.077 --> 14:35.947
l don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

14:36.150 --> 14:38.815
All right, so he gets a little crazy
when he's stoned.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.098
-He's not stoned.
-Did he go out for a cigarette?

14:44.734 --> 14:47.604
-Yeah. Four times.
-My dear, sweet Rach.

14:49.744 --> 14:54.378
Well, our plan is working.
Rachel's having a miserable time...

14:54.587 --> 14:57.582
...and Ross is stood up somewhere
at a restaurant all alone.

14:57.794 --> 14:59.787
Pretty soon they'll be back together.

15:00.031 --> 15:04.996
By the time anyone's figured out what
we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.

15:06.277 --> 15:09.808
Oh, wait, that's the end
of a different plan.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.016
She's asleep. Chandler?

15:16.798 --> 15:19.428
-What are you doing?
-Emma was doing it.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.440
She's asleep.

15:24.012 --> 15:27.314
-She's asleep. That means we can....
-Yes. But we have to be fast.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.218
Oh, okay, l'll try.

15:30.425 --> 15:33.626
-And you can't make any noise.
-Okay, l'll try.

15:40.779 --> 15:43.045
Hello?

15:44.787 --> 15:47.053
Emma?

15:48.762 --> 15:51.962
Hey! Hi!

15:53.304 --> 15:56.037
How are you? How are you?

15:56.210 --> 15:59.307
Where are your babysitters, huh?

15:59.617 --> 16:02.817
Why is the bedroom door closed?

16:08.367 --> 16:13.868
You can't have S-E-X
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.

16:18.989 --> 16:23.362
l've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.

16:25.001 --> 16:27.905
lf it was meant to be, it's meant to be.

16:28.140 --> 16:29.939
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?

16:30.144 --> 16:33.048
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.

16:33.217 --> 16:36.918
ln fact, let me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.

16:37.459 --> 16:40.899
Wow, free crab cakes?
Well, that's nice.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.302
Although l was hoping
to have sex tonight.

16:50.919 --> 16:53.446
Just the crab cakes.

16:53.625 --> 16:57.120
What are you doing? Are you trying
to get him to stay? You can't do that.

16:57.298 --> 17:01.136
-Just get out of here, okay?
-l'm sorry, what's going on?

17:01.641 --> 17:04.807
Okay, the waiters have
a little pool going.

17:04.981 --> 17:09.582
We have a bet on how long it'll take
before you give up and go home.

17:11.093 --> 17:13.495
What?!

17:13.665 --> 17:16.796
You're making money off my misery?

17:17.005 --> 17:19.670
Well, if you stay till 9:20, l am.

17:19.877 --> 17:24.443
This is unbelievable. l have never
been so insulted in my life.

17:24.620 --> 17:28.457
Now, if you'll wrap up my free
crab cakes, l'll be on my way.

17:31.467 --> 17:35.636
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and l was fast.

17:35.809 --> 17:38.336
l think we may have
really done it this time.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.544
l wish l didn't have to wait
to take a pregnancy test.

17:41.721 --> 17:44.021
You may want to get
some more of those too.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.064
Where's Emma?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.865
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
Where's Emma?

17:51.073 --> 17:54.513
Don't ask me.
l was in there canoodling you.

17:55.381 --> 17:58.877
Okay. Okay. l'm sure that Rachel
came home early and picked up Emma.

17:59.055 --> 18:02.084
You go look across the hall,
and l'll call her cell.

18:02.328 --> 18:03.763
You better hope we're pregnant...

18:03.932 --> 18:07.895
...because one way or another,
we're giving a baby back to Rachel!

18:10.411 --> 18:13.315
l can't believe l'm crying
in front of you.

18:13.484 --> 18:15.785
You must think l'm so pathetic.

18:16.256 --> 18:19.160
No, no, no, l admire a man
who can cry.

18:19.362 --> 18:22.767
-Really?
-Don't touch my coat.

18:24.272 --> 18:26.675
Sorry, that's my phone.

18:26.878 --> 18:29.280
-Hello?
-Hey, Rach, how's it going?

18:29.482 --> 18:32.420
Oh, my God,
this is the worst date ever.

18:33.390 --> 18:35.793
Oh, come on.

18:35.963 --> 18:40.097
Look, you know what, l'm sorry, but did
you really think that this was going well?

18:42.910 --> 18:45.380
-What's up?
-Hey, did you stop by here?

18:45.549 --> 18:49.113
-<i>No.</i>
-Oh, my God! Then....

18:50.659 --> 18:52.561
Thank God! Emma, there you are!

18:55.234 --> 18:58.035
What? What do you mean,
''there you are''? Where was she?

18:58.508 --> 19:03.883
We were playing peekaboo.
She loves it when l'm dramatic.

19:07.492 --> 19:11.398
-Why the hell did you take her?
-Because you two were having sex!

19:13.470 --> 19:16.773
-No, we weren't.
-Don't you lie to me.

19:16.978 --> 19:21.180
l can tell by Chandler's hair. You are
so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

19:26.430 --> 19:28.263
All right. All right, we were.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.099
We're trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.

19:31.273 --> 19:34.006
Which is more than l can say for myself
as of 2:00 today.

19:37.619 --> 19:39.451
Guys!

19:40.358 --> 19:43.854
Seriously, those sticks
are expensive!

19:44.032 --> 19:47.870
lt's unacceptable that you'd have sex
with Emma in the next room.

19:48.073 --> 19:51.672
-l'll have to tell Rachel about this.
-Please don't. She will kill us.

19:51.848 --> 19:54.649
Hey, l gotta. Unless....

19:54.854 --> 19:56.345
Unless what?

19:56.524 --> 19:59.359
Unless you name
your first-born child Joey.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.194
-What? Why?
-Hey, l may never have kids...

20:04.372 --> 20:06.866
...and somebody's gotta
carry on my family name.

20:08.681 --> 20:11.413
Your family name is Tribbiani.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.501
You almost had me.

20:28.153 --> 20:29.679
Look...

20:29.957 --> 20:33.088
...l think l know the answer
to this question, but...

20:34.700 --> 20:36.966
...would you like to make love to me?

20:42.683 --> 20:45.587
Really, really not.

20:46.591 --> 20:48.618
lt's just as well.

20:48.795 --> 20:51.265
lt doesn't work anyway.

20:59.583 --> 21:03.215
All right, well, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.

21:13.043 --> 21:15.947
-Hey, what's wrong?
-l just had a rough night.

21:16.551 --> 21:18.281
Crab cake?

21:20.024 --> 21:21.789
Well, what happened?

21:21.994 --> 21:24.727
This is kind of weird
to talk to you about this, but--

21:24.900 --> 21:26.995
Monica told me you had a blind date.

21:27.171 --> 21:30.041
-Yeah.
-l did too.

21:30.210 --> 21:34.412
But is it technically a date
if the other person doesn't show up?

21:35.989 --> 21:39.793
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,
saw you and left?

21:43.337 --> 21:45.740
Why does everyone keep saying that?

21:46.577 --> 21:50.016
lf it makes you feel any better,
l wish my date hadn't shown up.

21:50.217 --> 21:53.121
-That bad?
-Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

21:53.323 --> 21:56.888
...and he thought it would be
appropriate to give me...

21:57.633 --> 21:59.124
...this.

22:00.939 --> 22:03.775
''Female Body lnspector''?

22:04.847 --> 22:07.443
What size is that?

22:08.721 --> 22:12.319
Now wait a minute. So they're gonna
name their first child Joey?

22:12.495 --> 22:15.228
How do l get them to name
the next one after me?

22:15.401 --> 22:18.396
lt's easy. You just
walk in on them having sex.

22:19.375 --> 22:22.576
Oh, so they owe me,
like, three Phoebes.

22:23.383 --> 22:26.253
Oh, my God!
Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

22:26.456 --> 22:28.119
The plan is working!

22:29.429 --> 22:32.026
Don't do the plan laugh.

22:33.103 --> 22:37.168
The first dates we've had in months,
and they were both such disasters.

22:39.348 --> 22:41.284
You know, it is weird...

22:41.453 --> 22:45.895
...that Phoebe would set me up
on a date that was awful...

22:46.062 --> 22:50.663
...on the same night Joey set you up
on a date that didn't even show.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.908
Wait a minute.

22:54.078 --> 22:57.050
You don't think it was intentional?

22:57.218 --> 22:59.746
l mean, that's just stupid.

22:59.990 --> 23:02.085
We're geniuses.

23:03.196 --> 23:08.195
-Look at them! They're really bonding.
-They're falling in love all over again.

23:10.010 --> 23:12.573
Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.

23:14.485 --> 23:16.752
They figured it out.
They're coming. Run!

23:16.924 --> 23:19.053
-Where?
-Mexico!

23:24.338 --> 23:27.401
Can you believe they're still not here?

23:27.579 --> 23:30.949
l know. A double blind date
and we both get stood up.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.316
What are the chances?

23:34.125 --> 23:36.596
l know, l'm so bummed.

23:36.764 --> 23:39.132
Could we have
our free crab cakes now?

23:40.805 --> 23:43.675
-What?
-We've been stood up.

23:43.845 --> 23:46.840
And we want our free crab cakes.

23:47.017 --> 23:51.959
-You were stood up here last night.
-l know. lt hurts.

23:52.127 --> 23:58.094
Being stood up two nights in a row
has left a crab cake sized hole in my heart.

23:59.175 --> 24:01.772
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.

24:01.947 --> 24:06.320
Although we do have a pool going
to see how long it takes that guy to cry.

24:07.926 --> 24:10.659
l have such fat hands!

24:15.642 --> 24:18.614
l hate my dick!
