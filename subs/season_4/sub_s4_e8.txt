WEBVTT

00:05.071 --> 00:07.733
It's me. I know you
can 't stand to see me.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.500
I'm trying to apologize
over the phone

00:19.052 --> 00:21.987
I shouldn't have kissed
your girlfriend

00:25.859 --> 00:27.019
Stop calling!

00:27.227 --> 00:31.357
This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...

00:31.564 --> 00:34.089
...calling with our $ 1000
daily challenge!

00:34.401 --> 00:35.561
All right!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.895
What is the name of...

00:37.170 --> 00:41.334
...your roommate who is very sorry
and would do anything?

00:46.946 --> 00:50.382
-Damn it, Chandler, stop calling.
-Joey, it's Ross.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.709
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

00:51.851 --> 00:52.943
What's up?

00:53.086 --> 00:59.047
Not much. I got Chandler
here and he's really, really sorry

00:59.659 --> 01:01.684
The One with Chandler in a Box

01:46.139 --> 01:48.039
Oh, turkey!

01:48.308 --> 01:50.970
Giving thanks!

01:51.878 --> 01:54.745
Look, everyone.
It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

01:55.648 --> 01:57.206
Are things with Joey better?

01:57.450 --> 02:00.180
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

02:00.420 --> 02:02.320
...trying to get him
to talk to me.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.115
Eight hours.

02:05.358 --> 02:09.089
You could probably use
a plug-in telephone headset.

02:09.329 --> 02:13.663
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that are stolen from your office?

02:16.269 --> 02:17.361
You shouldn't.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.533
Speaking of Christmas....

02:20.773 --> 02:24.675
Since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have no money...

02:24.944 --> 02:29.540
...this year we could do Secret Santa
and each only buy one gift.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.013
And there's the added mystery
of who gets who.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.285
Who gets whom.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.516
I don't know why I do that.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.992
But it is correct.

02:45.131 --> 02:48.191
Hey, what's this?
It's all of your names.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.461
Let's pick.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.066
Hey, what's going?

02:55.909 --> 03:00.039
-No, Joey, stay.
-We're picking names for Secret Santa.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.181
Okay.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.448
I invented Secret Santa, you know.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.787
What are you laughing at? You're the
one who said Die Hard was your idea.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.187
It was.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.361
Don't make me show you the napkin.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.563
I'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.633
We haven't eaten yet.

03:29.342 --> 03:33.745
I know, but all that work
you're doing to get it ready and....

03:35.515 --> 03:39.315
Did you pick Rachel for your
Secret Santa? I'll trade for her.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.086
I picked her.
Thank God, you want her!

03:43.423 --> 03:45.721
Why do you want to get
rid of her so badly?

03:45.925 --> 03:47.859
She exchanges every gift she gets.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.494
It's impossible to get her
something she likes.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.221
Come on, let's trade!

03:52.498 --> 03:55.194
I got her that backpack
and she loved it.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.268
I remember she cried
when that big dog ran off with

04:01.441 --> 04:03.238
There was no big dog.

04:04.544 --> 04:09.277
This sucks! I already got her
a briefcase with "R.G." put on it.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.047
Her initials.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.411
Okay, I'm really bad at initials.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.953
You got your shopping done early.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.721
Yeah, well, my Camel Cash
was about to expire.

04:23.162 --> 04:26.188
Maybe you can give it to somebody
else. Like Ross Geller!

04:27.033 --> 04:29.365
You know what?
It's a girlie briefcase.

04:29.836 --> 04:33.101
Who cares!
He works in a museum.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.635
The big game's about to start!

04:36.843 --> 04:40.006
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.

04:40.179 --> 04:41.908
Thanks.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.075
What is wrong with this freezer?

04:46.753 --> 04:49.153
-What happened?
-lce just got in my eye!

04:49.789 --> 04:52.815
People are trying
to sleep in here!

04:53.092 --> 04:54.957
Monica got ice in her eye
and it hurts!

04:55.228 --> 04:58.129
-Open it up. Let me see.
-I can't. It really kills.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.958
Maybe you should put
some ice on it.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.497
-lt looks bad.
-We should take you to a doctor.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.567
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

05:07.840 --> 05:10.638
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.543
He's really picky about his patients.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.704
You've got to go.
What's his office number?

05:17.183 --> 05:19.583
Like I remember his office number!

05:19.786 --> 05:21.276
Speed dial seven.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.925
I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.023
Is Richard Burke in today?

05:31.698 --> 05:33.962
He's not in. Will she
see the on-call doctor?

05:34.200 --> 05:37.465
-Yes.
-She's very excited about that!

05:38.204 --> 05:40.035
Okay, we'll be right in.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.141
Okay, so who's gonna take her in?

05:42.308 --> 05:45.300
I'll go, you can watch your parade.

05:49.482 --> 05:53.680
It's so cool.
Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.411
And I get to make all the decisions.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.257
She told you to follow
the recipe exactly.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.221
Get out of my kitchen.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.899
I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.660
When I walked in,
he went to his bedroom...

06:09.902 --> 06:12.871
...but he only slammed the door once.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.803
Yeah, he gave me the finger
while doing it.

06:16.843 --> 06:21.303
I've got to call my mom and
ask her a left-handed cooking question.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.246
I'm gonna be in there.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.782
While I'm gone....

06:31.290 --> 06:34.020
Chandler, you're in charge.

06:36.462 --> 06:40.455
I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but
I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.394
You want to switch?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.200
I was trying to trade...

06:45.438 --> 06:46.462
...for you.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.742
Really? That's so nice.
What are you getting me?

06:51.944 --> 06:56.745
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.481
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

07:00.753 --> 07:05.053
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.124
No, I got her lots of stuff
she never took back.

07:08.394 --> 07:09.383
Like?

07:09.595 --> 07:12.120
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

07:12.331 --> 07:13.730
When did she wear it last?

07:14.233 --> 07:18.169
She wore it all Christmas day
and then....

07:19.305 --> 07:20.431
Big dog?

07:27.513 --> 07:28.571
What are you doing?

07:28.781 --> 07:31.306
Sending back this stuff
Chandler bought.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.613
-Even the TV?
-No, I'll put that in my room.

07:37.356 --> 07:41.452
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.423
But can't you hear him out?

07:44.030 --> 07:47.659
If Chandler had kissed Rachel,
would you hear him out?

07:48.601 --> 07:50.125
That's a good point.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.502
How long you going to punish him?

07:53.739 --> 07:55.297
Five years.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.498
You've sentenced him?

07:57.910 --> 08:00.743
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.908
The guy's your best friend.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.013
Was my best friend.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.186
I don't know why
you're pushing for him.

08:07.487 --> 08:12.049
With him out of the way as
my best friend, there's a spot open.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.951
-Who, me?
-Yeah.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.932
I'm honored. You know what
I'm going to do as your best friend?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.700
I'm going to get you
to talk to Chandler.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.029
All right.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.937
But if you weren't
my best friend....

08:32.178 --> 08:34.578
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.042
I walk in the room,
and he won't talk to me.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.219
He just mumbles something in ltalian.

08:41.387 --> 08:44.117
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.587
I'm so, so sorry.
I feel responsible.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.890
It's not your fault.

08:54.600 --> 08:59.367
-Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
-I thought you were Chandler.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.071
But one of you is over there.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.749
Hey, Joe.

09:23.462 --> 09:26.761
I'll be right with you.
Thanks for coming in.

09:27.833 --> 09:31.963
Oh, my God!
How cute is the on-call doctor?

09:32.471 --> 09:36.339
So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

09:45.251 --> 09:49.984
-You have the best luck with eye doctors.
-I know.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.022
Dr. Burke will see you now.

09:53.225 --> 09:56.922
Not Dr. Burke.
The on-call doctor will see me now.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.592
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

09:58.864 --> 10:02.095
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.431
Ready?

10:12.311 --> 10:14.302
Hey, I'm sorry. That

10:15.781 --> 10:18.477
-Where you going?
-My folks'.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.977
When you coming back?

10:22.221 --> 10:26.658
I don't know. I might stay there
while I look for an apartment.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.649
What?

10:29.195 --> 10:33.529
I thought we could talk
about this. Work it out.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.724
Seeing you two together, I don't....

10:36.002 --> 10:39.233
What do you want me to say?
Should I stop seeing her?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.963
It's not about her. Okay?

10:42.241 --> 10:45.677
But seeing you together
reminds me of what you did.

10:45.978 --> 10:50.472
I won't live with someone who doesn't
know what it is to be a friend.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.811
I know what it is to be a friend.
I screwed up.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.544
Yeah, you did.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.547
And that's why I'm leaving.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.987
If you're not going to stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.895
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.330
And that chick used to be very cute.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.064
When that guy was robbing us...

11:15.274 --> 11:18.107
...and I was locked in the
entertainment unit for six hours...

11:18.244 --> 11:19.905
...do you know what I was doing?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.670
I was thinking about
how I let you down.

11:24.617 --> 11:29.179
If I knew what kind of friend
you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.

11:30.756 --> 11:34.453
Wait one second! There has
to be something that I can do.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.059
If we still had that unit...

11:36.262 --> 11:40.995
...I'd get in it for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.694
What?

11:47.440 --> 11:48.600
We got a box.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.976
I remember the last time I saw you.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.511
It was the morning I left for college.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.818
You were standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

12:02.021 --> 12:04.717
Just probably waiting for it to open.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.183
-You look great now.
-You look great too.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.653
You're an excellent patient.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.721
How does it look?

12:13.966 --> 12:18.062
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.065
Like a pirate?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.535
If that helps you.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.848
How long have you been working
with your dad?

12:30.916 --> 12:33.146
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.477
I moved back here a couple months ago.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.990
Big family dinner tonight?

12:41.093 --> 12:42.720
No way!

12:42.928 --> 12:45.556
I was gonna have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.389
But we broke up.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.599
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

12:55.174 --> 12:58.143
So you made her walk the plank,
aye, matey?

12:59.311 --> 13:00.835
You're not wearing the patch yet.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.943
I know.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.649
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
-I know. It's sick.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.689
-Why is it sick?
-It's Richard's son!

13:17.897 --> 13:21.799
It's like inviting
a Greek tragedy over for dinner.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.499
If it were Greek,
I'd be blind in both eyes.

13:26.005 --> 13:30.942
I like him because he's handsome and
he's nice and smart and handsome.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.046
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

13:35.247 --> 13:38.410
I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.147
Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.151
-What's twisted?
-Me going out with Richard's son.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.155
It sounds like a really bad idea to me.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.835
-ls he okay in there?
-He's fine!

14:00.439 --> 14:03.237
If things work out
between you and Richard's son...

14:03.442 --> 14:05.069
...you can tell your kids...

14:05.277 --> 14:07.768
...that you slept
with their grandfather.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.013
Judge all you want to.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.581
Married a lesbian,
left a man at the altar...

14:13.853 --> 14:15.320
...Ioved a gay ice dancer...

14:15.487 --> 14:18.581
...threw a girl's wooden leg
in the fire, live in a box!

14:25.564 --> 14:28.624
What exactly is the point of the box?

14:31.403 --> 14:33.997
The meaning of the box is threefold.

14:34.573 --> 14:38.634
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

14:39.011 --> 14:43.778
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.940
And three...

14:47.086 --> 14:49.281
...it hurts.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.883
And if he stays in the box
you guys will be friends again?

14:53.259 --> 14:55.853
Let's just say it's a start.

14:56.328 --> 15:00.492
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

15:00.666 --> 15:02.327
Can I see it?

15:03.102 --> 15:04.399
Why?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.932
I just want to check something.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.840
Okay.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.577
Now we'll see.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.303
Air hole! Air hole!

15:18.150 --> 15:21.313
Here it is. I love it.
I wear it all the time.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.853
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.529
Well, maybe...

15:33.532 --> 15:34.931
...it changed.

15:35.801 --> 15:38.599
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.

15:38.837 --> 15:42.000
Isn't it better to exchange it
for something I enjoy...

15:42.207 --> 15:43.538
...and can use a lot?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.501
What did you get?

15:45.711 --> 15:47.338
Credit.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.418
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.384
Hi, Tim.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.087
Thank you.
Come meet my friends.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.987
Phoebe.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.492
And Joey.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.324
My brother, Ross.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.158
And Rachel.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.605
That's Chandler.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.307
How do you do?

16:18.243 --> 16:20.507
-What's?
-Well, he's....

16:20.746 --> 16:22.976
He's doing some thinking.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.480
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend!

16:36.161 --> 16:37.423
I like those sunglasses.

16:37.997 --> 16:43.128
"Like them" like them? Or "I'd like
to get store credit" like them?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.935
This turkey is ready.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.107
Where can I wash up?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.142
Let me show you.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.378
The towels are hanging next
to the sink.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.618
-And you can use the fancy soap.
-Thank you.

17:02.821 --> 17:06.450
Fancy soap? I thought we were
saving that for the pope.

17:07.826 --> 17:09.555
See. He's nice, right?

17:09.795 --> 17:12.923
Do you want a relationship
where you can actually say:

17:13.165 --> 17:15.827
"That's not how your dad
used to do it"?

17:20.472 --> 17:23.134
Everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

17:23.342 --> 17:24.331
Saved you a seat.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.309
Sick, sick, sick, sick.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.105
I'll get it.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.111
Got you!

17:35.621 --> 17:38.112
That doesn't sound
like thinking to me.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.926
-Sorry!
-You shouldn't be talking at all.

17:42.127 --> 17:45.290
You've got too much thinking to do
to be talking and joking.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.292
Okay, you got it!

17:47.499 --> 17:49.262
Ross, pass me the yams?

17:50.002 --> 17:54.098
Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.173
Will you stop!
What's the matter with you?

18:00.813 --> 18:03.043
We've got company.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.280
Nothing's the matter with me.

18:06.452 --> 18:10.445
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
I have feelings.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.486
Okay, fine.

18:19.031 --> 18:23.263
You can't tell, but I'm breaking
the tension by mooning you guys.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.803
All right, look!

18:31.143 --> 18:33.976
If this is a big joke to you,
forget about it.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.204
This means something to me.

18:36.415 --> 18:39.350
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.781
Otherwise, you're just
an idiot in a box.

18:42.387 --> 18:45.584
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

18:45.791 --> 18:50.125
I want to be friends again.
I swear I won't say another word.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.659
-So you'll take this seriously?
-Absolutely!

18:53.999 --> 18:56.229
That sounds like another word to me.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.500
Are you going to take this seriously?

19:03.509 --> 19:04.942
Okay!

19:07.012 --> 19:09.913
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.818
This is a movie stub
from our first date.

19:14.052 --> 19:17.988
This eggshell is from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

19:18.590 --> 19:22.720
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

19:22.995 --> 19:24.428
...were together.

19:25.330 --> 19:30.233
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.835
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

19:34.907 --> 19:38.900
Though you're not
supposed to take these.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.448
It's, like, a million years old.

19:45.450 --> 19:49.784
We actually have people
looking for that.

19:55.961 --> 19:59.021
-Mind if I smoke?
-Care if I die?

19:59.164 --> 20:02.930
No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
Go ahead, smoke.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.626
This always happens.

20:05.237 --> 20:06.670
Here, let me.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.729
Thank you.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.245
You have very beautiful...

20:15.080 --> 20:16.672
...eye.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.279
My friends think this is weird.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.319
Even the one in the box?

20:24.189 --> 20:25.349
It's not weird, is it?

20:26.058 --> 20:30.051
I thought it would be. I almost
canceled, but it really isn't.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.963
I know. Me and your dad,
that's totally separate.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.167
I totally agree.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.460
We're two people
who find each other...

20:39.838 --> 20:41.806
...very attractive.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.497
Right?

20:54.419 --> 20:57.479
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.519
No, really.
Was that not okay?

21:00.759 --> 21:02.021
No, that was good.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.752
That was a good kiss.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.161
-lt reminded you of
-Don't say it!

21:09.968 --> 21:11.993
-lt did, didn't it?
-Yes!

21:13.305 --> 21:14.533
I know!

21:17.342 --> 21:20.971
God, I am sorry. I am so sorry.

21:21.113 --> 21:26.141
It's okay. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without a little emotional scarring.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.078
You know what's even worse?

21:29.221 --> 21:30.745
My friends were right.

21:30.889 --> 21:36.850
You know what's worst for me is you remind
me of a younger version of my mom.

21:59.284 --> 22:02.811
-I want you to know how sorry I am
-It's okay.

22:03.021 --> 22:07.549
-Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
-Well, I'm still sorry.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.393
-ls he here?
-ln the box.

22:20.572 --> 22:23.063
He can't talk right now.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.432
Why not? What's going on?

22:25.811 --> 22:28.575
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.842
-By being in a box?
-Joey had reasons.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.816
They were threefold.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.687
You not being able to talk
might make this easier.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.831
Listen....

22:57.909 --> 23:02.846
I don't want to be someone
who comes between two best friends.

23:04.249 --> 23:07.844
I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

23:08.286 --> 23:11.050
And I don't want to be
the cause of that.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.555
I don't think we can see
each other anymore.

23:15.794 --> 23:18.126
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.964
I'm going to stay there for a while.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.768
I think this could have been
something really amazing.

23:29.975 --> 23:34.105
But, you know, this is
probably for the best.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.609
You know?

23:41.453 --> 23:43.216
I'm going to miss you.

23:46.324 --> 23:48.315
Goodbye, Chandler.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.962
Open the box!

24:00.839 --> 24:01.828
What?

24:01.973 --> 24:06.467
He can still catch her.
Get out of there! Get out of there!

24:08.713 --> 24:12.080
We're going to be fine.
Get out!

24:13.952 --> 24:16.386
You did some real good
thinking in there.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.820
I mean, this is....

24:23.562 --> 24:25.257
You could still catch her!

24:25.697 --> 24:28.359
And merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa!

24:32.137 --> 24:35.732
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.472
He sees her!

24:43.715 --> 24:46.240
He's catching up to her.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.877
She sees him!

24:49.588 --> 24:51.180
They're hugging!

24:53.225 --> 24:55.386
He's taking her purse.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.324
That's not them.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.361
I'll go call the police.

25:03.101 --> 25:05.001
There they are!

25:11.710 --> 25:13.735
All right, get a room.
