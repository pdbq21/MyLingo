WEBVTT

00:03.982 --> 00:06.314
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

00:06.518 --> 00:10.352
WeII, technicaIIy, it started
7 biIIion years ago.

00:10.989 --> 00:13.958
Okay. Fine, I'II stop.
No teaching, okay?

00:14.192 --> 00:17.992
We'II just watch the pretty Iight
streaking across the sky.

00:18.196 --> 00:19.663
Okay?

00:20.165 --> 00:24.534
Whose officiaI name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

00:26.204 --> 00:29.537
There it is. Oh, Iook at that!

00:29.741 --> 00:32.676
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

00:34.646 --> 00:36.204
That's a pIane.

00:37.215 --> 00:41.049
WeII, aII right, 1 700 bags
of peanuts fIying that high...

00:41.320 --> 00:43.049
...that's pretty amazing too.

00:45.257 --> 00:48.886
-I wonder if you can see my apartment.
-No, you can't.

00:50.128 --> 00:52.653
-What?
-I don't know.

00:54.399 --> 00:56.663
Man, Iook at aII those stars.

00:56.868 --> 01:02.033
Infinite space.
It reaIIy makes you wonder, doesn't it?

01:03.842 --> 01:06.140
-Know what eIse makes you wonder?
-What?

01:06.345 --> 01:08.939
Check out the rack on that chick.

01:13.085 --> 01:15.417
You think those babies are reaI?

01:19.558 --> 01:21.685
The One Where They're Up AII Night

01:57.596 --> 01:59.564
We've been out here for two hours...

01:59.798 --> 02:03.063
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

02:03.301 --> 02:06.566
I mean, ChandIer's getting chiIIy.

02:09.941 --> 02:11.806
No, I'm not.

02:13.245 --> 02:15.611
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

02:16.515 --> 02:19.075
Because it's fIattering!

02:20.552 --> 02:22.850
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

02:23.855 --> 02:27.416
-We're gonna take off too. Rented a movie.
-I won't say no to a movie.

02:27.626 --> 02:30.390
Oh, Pheebs, we just actuaIIy
wanted to be aIone.

02:30.595 --> 02:32.756
-Get me out of here.
-Oh, okay.

02:36.601 --> 02:37.625
-Hey, Ross.
-What?

02:37.869 --> 02:39.530
-Check this out.
-Is it the comet?

02:40.138 --> 02:43.835
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.101
I can't beIieve--

02:46.344 --> 02:48.835
I bring you here to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

02:49.047 --> 02:51.572
...one of nature's
most spectacuIar phenomena...

02:51.783 --> 02:56.345
...and aII you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

02:59.257 --> 03:01.919
You know, there's two women, dude.

03:03.428 --> 03:04.861
Show me where.

03:05.864 --> 03:07.764
Okay. Right up here.

03:13.739 --> 03:16.970
Joey, where's the pipe
that was hoIding the door open?

03:17.175 --> 03:18.437
I don't know.

03:26.618 --> 03:28.643
Yeah, I do.

03:31.456 --> 03:33.481
-Joey!
-What? Hey, don't Iook at me!

03:33.692 --> 03:38.459
You wanted to come up here and Iook
for some stupid Burger King comet.

03:39.531 --> 03:42.523
It's caIIed the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

03:42.801 --> 03:46.259
Hey, Bapstein was a very
weII-respected astronomer from--

03:46.671 --> 03:48.104
No!

03:58.150 --> 04:01.415
-Monica.
-She's sIeeping.

04:04.122 --> 04:06.488
I know. Just a <i>q</i>uick <i>q</i>uestion.

04:06.725 --> 04:11.025
Which one was <i>Deep Impact</i>
and which one was <i>Armageddon</i>?

04:13.799 --> 04:16.666
<i>Deep Impact</i> was the one
with Robert DuvaII.

04:16.868 --> 04:20.531
<i>Armageddon</i> is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

04:21.306 --> 04:24.798
Sorry, I just can't sIeep.

04:29.581 --> 04:33.745
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

04:33.985 --> 04:36.510
...and wearing those hats
with the fIowers on it.

04:36.721 --> 04:39.815
Because every time I Iook
at that cover, I'm Iike--

04:42.160 --> 04:45.186
It's in the Iiving room,
where there's aIso a Iight...

04:45.397 --> 04:47.558
...and no one wiII
kick you in the shin.

04:49.234 --> 04:50.462
What?

05:02.848 --> 05:06.079
PIease don't be a spaceship.
PIease don't be a spaceship.

05:13.992 --> 05:15.687
Oh, thank God.

05:49.728 --> 05:52.595
How couId you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

05:52.797 --> 05:56.961
I took out your battery! How can--?
Don't interrupt me!

05:58.103 --> 06:01.163
RacheI! Monica!

06:01.439 --> 06:03.031
Come on!

06:05.911 --> 06:08.141
I can't beIieve this!

06:08.413 --> 06:12.611
AII right, weII, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

06:12.817 --> 06:14.978
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

06:15.820 --> 06:19.085
HeIp us! PIease heIp us!

06:19.291 --> 06:23.489
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

06:25.196 --> 06:26.356
Ross.

06:27.799 --> 06:30.563
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

06:32.370 --> 06:34.429
I know. I wasn't finished.

06:37.475 --> 06:39.705
But don't worry!

06:40.312 --> 06:43.873
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

06:59.164 --> 07:03.464
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm miIk and it wouId heIp me sIeep.

07:03.668 --> 07:04.999
With a wok?

07:06.771 --> 07:09.399
Thought you were gonna read my book
to put you to sIeep?

07:09.641 --> 07:12.007
It got interesting.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.303
Damn you, Oprah!

07:15.413 --> 07:18.314
Here, Iet me make the miIk.
I'm up anyway.

07:18.516 --> 07:21.007
You know what we couId do
now that we're up?

07:21.219 --> 07:23.983
We couId just taIk
to each other aII night Iong.

07:24.189 --> 07:26.680
Like we did when we were first going out.
It'd be fun.

07:27.025 --> 07:28.720
-Okay, that does sound fun.
-Yeah.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.427
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

07:32.664 --> 07:34.564
The second sister dies?!

07:39.537 --> 07:40.902
No.

07:42.807 --> 07:45.742
No, I was taIking
about the book I was reading.

07:45.944 --> 07:50.040
The second sister dies in
<i>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</i>?

07:52.217 --> 07:53.377
That's correct.

08:00.025 --> 08:02.858
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's a IittIe more comfortabIe.

08:03.094 --> 08:04.789
-Sure.
-Okay.

08:06.331 --> 08:09.664
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to MiIan?

08:10.835 --> 08:13.531
If this is your idea of se<i>x</i>y taIk....

08:14.506 --> 08:17.066
Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

08:17.242 --> 08:18.231
What contracts?

08:18.410 --> 08:22.278
PIease teII me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.606
Like what?

08:23.815 --> 08:26.875
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

08:28.653 --> 08:30.883
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

08:31.122 --> 08:33.682
Those contracts had to go out today.

08:33.892 --> 08:35.883
You didn't give me any contracts.

08:36.127 --> 08:39.187
Yes, I did. I put a IittIe
Post-it on it that said:

08:39.397 --> 08:43.265
''Must go out today,'' and I
underIined ''today'' three times.

08:43.468 --> 08:47.962
Then I put a IittIe heart in the corner
because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.

08:48.473 --> 08:50.304
You never gave them to me.

08:50.508 --> 08:55.207
If we went to the office, you wouId see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

08:55.413 --> 08:59.474
No, I'd see you Iooking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

08:59.684 --> 09:04.383
Maybe I'd Iook embarrassed because you're
taIking on the phone with your crotch.

09:05.423 --> 09:07.482
You want to go to the office now?

09:07.692 --> 09:10.889
Come on, it's Iate.
We're not going down to the office.

09:11.096 --> 09:14.896
Yeah, I understand. I wouIdn't
want to be proved wrong either.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.361
AII right, get your coat!

09:18.570 --> 09:22.597
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

09:30.748 --> 09:33.615
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

09:34.719 --> 09:36.346
We're just gonna have to jump.

09:38.256 --> 09:40.918
Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to Iand...

09:41.192 --> 09:44.525
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

09:44.762 --> 09:48.425
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

09:49.067 --> 09:54.471
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middIe.

09:55.707 --> 09:58.232
So when you get down there...

10:00.211 --> 10:05.114
...you go up to the roof
and you Iet me in.

10:05.717 --> 10:08.709
-Wait a minute. I have to do it?
-You'II be fine.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.582
It'II be just Iike
bungee jumping, you know?

10:11.789 --> 10:15.953
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

10:18.496 --> 10:21.397
WeII, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

10:21.599 --> 10:25.126
WeII, I'm not gonna Iie to you, Joey.
It's a possibiIity.

10:28.273 --> 10:31.765
I don't know. TeII you what,
Iet's fIip to see who does it.

10:31.976 --> 10:34.945
-You caII it in the air, aII right?
-Oh, aII right.

10:39.150 --> 10:42.483
-Can you see what it is?
-No.

10:42.687 --> 10:45.986
-Okay. WeII, you be carefuI.
-No, Ross, stop it.

10:46.257 --> 10:47.315
I'm not jumping.

10:47.525 --> 10:51.655
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my Ieg.

10:51.896 --> 10:56.492
WeII, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

10:56.701 --> 10:58.601
So it Iooks Iike we're even.

11:03.908 --> 11:06.638
Okay, so this wire...

11:06.945 --> 11:10.813
...is connected to this wire,
which pIugs into here.

11:11.482 --> 11:15.612
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
aII I have to do....

11:27.165 --> 11:28.962
WeII done, Pheebs.

11:33.171 --> 11:36.663
What do you want from me?!

11:40.645 --> 11:43.170
Here's your miIk.
What do you wanna taIk about?

11:46.317 --> 11:48.046
What? What? What?

11:48.253 --> 11:52.713
Oh, were you sIeeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

12:11.843 --> 12:13.834
<i>Oh, that's so much better. Okay.</i>

12:14.012 --> 12:17.038
<i>At least I can hear myself think.</i>

12:33.431 --> 12:35.194
<i>God, stop singing.</i>

12:35.366 --> 12:37.163
<i>Stop singing!</i>

12:47.612 --> 12:49.102
Okay. FeeI free to Iook...

12:49.380 --> 12:52.213
...but I'm teIIing you,
those contracts are not on this desk.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.011
How couId you possibIy know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

12:55.219 --> 12:58.382
This is what I'm taIking about.
You have to be more organized.

12:58.589 --> 13:02.548
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you-- Oh!

13:03.027 --> 13:05.495
And who's this chippy?

13:06.197 --> 13:08.358
A IittIe young for you, but whatever.

13:08.566 --> 13:09.692
That's my sister.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.535
ReaIIy? Very cute braces.

13:14.439 --> 13:17.636
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start Iooking...

13:17.875 --> 13:21.106
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

13:22.947 --> 13:26.747
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

13:26.951 --> 13:31.115
In the afternoon. Mr. ZeIner
came into my office after Iunch...

13:31.322 --> 13:34.780
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

13:36.828 --> 13:37.886
...that said:

13:38.629 --> 13:41.120
''Must go out today.''

13:43.101 --> 13:45.968
So you just keep Iooking
in there, aII right?

13:55.847 --> 13:57.212
They're not here.

13:58.483 --> 13:59.916
PuzzIer.

14:03.488 --> 14:05.115
Bit of a puzzIe.

14:05.590 --> 14:09.356
Why don't you check the copy room.
Maybe you Ieft the contracts in there.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.427
-How couId I have Ieft them there?
-I don't know.

14:12.630 --> 14:15.098
How can your genitaIs
make phone caIIs?

14:16.234 --> 14:19.601
Okay? It's not a perfect worId.
Just go, pIease?

14:20.538 --> 14:22.438
-Fine.
-Thank you.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.247
HeIIo?

14:41.592 --> 14:42.923
I stiII don't get it.

14:47.665 --> 14:49.326
You stiII awake?

14:49.767 --> 14:51.564
Yeah. You?

14:52.637 --> 14:55.606
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

14:59.777 --> 15:01.074
Hey.

15:01.312 --> 15:03.109
As Iong as we're both up....

15:04.415 --> 15:05.780
Yeah?

15:08.319 --> 15:11.948
I hope you're not thinking
about cIeaning the Iiving room.

15:16.461 --> 15:20.192
Man, I'm starving. What the heII
was I thinking at dinner?

15:20.431 --> 15:23.958
''Do you want soup or saIad?''
Both, aIways order both.

15:26.137 --> 15:30.301
You know, I'm Iooking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

15:30.508 --> 15:33.170
I say we just break the window...

15:33.377 --> 15:34.639
...crawI through...

15:34.846 --> 15:37.212
...and you know, e<i>x</i>pIain Iater.

15:37.448 --> 15:39.313
-No one's home?
-I don't think so.

15:39.517 --> 15:40.643
HeIIo?

15:47.358 --> 15:50.225
So when you get in there....

15:57.301 --> 16:01.499
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

16:01.739 --> 16:02.967
Noisy bitch!

16:07.812 --> 16:10.508
Oh, what? What are you doing?

16:10.982 --> 16:13.177
Do you know what just happened?

16:14.385 --> 16:18.185
Yeah. We had se<i>x</i>,
and then we feII asIeep.

-I wish you wouId.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.264

How about that drawer?

17:47.612 --> 17:51.605
WeII, it's not out here.

...crawIed across the fIoor,
then jumped onto my desk?

18:35.559 --> 18:38.323
How did you know

18:42.867 --> 18:45.131
I am so hot for you right now.

18:58.082 --> 19:01.848
Oh, my God!

Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.

19:19.437 --> 19:21.200
-That's not mine.
-Yes, it is.

19:21.472 --> 19:24.407
-How do you know?
-Ne<i>x</i>t time you dump a fire aIarm...

19:24.575 --> 19:28.671
...don't use a bIanket that says,
''Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica.''

19:29.680 --> 19:31.375
Do you have a search warrant?

19:31.582 --> 19:35.040
Because the Iast time I checked,
this was stiII America.

19:36.187 --> 19:39.179
PIease reattach it.
It's iIIegaI to disconnect them.

19:39.390 --> 19:43.451
Fine. But pIease, God, teII me
how to stop it from going off?

19:43.694 --> 19:45.252
Press the reset button.

19:45.463 --> 19:49.092
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

19:49.333 --> 19:52.200

-Yeah.

20:31.842 --> 20:34.675

I prefer not to answer. I'm stiII
carrying a IittIe hoIiday weight.

21:16.053 --> 21:18.317
When we taIked about face to face...

21:18.522 --> 21:21.389
...I don't think we thought it
aII the way through.

21:22.026 --> 21:25.860
-What do you want me to do?
-Just shimmy down me and drop.

21:31.135 --> 21:32.659

21:43.280 --> 21:46.943
-It stiII Iooks pretty far.
-It's not that far. Just drop.

21:47.184 --> 21:48.913
Do not rush me!

21:56.927 --> 22:01.694
My pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

22:07.271 --> 22:09.762
My ankIe! I reaIIy hurt my ankIe!

A <i>q</i>uarter!

22:27.291 --> 22:28.451

22:33.264 --> 22:35.289
