WEBVTT

00:03.257 --> 00:06.658
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace...

00:06.894 --> 00:08.327
...called Sample?

00:08.529 --> 00:12.431
And as you're driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

00:12.700 --> 00:14.759
"You're in Sample."

00:19.006 --> 00:20.997
- How did it go with Pete?
- Tell us.

00:21.209 --> 00:23.507
You're not gonna believe this.
So I go...

00:23.744 --> 00:25.735
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

00:29.016 --> 00:31.985
- It's a little crowded. Do you mind?
- Could you scooch?

00:32.386 --> 00:34.013
Move over just a little bit.

00:35.423 --> 00:36.754
Keep on scooching.

00:38.292 --> 00:41.819
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I'm...

00:42.029 --> 00:44.054
Why? What is wrong with me?

00:44.265 --> 00:46.096
- What's the matter?
- Tim...

00:46.367 --> 00:48.096
...I have a feeling...

00:48.302 --> 00:52.068
...my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

00:54.876 --> 00:56.173
How do you know?

00:56.377 --> 00:57.901
- He's got access.
- I know.

00:59.981 --> 01:01.471
It's a feeling you get.

01:01.782 --> 01:04.046
Like when you're in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

01:04.252 --> 01:05.685
That's the one.

01:06.821 --> 01:09.221
- So you went to Pete's.
- What happened?

01:09.457 --> 01:11.823
Why is this happening to me?

01:12.026 --> 01:13.584
Maybe it's my wound.

01:14.061 --> 01:15.756
Forget it.

01:16.831 --> 01:18.264
It's not healed yet?

01:18.432 --> 01:19.865
It's oozing!

01:20.368 --> 01:22.802
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

01:23.037 --> 01:24.470
Thank you very much.

01:25.506 --> 01:29.442
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but I wanted it to come from me.

01:29.677 --> 01:32.407
- What is it?
- I've been sleeping with your wife.

01:32.613 --> 01:33.671
You're the gynecologist?

01:33.948 --> 01:36.610
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

01:38.386 --> 01:41.287
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

01:41.489 --> 01:43.855
Just give me the thing, all right?

01:45.359 --> 01:48.817
Enough!
And you are no longer my friend!

01:49.030 --> 01:51.021
We are finished! Nada!
No more!

01:51.299 --> 01:53.233
You are a bastard for doing that!

01:53.501 --> 01:54.968
Stay away from me!

01:55.736 --> 01:56.794
Come back!

02:05.213 --> 02:08.011
So, what were you gonna tell us?

02:09.016 --> 02:10.347
I have no idea.

02:14.889 --> 02:18.882
The One With the Ultimate Fighting Champion

02:59.934 --> 03:02.801
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

03:02.970 --> 03:05.200
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

03:05.973 --> 03:08.305
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

03:08.643 --> 03:10.702
He didn't ask me to marry him.

03:10.911 --> 03:13.345
Then definitely don't take his name!

03:14.849 --> 03:18.307
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate...

03:18.519 --> 03:20.316
...Fighting Competition thingy.

03:20.521 --> 03:22.887
- Pete?
- Why? What is it?

03:23.157 --> 03:25.717
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.

03:27.061 --> 03:28.926
But without the costumes.

03:30.231 --> 03:32.358
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.

03:32.667 --> 03:36.865
It's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, "There are no rules"!

03:37.938 --> 03:41.999
- I heard you made a great 12-year-old.
- It was the best year of my life.

03:42.176 --> 03:44.701
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

03:44.979 --> 03:48.210
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

03:48.482 --> 03:50.882
- What's fish-hooking?
- What's fish-hook...?

03:53.521 --> 03:56.490
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

03:56.857 --> 03:58.347
What is that taste?

03:59.060 --> 04:02.587
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.990
Thanks for the warm welcome.

04:08.269 --> 04:12.706
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play. I hope you do too.

04:12.907 --> 04:15.375
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

04:15.609 --> 04:18.169
There is no I in "team."

04:18.412 --> 04:22.405
Yes, but there's two in "martini."
So, everybody, back to my office.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.250
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

04:26.520 --> 04:28.579
It's Bing, sir.
I'm sorry. I was just...

04:28.856 --> 04:32.223
No, no. I heard what you said.
Funny. I like funny.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.393
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

04:35.629 --> 04:37.620
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

04:44.872 --> 04:46.362
That's right. Ryder.

04:47.108 --> 04:49.440
Winona Ryder for six.

04:51.979 --> 04:52.968
Thank you.

04:53.147 --> 04:55.547
Yeah. We have the reservations.

04:56.283 --> 04:58.274
All right, buddy! Way to go!

05:00.955 --> 05:02.320
Dude, what are you doing?

05:02.957 --> 05:07.394
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like it's no big deal.

05:07.595 --> 05:09.119
What'd you do about it?

05:09.330 --> 05:12.128
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy...

05:12.333 --> 05:15.234
...who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

05:16.070 --> 05:19.403
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay
to be that guy.

05:20.408 --> 05:21.841
Maybe it's that jock thing.

05:22.076 --> 05:25.807
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

05:28.115 --> 05:30.242
You know, I don't understand guys.

05:30.518 --> 05:33.954
I mean, I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew...

05:34.155 --> 05:36.419
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.454
I know. For a really great stew,
you'd just...

05:40.694 --> 05:42.491
...stick your head in between them.

05:44.198 --> 05:45.631
Can we please go eat?

05:45.866 --> 05:48.960
- Yeah, what are we getting?
- Anything but stew.

05:49.970 --> 05:53.462
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

05:53.707 --> 05:55.436
Don't turn your back to him.

05:56.043 --> 05:58.603
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

05:58.846 --> 06:03.442
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

06:03.651 --> 06:07.018
Then, when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

06:09.857 --> 06:13.486
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

06:16.464 --> 06:18.455
What if Joey was president?

06:21.902 --> 06:23.233
Can I ask you something?

06:24.004 --> 06:25.699
Okay, you can totally say no...

06:25.973 --> 06:30.000
...but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date?

06:31.712 --> 06:33.043
With who?

06:33.347 --> 06:36.145
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute...

06:36.383 --> 06:39.011
...and she asked if I could set it up.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.984
- But if that's not cool...
- Which one is Bonnie?

06:42.189 --> 06:44.680
You remember her from
my birthday party?

06:44.925 --> 06:47.052
Average height...

06:47.261 --> 06:49.491
...medium build, bald...

06:53.367 --> 06:55.426
That's fine.

06:55.603 --> 06:59.801
- Really?
- Ross and the bald girl? Absolutely.

06:59.974 --> 07:03.273
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

07:08.916 --> 07:11.749
You are iron! You are steel!

07:12.453 --> 07:16.014
Let me ask you, how come when I call
your computer support line...

07:16.223 --> 07:18.282
...I have to wait an hour and a half?

07:18.592 --> 07:22.050
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

07:22.263 --> 07:25.699
It's just hard when I know
I have e-mail I can't get.

07:28.502 --> 07:30.993
- Hi.
- Monica.

07:31.739 --> 07:35.072
- Hi, honey.
- On the table. On the table, please.

07:38.646 --> 07:41.877
So listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about...

07:42.082 --> 07:43.811
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

07:44.118 --> 07:46.086
It sounds really dangerous.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.346
I don't want you to get hurt
because I kind of like you.

07:49.523 --> 07:53.050
I don't want to get hurt either.
I'm being smart about this.

07:53.294 --> 07:56.320
See these guys? They're
the best trainers in the world.

07:56.564 --> 07:59.431
And Hoshi here used to be
a paid assassin.

08:00.034 --> 08:02.696
A house painter!
He used to be a house painter!

08:05.339 --> 08:08.069
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- I promise.

08:08.242 --> 08:11.336
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because...

08:11.579 --> 08:14.309
...maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

08:14.582 --> 08:16.209
No boom-boom before big fight!

08:21.322 --> 08:22.619
How about just a boom?

08:27.328 --> 08:29.626
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel...

08:29.830 --> 08:31.923
...from one of the kids from Fame.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.734
Ready to go to the movies?
Oh, this is Bonnie!

08:36.003 --> 08:37.027
Hi!

08:38.138 --> 08:39.298
This is Bonnie?

08:39.540 --> 08:41.440
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

08:41.609 --> 08:44.578
I can show you an ID. If you want.

08:44.745 --> 08:48.841
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time I saw you.

08:49.016 --> 08:51.951
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
started wearing bras again.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.549
Oh, that must be it.

08:56.123 --> 08:57.283
Have fun tonight.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.686
Thanks. You too.

09:05.532 --> 09:06.794
You said she was bald.

09:07.034 --> 09:08.797
She was bald. She's not now.

09:10.904 --> 09:12.735
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

09:12.906 --> 09:15.898
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.

09:16.176 --> 09:17.939
Oh, well, this is just perfect!

09:18.712 --> 09:21.579
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.

09:21.749 --> 09:26.345
I said it was okay when I thought
she was some weird bald chick.

09:26.553 --> 09:29.021
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

09:31.558 --> 09:35.654
- Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
- Does she have a bad personality?

09:35.829 --> 09:38.059
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

09:43.704 --> 09:45.331
Bing!

09:46.840 --> 09:49.741
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

09:51.178 --> 09:53.908
Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

09:54.848 --> 09:56.076
Come on.

09:56.283 --> 09:57.807
Oh, yeah! Good one.

09:57.985 --> 10:00.613
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

10:02.256 --> 10:03.917
- What is with him?
- "With him"?

10:04.191 --> 10:06.591
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!

10:06.794 --> 10:08.159
We never get smacked.

10:09.863 --> 10:11.831
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

10:11.999 --> 10:15.264
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

10:15.602 --> 10:18.594
I'm telling you,
I need some smacks.

10:19.239 --> 10:21.002
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

10:21.308 --> 10:24.141
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

10:24.378 --> 10:25.811
- You go to Dartmouth?
- No, sir.

10:26.113 --> 10:27.603
There you go!

10:36.090 --> 10:37.614
God, Ross! What is that?

10:37.791 --> 10:39.554
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.888
I saved 30 cents.
Plus, I get to keep the cup.

10:45.065 --> 10:47.499
From New York City, New York...

10:47.768 --> 10:51.864
...appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut...

10:52.039 --> 10:55.805
...he's known for his
confrontational business style!

10:57.077 --> 11:00.513
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

11:00.748 --> 11:03.148
...Pete Becker!

11:08.922 --> 11:10.321
I love you, Pete!

11:14.194 --> 11:18.358
And his opponent,
from Huntington Beach, California...

11:18.532 --> 11:22.434
...he's a 300-pound
street fighter...

11:22.936 --> 11:25.234
...Tank Abbott!

11:38.218 --> 11:40.118
Pete? Pete?

11:40.521 --> 11:42.716
- That guy's pretty huge.
- Don't worry.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.458
I'll use his strength
and weight against him.

11:45.726 --> 11:49.822
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

11:55.068 --> 11:56.729
You go get him. Let's go!

11:58.205 --> 11:59.866
Here we go, gentlemen.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.402
Are you ready?

12:04.578 --> 12:07.138
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

12:30.003 --> 12:31.265
It's me.

12:31.505 --> 12:33.200
Monica.

12:35.576 --> 12:36.702
Who else would it be?

12:36.877 --> 12:40.540
Earlier, when you were coming to,
you called me Fran.

12:42.649 --> 12:45.379
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you?

12:45.552 --> 12:49.579
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck!"

12:50.691 --> 12:52.682
I thought you were nuts at first...

12:52.926 --> 12:54.484
...but you did it.

12:54.895 --> 12:58.058
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

12:58.232 --> 12:59.699
Look back?

13:00.367 --> 13:02.358
You're not gonna keep going?

13:02.603 --> 13:06.471
Let me ask you a question:
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

13:08.442 --> 13:10.273
Well, no. But...

13:10.444 --> 13:13.811
I'm not gonna stop until I'm
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

13:14.748 --> 13:18.684
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

13:19.353 --> 13:21.048
Let me tell you a story.

13:21.955 --> 13:26.255
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

13:26.526 --> 13:30.929
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

13:31.198 --> 13:35.100
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

13:35.302 --> 13:37.702
And 862 others that I learned from.

13:37.905 --> 13:41.841
Just like I learned from this fight,
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

13:42.009 --> 13:44.136
You didn't know that already?

13:45.646 --> 13:47.807
Look, I'm gonna get better.

13:48.482 --> 13:50.575
Okay? I promise you.

13:54.321 --> 13:56.653
Just get a lot better.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.648
Fast.

14:00.661 --> 14:01.719
One other thing.

14:01.962 --> 14:05.796
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

14:06.433 --> 14:07.957
Yeah.

14:08.135 --> 14:10.433
That was the problem.

14:16.310 --> 14:19.177
- How long until Pete's fight?
- About five minutes.

14:19.446 --> 14:21.277
They're interviewing his opponent.

14:21.448 --> 14:25.441
Apparently, he trains by going to Iran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.118
- Hot dog?
- Four, please.

14:29.589 --> 14:31.181
I'm really nervous.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.183
Thank you.

14:35.562 --> 14:38.725
So, Ross, how did it go with Bonnie?

14:38.899 --> 14:43.029
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

14:43.303 --> 14:46.204
I actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

14:46.473 --> 14:48.498
But she's really terrific.

14:48.675 --> 14:50.666
It's too bad.

14:52.145 --> 14:54.739
No, I'm saying I liked her.

14:54.915 --> 14:56.849
There are other fish in the sea.

14:57.985 --> 15:01.352
I think she's great, okay?
We're going out again.

15:01.855 --> 15:06.224
I hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

15:06.893 --> 15:08.884
Which one's my turkey burger?

15:09.196 --> 15:11.391
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

15:12.399 --> 15:14.629
- Fight's starting!
- We'll be right in.

15:14.835 --> 15:17.827
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

15:18.005 --> 15:20.098
Nine times.

15:20.307 --> 15:21.968
I had to put on lotion.

15:24.044 --> 15:26.911
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

15:27.180 --> 15:31.139
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

15:31.818 --> 15:33.012
Fight's over!

15:38.625 --> 15:40.024
Excuse me, Doug?

15:42.496 --> 15:44.487
Hey there, sports fan!

15:44.865 --> 15:47.333
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

15:47.534 --> 15:49.627
No. I didn't do them.

15:49.803 --> 15:51.566
You forgot?

15:51.872 --> 15:54.500
No, I just didn't do them.

15:54.674 --> 15:58.235
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

15:58.512 --> 16:01.174
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

16:01.415 --> 16:03.007
...or otherwise.

16:03.650 --> 16:06.744
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

16:06.987 --> 16:09.421
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

16:10.490 --> 16:13.653
That's okay. You're still
my number-one guy! Bing!

16:14.261 --> 16:15.853
Doug!

16:16.730 --> 16:21.224
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

16:21.435 --> 16:23.995
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?

16:24.204 --> 16:28.197
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

16:30.277 --> 16:33.007
It's not about the swearing.
It's more about...

16:33.246 --> 16:35.737
...the way that you occasionally...

16:36.016 --> 16:39.452
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

16:40.720 --> 16:42.415
...on my buttocks.

16:44.724 --> 16:47.625
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the sentiment.

16:47.861 --> 16:51.820
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.

16:53.633 --> 16:56.830
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

16:57.037 --> 17:01.201
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

17:01.374 --> 17:03.239
Bing, you're okay.

17:13.553 --> 17:17.080
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

17:17.324 --> 17:19.815
...or inside his shower drain?

17:21.895 --> 17:23.089
Oh, my God.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.722
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

17:29.169 --> 17:33.731
Look at that! It's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!

17:35.575 --> 17:39.671
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

17:39.946 --> 17:41.413
I hope he lets her down easy.

17:41.648 --> 17:44.640
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

17:44.951 --> 17:48.011
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

17:48.522 --> 17:51.013
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

17:51.191 --> 17:53.819
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

17:53.994 --> 17:55.188
Oh, God!

17:55.362 --> 17:59.992
It's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.429
You said it was okay.

18:02.602 --> 18:04.729
You said she was bald!

18:04.905 --> 18:08.602
Was! Was, was, was!

18:09.876 --> 18:13.676
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

18:13.980 --> 18:18.314
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

18:20.020 --> 18:21.920
Okay, first of all, breathe.

18:23.190 --> 18:25.454
Second of all, I don't get it.

18:25.725 --> 18:28.956
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

18:30.964 --> 18:32.226
Yes.

18:32.399 --> 18:36.130
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

18:40.307 --> 18:41.638
So?

18:45.745 --> 18:50.273
It's just, you know, I didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

18:59.993 --> 19:00.982
- Oh, no.
- What?

19:01.194 --> 19:02.320
We killed them all!

19:18.511 --> 19:21.378
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.

19:21.648 --> 19:24.515
I'm not supposed to move my spine.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.585
Please tell me you're stopping now.

19:28.822 --> 19:32.314
I'm fine. I'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

19:33.493 --> 19:35.927
Now, see this circle
I'm marking off here?

19:36.096 --> 19:38.496
This is my Zone of Terror.

19:39.499 --> 19:44.368
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

19:44.537 --> 19:47.404
I can't until I'm
the ultimate fighter.

19:47.574 --> 19:48.768
I will do it.

19:48.975 --> 19:53.241
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight...

19:53.480 --> 19:55.505
...me or Superman.

19:57.350 --> 20:00.319
Not that I could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

20:01.521 --> 20:02.783
Just sit down.

20:02.989 --> 20:04.854
Please listen to me.

20:05.091 --> 20:10.085
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst ultimate fighter ever.

20:10.530 --> 20:11.656
Ever!

20:12.966 --> 20:17.027
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm...

20:17.270 --> 20:21.502
...and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

20:27.013 --> 20:29.277
Well, then, you know what?

20:31.351 --> 20:35.515
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

20:35.989 --> 20:39.390
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

20:39.893 --> 20:41.827
If you're asking me to quit...

20:42.128 --> 20:44.892
...then you're asking me
to be someone I'm not.

20:45.198 --> 20:46.756
I've got to do this.

20:51.004 --> 20:52.938
Then I've gotta go.

20:54.641 --> 20:55.665
Bye.

21:01.414 --> 21:03.848
- Monica?
- Yes?

21:04.017 --> 21:06.076
Could you leave a note?
I'm on painkillers...

21:06.353 --> 21:08.583
...and I might not
remember this tomorrow.

21:13.927 --> 21:18.921
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so I'm happy.

21:19.899 --> 21:22.265
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

21:22.769 --> 21:25.829
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

21:26.039 --> 21:28.269
Goldberg, you maniac!

21:28.508 --> 21:30.066
I love you!

21:33.380 --> 21:36.178
- Couldn't have done it without you.
- Thank you, sir.

21:36.383 --> 21:37.680
Oh, excuse me.

21:37.884 --> 21:41.615
I forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

21:41.888 --> 21:45.415
Of course, you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

21:48.094 --> 21:50.358
Well, what about you?

21:50.530 --> 21:52.930
You're not feeling left out, are you?

21:54.234 --> 21:56.998
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

21:57.170 --> 22:00.298
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

22:03.076 --> 22:04.941
Yes, I do.

22:05.311 --> 22:07.370
Now, get on out of here, you!

22:11.918 --> 22:13.613
Pete Becker circles the ring.

22:13.787 --> 22:16.255
Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.

22:16.423 --> 22:17.913
- Bruiser is charging!
- Run.

22:18.091 --> 22:21.720
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

22:22.729 --> 22:23.923
I can't watch this.

22:24.097 --> 22:25.792
Check it out! Pete's winning!

22:25.965 --> 22:28.160
- Really?
- No!

22:30.670 --> 22:35.107
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas
and is going for his favorite area!

22:36.910 --> 22:40.812
Wait! If that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

22:41.481 --> 22:42.641
This is ironic.

22:42.816 --> 22:45.580
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

22:45.752 --> 22:46.946
From the looks of it,
now Pete can't.

22:50.623 --> 22:51.612
