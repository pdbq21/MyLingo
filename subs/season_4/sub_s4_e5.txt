00:03.870 --> 00:08.170
Joe, I don't think a four-letter word
for "ship" can be "ship."

00:10.343 --> 00:12.777
I thought it was a freebie.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.280
Hello!

00:20.787 --> 00:22.084
What's this?

00:22.322 --> 00:25.314
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.158
There it is.
Just a phone number...

00:31.431 --> 00:34.298
...a really hot girl gave me.

00:36.002 --> 00:40.098
It's no big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number, but....

00:49.783 --> 00:51.978
Almost lost this baby!

00:52.685 --> 00:57.179
The lovely Amanda gives me her
number, and I go and drop it.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.460
Thank you.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.036
The One with
Joey's New Girlfriend

01:57.083 --> 01:59.984
-When's your birthday?
-May 5th. Why?

02:00.186 --> 02:02.518
I'm making a list of birthdays.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.089
-Mine's December
-Yeah, whatever.

02:09.762 --> 02:10.990
She's pretty!

02:11.197 --> 02:14.689
Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty
She's pretty.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.662
Go ask her out.

02:18.271 --> 02:21.570
-What's the worst that could happen?
-I could die.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.640
Yeah, it's tough being single.

02:24.878 --> 02:28.041
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.673
Ross, you guys went out once.

02:31.885 --> 02:36.185
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.192
I tell people secrets.

02:42.762 --> 02:44.229
It makes them like me.

02:46.466 --> 02:52.302
All I'm gonna say is, finally, it's
nice to be in a mature relationship.

02:52.472 --> 02:55.168
You know, the world would
be such a better place...

02:55.341 --> 02:59.277
...if that actually was
all you were gonna say.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.543
Phoebe.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.743
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.445
But I'm unemployed.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.281
My music is all I really have now.

03:12.892 --> 03:16.760
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.493
All right, I'm gonna do it.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.567
I'm gonna go get shot down.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.434
Any advice?

03:27.640 --> 03:28.971
Just be yourself...

03:29.242 --> 03:31.142
...but not too much.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.405
Wish me luck.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.179
Good luck!

03:39.586 --> 03:41.144
Wish it!

03:43.856 --> 03:46.825
I was just sitting over there and....

03:47.327 --> 03:49.261
My name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

03:49.462 --> 03:51.657
No, you didn't.
Hi, I'm Kathy.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.765
-Kathy with a K or a C?
-With a K.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.765
Wow, you are really good at this!

04:00.173 --> 04:01.902
I'm out on a limb here!

04:02.175 --> 04:04.075
I'm sorry.
You're right.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.768
But I should tell you,
I'm waiting for a date.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.478
And there he is now!

04:13.353 --> 04:15.753
I see you guys already met.

04:16.155 --> 04:18.146
I was trying to demonstrate...

04:18.358 --> 04:20.826
...how I could get my
very large feet...

04:21.027 --> 04:23.257
...into my even bigger mouth.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.993
Didn't I tell you?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.457
Always showing off.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.205
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

04:33.539 --> 04:37.635
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.971
Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."

04:44.784 --> 04:48.379
Smelly cat, smelly cat

04:48.688 --> 04:51.555
What are they feeding you?

04:52.525 --> 04:54.959
This chick sounds good.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.056
Smelly cat

04:58.564 --> 05:02.022
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

05:11.911 --> 05:15.142
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to have to fight over the remote.

05:15.581 --> 05:19.244
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.146
That's why I got up too.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.979
You're kidding?
I love him!

05:23.156 --> 05:25.624
My dad made me stay up
and watch reruns with him.

05:25.792 --> 05:29.387
Mine too. Did your dad also make
you watch the Mr. Universe contest?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.826
-No.
-Well, me neither.

05:36.269 --> 05:40.638
I'm sorry about this afternoon. If I had
known that you two, I never would have....

05:40.807 --> 05:42.798
Oh, please.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.570
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

05:46.746 --> 05:50.682
They teamed us up as partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us to do.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.612
All of them had us making out.

05:53.886 --> 05:57.754
That's a good thing because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

06:00.393 --> 06:04.295
-ls it on?
-No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!

06:07.300 --> 06:09.097
Oh, my God!

06:10.770 --> 06:11.759
It's on!

06:18.444 --> 06:21.208
Here we go, little fella.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.742
What about the duck?

06:23.950 --> 06:25.781
The duck can swim.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.621
My sticky shoes

06:31.891 --> 06:35.088
My sticky, sticky shoes

06:35.895 --> 06:38.329
Why you stick on me?

06:38.598 --> 06:40.463
Baby

06:42.835 --> 06:44.826
Thanks for the lights, honey.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.602
Way to go!

06:49.809 --> 06:51.743
Your cold makes you sound great.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.607
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

06:59.652 --> 07:03.110
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.582
I love them.

07:04.824 --> 07:09.158
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.224
-Well, have fun.
-Okay.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.098
It's nice that
the medical community...

07:16.302 --> 07:18.327
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.204
-lsn't it?
-Yeah, it's great.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.338
You know what?
I like Kathy.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.581
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

07:29.816 --> 07:30.805
She is.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.314
She's smart and funny.

07:33.519 --> 07:37.717
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about

07:37.990 --> 07:38.820
What?

07:40.326 --> 07:42.453
You love her.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.520
No, I don't.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.130
Yes, you do.
Chandler loves Kathy.

07:48.701 --> 07:52.637
-Come on, just lay off him.
-Thank you.

07:52.872 --> 07:56.535
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

07:57.243 --> 07:58.403
All right.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.647
Kathy, I love you!

08:14.093 --> 08:18.257
I need to write some depressing stuff
to go with my new bluesy voice.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.989
But nothing that sad has
ever really happened to me.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.327
How about your mom dying?

08:23.536 --> 08:26.232
Or having to live on the streets
when you were 14?

08:29.242 --> 08:32.905
I could write about the time
my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.550
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.481
Rachel's not here.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.122
How's it going with her?

08:47.426 --> 08:51.157
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

08:51.330 --> 08:55.198
The kids are gonna play together,
and then when they're asleep...

08:55.434 --> 08:58.301
...I'm thinking Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

08:58.604 --> 09:01.596
...do a little playing ourselves.

09:04.143 --> 09:06.668
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.471
Josh, these are my friends.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.375
And that's Ross.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.748
Dudes.

09:15.421 --> 09:16.615
You played in college?

09:16.923 --> 09:20.450
I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.661
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

09:24.931 --> 09:29.334
No, wait. You just organized
their game schedules on your Commodore 64.

09:30.002 --> 09:34.496
It's getting late. I gotta get
to the game, so I'm gonna...head.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.442
I'll miss you.

09:41.647 --> 09:42.909
Dope!

09:47.620 --> 09:49.110
Wow! Cute one.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.586
-Very cute.
-I know. Isn't he great?

09:51.824 --> 09:56.284
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

09:56.495 --> 09:58.690
There's nothing boring about him.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.161
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.162
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.937
Like on a class trip or something.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.205
You know what else is
great about him?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.376
What is the word for an adult...

10:12.612 --> 10:15.172
...who doesn't have dinosaur
toys in their bedroom?

10:21.687 --> 10:22.949
What was that?

10:23.189 --> 10:24.281
Monica knows.

10:24.490 --> 10:28.153
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up
to try to fool our parents.

10:28.361 --> 10:32.320
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually having to give it.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.396
I cried the night you made that up.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.468
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.038
I'm going to go get ready...

10:49.548 --> 10:52.346
...for my date tonight...

10:52.551 --> 10:54.348
...so I'll just "head."

10:56.756 --> 11:00.487
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.992
You guys should come hear me.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.726
Hear me.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.898
My sticky shoes

11:13.539 --> 11:15.598
I lost my sexy phlegm!

11:22.014 --> 11:23.242
Hi, Ben.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.882
-You look great!
-Thanks.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.213
Hey, Tommy!

11:29.455 --> 11:31.685
I am so glad that you
could come over tonight.

11:31.924 --> 11:35.087
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.954
My cell phone number
is here on the counter.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.392
Please, help yourself to
anything in the fridge.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.760
I appreciate this so much. I have
been trying to go out with...

11:43.969 --> 11:45.561
...this guy for a month.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.099
I'd really appreciate it if you'd
wait and drink your wine...

11:50.309 --> 11:52.607
...after the kids are asleep.

11:57.950 --> 12:02.319
I blocked the adult channels for the other
babysitters, but the code is four, three

12:02.488 --> 12:04.752
I'm fine.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.952
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.860
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

12:28.114 --> 12:31.174
Kathy!
Kathy! Hi!

12:31.484 --> 12:33.384
Kathy!
Kathy!

12:42.194 --> 12:43.456
Kathy!

12:48.534 --> 12:50.001
Fetch!
Fetch it!

12:53.172 --> 12:55.037
Kathy!
Kathy!

12:55.241 --> 12:56.503
Kathy!

13:02.414 --> 13:03.676
Kathy!

13:08.087 --> 13:09.349
Kathy!

13:10.556 --> 13:12.615
Chandler, what are you doing here?

13:14.426 --> 13:16.189
I just wanted to say, "Hey!"

13:17.263 --> 13:18.491
Hey.

13:19.198 --> 13:20.460
Okay.

13:28.908 --> 13:31.570
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.904
Her date tipped me $10!

13:38.551 --> 13:39.984
What are you doing?

13:40.319 --> 13:43.777
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.957
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.588
You'll catch pneumonia!

13:51.797 --> 13:55.096
Okay, you were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

13:55.301 --> 13:56.768
-What?
-Are you serious?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.266
How is that possible?
You barely know her.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.200
I don't know. I just

14:01.473 --> 14:03.771
I can't get her out of my head.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.137
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.314
I'm a horrible person.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.783
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

14:18.224 --> 14:20.351
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.789
You mean you stole it!

14:24.797 --> 14:27.789
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

14:31.370 --> 14:33.838
We were just talking about you.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.395
Really?

14:36.375 --> 14:38.866
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

14:39.178 --> 14:40.907
...with your head in the toilet.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.811
Right in there!

14:45.751 --> 14:48.151
-What movie did you get?
-I got what I always get.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.185
Die Hard.

14:50.756 --> 14:53.725
That's what I like about Joey.
Any other guy would have been:

14:53.893 --> 14:57.124
"Yeah, The English Patient
is my favorite movie too."

14:57.296 --> 15:01.096
But Joey goes, "No way.
Let's get Die Hard.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.259
I'm not watching that English crap."

15:04.536 --> 15:07.061
Yeah, he's dreamy.

15:09.174 --> 15:13.474
I gotta go.
I gotta go meet some friends.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.977
He has other friends?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.319
Ninety-nine...

15:24.823 --> 15:28.020
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

15:30.496 --> 15:33.465
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

15:35.734 --> 15:39.465
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

15:40.806 --> 15:43.001
You know what?
I already ate.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.232
It's 4:30.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.208
I had a big meal on Monday.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.974
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.417
I see what's going on here.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.845
-You do?
-Yeah.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.580
You don't like Kathy.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.384
You got me.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.859
You've been avoiding her
ever since we started going out.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.226
I made an effort to like Janice.

16:08.500 --> 16:12.994
Now I think it's your turn to make an effort
to like Kathy by going out with us. Right?

16:13.205 --> 16:16.174
-Yeah, right.
-Good. And hey, my treat.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.344
-Only because you're not eating, right?
-Right.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.947
Sorry, Grandma.

16:35.394 --> 16:36.656
Ross isn't here.

16:38.364 --> 16:39.524
Stop it!

16:42.868 --> 16:44.802
I'll see you at the party?

16:44.970 --> 16:48.428
Beer's fear, man!
Twenty-four, seven!

16:53.345 --> 16:55.813
I am so gonna marry that guy.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.107
What?

17:00.319 --> 17:03.482
-I think he's stealing from me.
-Why?

17:03.756 --> 17:06.418
Because he's stealing from me!

17:07.426 --> 17:08.859
Hi, it's me...

17:09.094 --> 17:10.322
...and soup.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.932
I just saw Josh. He looked so
yummy in your leather jacket.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.761
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

17:22.541 --> 17:27.001
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really just noodle water.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.139
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.549
What are you doing?

17:34.753 --> 17:38.689
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.289
I miss my sexy voice.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.494
Sorry, Phoebe.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.354
It's okay.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.189
How's the soup?

18:03.882 --> 18:07.181
Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

18:07.386 --> 18:09.081
Is she great, or what?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.351
What do you think?

18:13.058 --> 18:14.753
She's not really my type.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.688
Not your type?
She's gorgeous.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.366
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.866
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet
stockings, it reminds me of...

18:25.104 --> 18:27.095
...my father in fishnet stockings.

18:28.907 --> 18:32.240
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

18:32.511 --> 18:36.174
I have a friend you'd like. She's really
pretty. And then we could double date.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.440
No, thanks.

18:38.684 --> 18:42.745
I've got some ugly friends, and
they're all available too.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.751
I'm gonna grab a beer.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.286
I'll be right back.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.799
-What was that?
-What?

18:57.302 --> 19:00.362
Kathy's being really nice
and you just walked away.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.403
What do you want from me?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.268
I want you to like her.

19:04.543 --> 19:08.445
If that's too damn difficult for you,
then the least you could do is pretend.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.575
-I am pretending.
-Then do it better.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.609
What do you say I go over there and
tell her how much I like her?

19:16.121 --> 19:18.589
I can tell her how much
I've been thinking of her.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.122
I haven't stopped thinking
about her since we met.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.328
I'm so over the top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

19:24.563 --> 19:27.555
...in love with her
that for every minute...

19:27.766 --> 19:31.827
...I can't believe my own damn bad
luck that you met her first!

19:32.271 --> 19:33.568
That's pretty good.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.603
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

19:43.448 --> 19:47.179
I still have a fever? Are you
sure that thing's working right?

19:47.352 --> 19:50.583
Well, we could take
it the other way.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.619
So Amanda just dropped me off.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.456
That's one of the things
I love about her.

20:00.632 --> 20:02.600
She's old enough to drive.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.735
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

20:08.006 --> 20:09.166
No, sorry.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.033
Where's Amanda?

20:11.343 --> 20:12.867
Could you get me
some cough drops?

20:13.111 --> 20:15.375
I'm thinking you could bring her...

20:15.581 --> 20:18.880
...and you guys could go up to your
old room and not make out.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.550
Cough drop, please?

20:21.787 --> 20:24.085
At least she's not
going out with me...

20:24.356 --> 20:26.347
...to get into R-rated movies.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.085
Why don't you just marry her?

20:30.362 --> 20:34.059
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

20:36.635 --> 20:39.900
-Amanda and I have a
-You have nothing!

20:40.305 --> 20:43.866
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

20:44.209 --> 20:47.201
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

20:54.786 --> 20:56.583
That is so sad.

20:58.657 --> 21:02.093
And what are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

21:02.294 --> 21:03.886
...-is-stealing-from-me?

21:06.598 --> 21:09.089
So he stole a couple bucks
from me. Big deal!

21:09.334 --> 21:11.165
At least he got me
something with it.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.098
That's mine!

21:16.008 --> 21:19.774
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

21:20.012 --> 21:22.480
And give me my cough drops!

21:24.182 --> 21:26.173
-Fine.
-Sorry.

21:26.385 --> 21:27.317
Here.

21:27.519 --> 21:28.713
Thank you.

21:31.356 --> 21:34.154
At least I made $10 in
my relationship.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.491
You know...?

21:44.236 --> 21:47.000
Parading goats are parading

21:47.306 --> 21:49.331
Parading down the street

21:50.075 --> 21:52.737
Parading goats are parading

21:53.011 --> 21:55.912
Leaving little treats

21:56.848 --> 21:59.578
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

21:59.818 --> 22:01.251
I like it.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.412
-Gunther, kiss me.
-What?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.590
Do it, deputy!
Do something!

22:27.612 --> 22:30.911
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

22:39.257 --> 22:41.350
Can I sleep on your couch?

22:53.505 --> 22:55.837
And I'm still waiting

22:56.041 --> 22:58.509
For my papier-mache man

23:01.380 --> 23:04.076
Thank you, my babies.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.080
Rachel?

23:09.988 --> 23:13.719
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

23:15.127 --> 23:19.757
We kissed. I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.989
I've been feeling guilty.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.666
Okay.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.271
So...

23:29.207 --> 23:30.196
...are we cool?

23:34.212 --> 23:35.474
Okay.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.975
I knew you would understand.
