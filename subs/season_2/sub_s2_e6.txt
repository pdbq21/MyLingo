WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:04.033
Who the winny-binny boy?

00:04.905 --> 00:09.035
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

00:10.711 --> 00:12.736
Don't cry.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.039
Don't cry.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.082
Why is he still crying?

00:19.082 --> 00:24.082
Don't worry. Nothing can't be solved by happy keys.

00:24.082 --> 00:29.082
yeah, I was feel much better when someone shaked Jacks medal in my face.

00:31.319 --> 00:33.378
Let me hold him for a sec.

00:33.588 --> 00:34.953
Here we go.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.155
There we are.

00:38.994 --> 00:40.120
Maybe it's me.

00:40.462 --> 00:44.330
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

00:44.633 --> 00:47.261
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

00:48.470 --> 00:50.995
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.637
There we go, all better.

00:54.242 --> 00:56.233
There's my little boy.

01:02.684 --> 01:04.982
Can I see something?

01:18.767 --> 01:19.665
Cool!

01:19.868 --> 01:22.393
He hates me.
My nephew hates me!

01:22.393 --> 01:24.604
I'm unemployed, and my nephew hates me!

01:24.604 --> 01:27.866
Stop, don't do this. You are just unemployed.

01:30.105 --> 01:32.801
What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do then?

01:33.008 --> 01:34.532
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

01:34.843 --> 01:38.779
Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this problem?

01:39.648 --> 01:42.276
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

01:44.620 --> 01:46.850
Joey, she does not look fat.

01:48.057 --> 01:50.116
The One With the Baby on the Bus

02:33.403 --> 02:34.836
Here you go.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.241
Goo, goo, goo!

02:44.447 --> 02:47.348
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

02:54.958 --> 02:55.788
You okay?

02:56.026 --> 02:57.288
I don't know.

02:59.462 --> 03:01.020
What's in this pie?

03:01.231 --> 03:04.928
I don't know. Butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi

03:05.135 --> 03:07.296
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

03:08.038 --> 03:09.471
You said it was a key lime pie.

03:09.706 --> 03:13.608
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

03:13.877 --> 03:15.868
That's what's gonna kill me.

03:17.814 --> 03:19.145
I'm allergic to kiwi.

03:19.716 --> 03:23.379
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and

03:25.622 --> 03:26.884
Oh, my God!

03:27.090 --> 03:28.887
It's definitely getting worse.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.318
Is your tongue swelling up?

03:31.795 --> 03:34.423
Either that or my mouth
is getting smaller!

03:35.231 --> 03:37.426
Get your coat.
We're going to the hospital.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.898
-Will he be okay?
-He's gotta get a shot.

03:40.103 --> 03:43.470
You know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

03:43.673 --> 03:46.073
Let's not go.
Anyone up for Scrabble?

03:47.243 --> 03:49.006
Jacket, now!

03:49.446 --> 03:52.677
What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospital.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.110
We'll watch him.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.009
I don't think so.

03:58.288 --> 04:02.588
I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

04:03.093 --> 04:05.027
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

04:05.261 --> 04:07.354
I was gonna play basketball...

04:07.597 --> 04:09.497
... but I guess that's out the window.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.794
If you take him out for a walk,
remember to bring his hat.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.801
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.473
Hat, milk....

04:18.675 --> 04:19.505
Got it!

04:29.052 --> 04:30.451
Consider it done!

04:30.954 --> 04:31.784
You understood?

04:32.021 --> 04:34.888
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.055
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

04:45.101 --> 04:48.537
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

04:48.772 --> 04:51.297
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

04:53.610 --> 04:58.070
I'm in the shower
And I'm writing a song

04:58.648 --> 05:02.379
Stop me if you've heard it

05:04.754 --> 05:08.554
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

05:08.792 --> 05:12.956
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

05:16.766 --> 05:20.896
Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

05:24.674 --> 05:25.902
What's up?

05:26.476 --> 05:28.171
F Y I:

05:28.445 --> 05:32.643
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

05:32.849 --> 05:36.979
Her name is Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

05:37.187 --> 05:39.246
But what about Phoebe?

05:40.190 --> 05:42.988
It's not that your friend is bad.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.920
It's that she's so bad...

05:47.497 --> 05:52.196
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

05:52.435 --> 05:54.096
...and swirl it around.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.606
Okay, so you're not a fan.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.377
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

06:06.382 --> 06:07.872
I have to do this to her?

06:08.151 --> 06:10.210
Lather, rinse, repeat

06:10.453 --> 06:12.648
And lather, rinse, repeat

06:12.856 --> 06:16.348
And lather, rinse, repeat

06:16.559 --> 06:18.288
As needed

06:25.001 --> 06:26.628
We didn't bring enough stuff.

06:27.336 --> 06:29.861
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

06:30.072 --> 06:31.972
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

06:32.575 --> 06:35.043
It's a known fact
that women love babies.

06:35.244 --> 06:38.907
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

06:39.915 --> 06:43.749
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

06:44.420 --> 06:47.719
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.821
-Give me the baby.
-No, I got him.

06:50.059 --> 06:51.219
Come on, seriously.

06:51.427 --> 06:53.361
Oh, seriously, you want him?

06:58.034 --> 06:59.592
Who is this little cutie-pie?

07:00.069 --> 07:02.731
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

07:02.938 --> 07:04.405
... me.

07:05.841 --> 07:06.773
Want to smell him?

07:07.009 --> 07:09.102
I assume we're talking about the baby?

07:11.781 --> 07:15.080
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.184
My uterus just skipped a beat.

07:20.423 --> 07:21.583
What'd I tell you?

07:21.857 --> 07:23.347
It's great you're doing this.

07:23.759 --> 07:25.727
Well, we are great guys.

07:25.961 --> 07:29.055
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

07:29.298 --> 07:31.732
What agency did you two go through?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.930
But this is my gig.

07:38.140 --> 07:39.607
This is where I play.

07:39.809 --> 07:42.300
My name is written out there in chalk.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.275
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.878
Honey, I'm sorry.

07:50.152 --> 07:52.416
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

07:52.621 --> 07:55.488
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

07:55.758 --> 08:00.695
And, like, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

08:01.564 --> 08:05.125
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

08:05.401 --> 08:07.801
That's where that came from.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.064
You probably did everything you could.

08:14.310 --> 08:18.269
You know what? Let me just
see what else I could do.

08:21.117 --> 08:24.086
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.652
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.518
I don't know.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.623
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

08:30.826 --> 08:33.192
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

08:34.830 --> 08:37.628
Of course I clean it.

08:37.867 --> 08:40.597
I mean, I will clean it.

08:40.803 --> 08:42.361
I mean, I will clean it.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.506
All right, fine, fine, fine!

08:50.513 --> 08:51.878
-Done.
-Really?

08:52.114 --> 08:53.638
Who's working for you, babe?

08:54.350 --> 08:58.980
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

08:59.188 --> 09:00.212
What?

09:00.990 --> 09:03.288
He's paying the people
who were playing.

09:04.326 --> 09:09.229
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

09:09.698 --> 09:12.633
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.633
I'm sorry, no!

09:16.038 --> 09:20.372
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

09:20.576 --> 09:23.067
There are thousands of places
in this city...

09:23.345 --> 09:26.041
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

09:26.248 --> 09:28.182
When I play, I play for me

09:28.384 --> 09:30.409
I don't need your charity

09:30.653 --> 09:32.086
Thank you!

09:40.262 --> 09:43.595
I'm not getting a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle...

09:43.833 --> 09:47.496
...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

09:53.103 --> 09:55.401
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

09:55.906 --> 09:59.569
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

09:59.844 --> 10:02.278
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

10:04.415 --> 10:08.181
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

10:08.419 --> 10:11.252
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

10:12.890 --> 10:15.256
My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

10:15.459 --> 10:18.121
...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

10:18.929 --> 10:23.229
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

10:24.235 --> 10:25.429
So?

10:28.038 --> 10:31.769
Go and have a seat. The doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

10:31.976 --> 10:36.743
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

10:39.817 --> 10:42.786
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

10:44.555 --> 10:46.489
You want to squeeze my hand?

10:47.424 --> 10:49.449
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.185
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

10:52.396 --> 10:54.159
Let go of my hand!

10:57.768 --> 11:00.259
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

11:00.504 --> 11:02.972
...we should go to
the park and make out.

11:03.474 --> 11:04.998
Taxi! Taxi!

11:07.244 --> 11:08.506
Look at that talent.

11:11.949 --> 11:14.008
Just practicing. You're good.

11:14.251 --> 11:15.479
Carry on.

11:16.186 --> 11:17.778
Wait, wait, wait!

11:18.422 --> 11:21.585
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

11:21.792 --> 11:26.024
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

11:27.598 --> 11:30.965
-What are you guys out doing today?
-We're not out.

11:32.603 --> 11:35.538
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

11:35.773 --> 11:40.301
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

11:41.378 --> 11:42.606
You done?

11:43.814 --> 11:44.838
There's our stop.

11:45.616 --> 11:48.210
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

11:48.452 --> 11:50.317
You guys live around here too?

11:50.654 --> 11:53.452
We live in the building
by the sidewalk.

11:55.793 --> 11:57.192
You know it?

11:58.495 --> 12:02.556
Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

12:07.504 --> 12:09.699
So you want to go to Markel's?

12:10.641 --> 12:12.165
Sure, they love us over there.

12:12.810 --> 12:14.072
Where's your baby?

12:20.089 --> 12:22.216
Ben! Ben!

12:22.691 --> 12:26.149
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

12:26.395 --> 12:27.862
Stop the bus!

12:36.972 --> 12:39.372
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It's really hurt.

12:39.574 --> 12:42.737
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

12:43.645 --> 12:47.513
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.212
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay.

12:51.420 --> 12:52.717
Sorry.

12:53.221 --> 12:56.679
Sorry! I got my S's back!

12:57.392 --> 13:00.020
Which we can celebrate later.

13:00.662 --> 13:02.721
Celebrate. Celebrate....

13:03.865 --> 13:05.696
He was a double, double

13:05.901 --> 13:08.836
Double-jointed boy

13:10.572 --> 13:14.531
So are you the
professional guitar player?

13:15.077 --> 13:16.601
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

13:17.279 --> 13:21.113
Right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

13:23.852 --> 13:26.514
So how many chords do you know?

13:27.189 --> 13:29.555
-All of them.
-So you know D?

13:31.693 --> 13:32.853
Do you know A-minor?

13:35.964 --> 13:38.524
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

13:42.871 --> 13:45.704
So does your guitar have a strap?

13:48.777 --> 13:49.903
Mine does.

13:53.715 --> 13:55.876
Stephanie knows all the chords

13:58.487 --> 14:00.284
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

14:01.990 --> 14:03.617
Transit Authority?

14:04.426 --> 14:06.087
I'm doing research for a book.

14:06.294 --> 14:10.924
I was wondering what somebody might do
if they left a baby on a city bus.

14:12.267 --> 14:14.929
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

14:15.137 --> 14:17.765
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

14:17.973 --> 14:21.409
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.441
And there was a baby in it.

14:24.813 --> 14:26.075
He wants to talk to you.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.416
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to

14:31.620 --> 14:34.453
Terry's a jerk
And he won't let me work

14:34.656 --> 14:36.590
And I hate Central Perk

14:41.263 --> 14:43.697
To Stephanie Schiffer!

14:48.804 --> 14:53.264
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.771
Zachary

14:58.346 --> 15:01.144
Are all invited to bite me

15:10.625 --> 15:13.958
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

15:14.830 --> 15:16.388
He's here.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.558
I assume one of you is the father.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.303
-That's me.
-I'm him.

15:24.906 --> 15:29.138
Actually, we're both the father.

15:38.053 --> 15:40.521
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

15:46.928 --> 15:49.396
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

15:51.032 --> 15:54.001
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

15:54.202 --> 15:56.261
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

15:56.505 --> 15:58.166
Or clowns.

16:00.008 --> 16:04.377
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

16:04.846 --> 16:07.508
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

16:08.283 --> 16:10.251
Okay, the mole came off.

16:11.586 --> 16:13.679
What are we gonna do?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.721
We'll flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.

16:16.925 --> 16:19.052
-Flip for the baby?
-You got a better idea?

16:19.361 --> 16:21.261
All right, call it in the air.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.856
Heads.

16:24.065 --> 16:25.293
Heads, it is.

16:28.303 --> 16:31.101
We have to assign heads to something!

16:32.207 --> 16:33.572
Right!

16:36.311 --> 16:40.042
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

16:44.619 --> 16:47.952
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

17:25.963 --> 17:30.332
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

17:30.568 --> 17:35.301
Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby

17:35.506 --> 17:38.634
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

17:40.311 --> 17:43.439
Then slowly turn away

17:45.182 --> 17:48.583
I won't beg you to stay

17:49.253 --> 17:51.687
With me

19:46.666 --> 19:49.362
Here. I thought you might be cold.

19:49.568 --> 19:50.796
Thank you.

19:58.344 --> 20:00.141
Look at you!
You did pretty well.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.574
$8. 27.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.483
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

20:07.887 --> 20:12.085
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

20:12.658 --> 20:13.750
Do you?

20:15.695 --> 20:19.392
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

20:20.499 --> 20:23.593
I don't know, when l
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

20:25.004 --> 20:28.565
... I got, like, $ 1. 75.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.872
But then "Smelly Cat"?

20:32.745 --> 20:35.612
I got 25 cents and a condom.

20:37.116 --> 20:40.847
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat."

20:43.456 --> 20:47.552
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat."

20:47.760 --> 20:52.697
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

20:54.800 --> 20:57.132
But it's not even that, you know?

20:57.370 --> 21:00.203
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

21:00.406 --> 21:04.308
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

21:06.979 --> 21:09.140
Well, people missed you in there.

21:09.415 --> 21:12.543
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat."

21:12.952 --> 21:14.419
Really? From who?

21:14.987 --> 21:16.249
Well, me.

21:17.990 --> 21:22.120
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

21:25.998 --> 21:29.832
Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

21:33.606 --> 21:35.733
It's kind of an emergency.

21:36.976 --> 21:38.443
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot.

21:38.677 --> 21:40.907
Hey, Christine! I got it!

21:47.186 --> 21:50.087
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

21:50.289 --> 21:52.621
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand.

21:52.825 --> 21:56.591
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

21:57.596 --> 22:00.793
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

22:01.167 --> 22:05.365
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

22:06.439 --> 22:10.205
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

22:10.476 --> 22:13.001
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

22:13.279 --> 22:15.509
...and you hit your head on the curb?

22:17.183 --> 22:19.515
But I remember
people telling me about it.

22:21.353 --> 22:23.344
I hope Ben has a little sister.

22:25.157 --> 22:27.125
And I hope she can kick his ass.

22:28.694 --> 22:30.525
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

22:31.530 --> 22:34.397
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

22:35.201 --> 22:36.498
That was you?

22:39.071 --> 22:42.165
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

22:46.312 --> 22:47.677
My little nephew.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.541
Come here, little one!

22:50.349 --> 22:54.308
There's my little baby, Ben!

22:58.257 --> 23:00.589
Hey, he's not crying!

23:04.396 --> 23:06.830
Hey, he's not crying!

23:12.838 --> 23:14.931
There's still pie!

23:15.875 --> 23:18.105
I'm here. I'm here.

23:18.844 --> 23:20.835
How's my little boy?

23:21.280 --> 23:25.410
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

23:26.285 --> 23:30.517
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

23:31.090 --> 23:33.558
He rode the bus today.

23:37.229 --> 23:39.959
Big boy riding the bus

23:40.900 --> 23:42.697
Hey, I have a question.

23:45.271 --> 23:48.297
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

23:53.312 --> 23:55.803
You are gonna love this.

23:56.649 --> 23:58.139
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

23:59.051 --> 23:59.983
Come here. Come here.

24:00.252 --> 24:03.312
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

24:09.061 --> 24:12.394
Smelly cat, smelly cat

24:12.631 --> 24:14.724
What are they feeding you?

24:15.534 --> 24:16.523
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

24:16.735 --> 24:19.898
Smelly cat, smelly cat

24:24.310 --> 24:28.007
Smelly cat, smelly cat

24:28.647 --> 24:29.671
Better!

24:29.882 --> 24:30.974
Much better. Good.

24:31.183 --> 24:33.845
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

24:36.088 --> 24:38.488
-You want to try it again?
-From the top?

24:38.691 --> 24:41.319
There is no "top," all right?

24:41.994 --> 24:44.087
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."

24:47.366 --> 24:49.231
Why don't you just follow me.

24:50.402 --> 24:53.997
Smelly cat, smelly cat

24:54.240 --> 24:57.038
What are they feeding you?

24:57.610 --> 25:00.738
Smelly cat, smelly cat

25:00.946 --> 25:04.040
It's not your fault

25:04.850 --> 25:07.182
That's too much. Sorry.
