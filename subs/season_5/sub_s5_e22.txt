WEBVTT

00:14.848 --> 00:16.110
What's going on?

00:16.316 --> 00:18.409
My eye is a little itchy.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.280
Mine too. Yeah.

00:23.156 --> 00:26.319
It's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.824
I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.691
That's all I hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.695
Since we've dated,
I've said his name twice.

00:35.935 --> 00:37.800
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.172
It's not Richard.
It's this new guy. He's good.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.002
I'm sorry. I'm not going
to an eye doctor.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.305
-Oh, God. Here we go.
-What?

00:48.481 --> 00:52.178
Anytime anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

00:52.385 --> 00:54.444
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.319
Ross, come on!

00:56.556 --> 01:00.117
I have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?

01:02.962 --> 01:06.557
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
"Me, Myself and Eye."

01:06.866 --> 01:08.333
Monica! Come on!

01:08.535 --> 01:11.402
All those in favor
of getting lunch, say, "eye."

01:11.638 --> 01:13.071
Ross! Stop it!

01:13.306 --> 01:16.173
How much did I love
The King and Eye?

01:16.376 --> 01:17.365
Chandler!

01:17.544 --> 01:18.533
Me too, me too!

01:18.745 --> 01:20.975
Just stop it! That's enough!

01:22.549 --> 01:25.541
-You okay there, man?
-Yeah. I got too excited.

01:27.554 --> 01:31.422
The One with Joey's Big Break

02:15.135 --> 02:17.330
I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.

02:17.537 --> 02:20.631
-Give him a kiss for me.
-All right. Bye.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.472
Later.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.876
I'm so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

02:26.112 --> 02:29.843
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.017
Calm down?

02:36.656 --> 02:39.454
I'm trying.
Man, that guy can push my buttons!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.291
Why are you so mad?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.457
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-lt seems like

02:45.665 --> 02:48.133
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

02:49.802 --> 02:52.327
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?

02:53.306 --> 02:54.796
No. What's it look like?

02:55.041 --> 02:58.010
-A piece of paper and it says, "Ross."
-I see.

03:01.748 --> 03:04.808
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.485
I got the lead!

03:06.986 --> 03:09.648
You got the lead in a movie?
What's it about?

03:09.889 --> 03:13.086
It's called Shutterspeed.
It's really cool.

03:13.359 --> 03:17.386
I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day.

03:17.664 --> 03:21.532
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.

03:21.768 --> 03:25.033
This old lady answers the door.
I say, "Where's Betsy?"

03:25.338 --> 03:30.241
And she says, "Betsy's been dead
for 10 years."

03:32.912 --> 03:33.901
Chilling!

03:34.113 --> 03:37.742
The best part is, we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.076
-You know what that means.
-I know.

03:40.286 --> 03:44.086
Road trip! We can rent a car.
I have to be there by Tuesday.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.115
Wait! My grandmother's dead.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.057
We can talk about that too, Phoebe.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.257
No, her cab.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.597
She probably won't be using it.
Drive it to Las Vegas.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.296
All right! Thanks!

04:01.574 --> 04:04.407
What are we gonna do about my job?

04:04.744 --> 04:05.802
Not go.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.603
Great! Road trip, baby!

04:09.115 --> 04:10.104
Is this okay?

04:10.383 --> 04:13.750
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.909
You can go.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.823
Rach, we'll be late
for the eye doctor.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.754
All right. Let's get this over with.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.459
Look what I did.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.235
I mean, look at this mess.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.908
We're gonna probably have to
clean this up.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.668
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!

04:40.813 --> 04:44.943
If you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong!

04:45.184 --> 04:47.015
All right, let's go, Blinky.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.630
Hey, Joey. What's up?

05:01.467 --> 05:04.334
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.437
You've traveled a lot, right?

05:06.673 --> 05:08.300
Yeah, I've been around.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.841
Which route should I take?
The north or the south route?

05:12.045 --> 05:15.640
If you take the north route,
there's a man with a beard of bees.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.316
Great! Problem solved!

05:20.787 --> 05:24.518
On the south route, there's a chicken
that plays tic-tac-toe.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.017
Well, back to square one.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.829
I know a way that you can decide.

05:31.064 --> 05:35.296
I'll ask you a series of questions
and you answer as quickly as you can.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.627
Yes!

05:36.869 --> 05:37.961
Good. But wait.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.164
Here we go. I want you to relax.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.369
Take a deep breath.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.737
Clear your mind.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.243
-Peanut butter or egg whites?
-Peanut butter.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.642
-Be a fireman or a swimmer?
-Swimmer.

05:51.884 --> 05:55.411
-You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?
-Monica.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.721
I always thought it'd be Rachel.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.553
-No thinking. Tie or ascot?
-Ascot.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.228
-North or south route?
-North.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.727
Bam! There you go! Huh?

06:06.432 --> 06:10.391
That was incredible!
Beard of bees here I come!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.197
This guy again.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.206
Hey, what's up?

06:19.445 --> 06:21.743
Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?

06:21.948 --> 06:23.347
What do you wanna see?

06:23.616 --> 06:24.674
I don't know.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.442
I know how to decide.
Show him your game.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.177
No, thank you.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.248
What's with her?

06:32.458 --> 06:34.585
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.922
I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.755
-Action or comedy?
-Action.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.764
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

06:47.206 --> 06:49.197
Dude, you are sick.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.610
I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.216
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.627
-An eye removal machine.
-I'm out of here.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.455
I'm kidding.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.324
Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.795
Monica said you were nervous.
Everything will be fine.

07:16.035 --> 07:19.198
-So we're done.
-Almost, but first we gotta start.

07:19.539 --> 07:22.599
This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.941
Put your chin here.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.875
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.343
What?

07:31.984 --> 07:35.112
A small puff of air.
Now, come on!

07:36.889 --> 07:38.220
Here we go.

07:38.691 --> 07:42.183
One, two, three.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.196
I'm sorry. All right.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.026
I'm gonna stay in here this time.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.323
Ready?

07:49.535 --> 07:52.504
-One, two
-I'm sorry.

07:52.705 --> 07:55.299
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.008
That's okay.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.041
I'm sorry.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.547
You're young.
You don't have glaucoma.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.882
So it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.219
What are you?
Are you crazy?

08:15.661 --> 08:19.188
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

08:19.432 --> 08:23.095
Take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.566
No, I don't put things in my eye.

08:26.205 --> 08:30.505
We'll see you here in three months.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.337
Give me the damn drops!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.542
Dr. Miller?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.516
P-E-C-F-D.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.520
Very good, Monica!

08:44.257 --> 08:46.782
-You know where they are.
-I sure do.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.461
And you don't get one.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.604
You know, those eye drops
are a miracle.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.636
My eye is 100 percent better.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.138
-They're still in my coat.
-Damn!

09:05.978 --> 09:07.036
You ready to go?

09:07.246 --> 09:11.205
How cold will it be there?
Will all these sweater vests be enough?

09:12.985 --> 09:14.612
-What?
-I love you.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.922
I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'll miss him.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.959
Thanks. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.

09:24.430 --> 09:27.456
Is the movie putting us up
in a big hotel suite?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.794
Not really.
It's an independent film.

09:30.002 --> 09:33.096
We don't have a big budget.
I'll stay in your room.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.968
Once you get paid,
you'll be springing for a suite.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.235
They must be paying you a lot.

09:40.479 --> 09:43.471
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...

09:43.783 --> 09:46.911
...one penny of it goes
right in Joey's pocket.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.085
You don't get paid unless
it makes money?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.782
Did you not hear the plot
of the movie?

09:54.460 --> 09:57.759
"She's been dead for 10 years."

09:57.964 --> 10:00.023
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

10:02.435 --> 10:04.027
I wanted to say goodbye.

10:04.303 --> 10:07.602
And to see if you guys would
place a little bet for me.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.171
Twenty bucks on black 15.

10:10.376 --> 10:11.934
-You got it!
-All right.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.916
-You remember the number, right?
-Yeah, black 13.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.178
-Black 15!
-You got it.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.821
-All right. Bye-bye, now.
-Bye, you guys.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.683
I'll say bye at the car.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.155
Anyone wanna say bye to me
at the car?

10:30.363 --> 10:34.493
I'll say goodbye to you at the car
if you don't mind the pus.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.958
See you!

10:38.871 --> 10:42.773
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
It means it's healing.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.005
Hey, Phoebe. What you reading?

10:54.887 --> 10:56.115
Hello?

11:03.629 --> 11:04.789
Come on!

11:05.031 --> 11:06.794
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.068
Phoebe, are you mad at me
or something?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.862
If you are, please tell me
what it is I did.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.803
-lf you don't know, I can't help you.
-I don't know.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.875
Well, I can't help you.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.642
Well, whatever it is,
I am very, very sorry. Okay?

11:26.886 --> 11:28.046
Apology accepted.

11:30.389 --> 11:31.549
So we're good?

11:37.063 --> 11:38.690
I'll see you later, okay?

11:38.898 --> 11:39.922
Bye, fat-ass.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.599
All right!

11:43.102 --> 11:46.833
Will you please tell me what it is
that made you so mad at me?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.872
I don't know! I don't remember!

11:50.910 --> 11:52.969
What do you mean, you can't remember?

11:53.145 --> 11:57.946
I was so focused on being mad at you,
I forgot what it was I was mad about.

11:59.185 --> 12:02.518
If you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.953
Oh, no. I am mad at you.
I know that much.

12:06.225 --> 12:11.128
But I'm sorry about the fat-ass thing
because you have a sweet, little heinie.

12:19.905 --> 12:23.671
I'm getting pretty tired.
You'll have to take over soon.

12:24.076 --> 12:28.240
We've been driving for a half-hour.
You haven't looked at the road once.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.982
Don't worry. It's out there.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.350
Maybe I just need lunch.
You wanna eat?

12:36.021 --> 12:37.579
My treat.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.556
Isn't that Ross' money?

12:42.995 --> 12:45.395
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

12:45.664 --> 12:46.756
I don't know.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.694
I know how we can decide.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.835
I'll ask you questions.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.503
And then you have to answer real fast.

12:53.739 --> 12:57.175
So clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

12:57.710 --> 13:02.409
It's all clear except for this image
of a small, purple lamp.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.106
Is that all right if that stays in there?

13:05.885 --> 13:08.285
I don't see why not. I guess.

13:08.454 --> 13:12.356
You have to answer with the first thing
that pops into your head, okay?

13:12.558 --> 13:14.185
-Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
-Too dry.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.550
-Do you believe in ghosts?
-No.

13:16.762 --> 13:18.923
-Will this movie be my big break?
-No.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.059
-What?
-Yes.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.868
-Dude, you said, no.
-I also said, yes.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.768
-This won't be my big break?
-No.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.212
I don't believe this.

13:34.513 --> 13:38.005
Look, I just don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

13:38.217 --> 13:41.209
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie!

13:41.420 --> 13:45.584
They're not even paying you!
This doesn't sound like a real movie!

13:45.858 --> 13:48.850
I don't know why you're dumping
all over my big break.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.858
I don't think this is gonna be
your big break.

13:52.064 --> 13:54.794
Are you on this trip
to make me feel like a loser?

13:55.134 --> 13:57.898
-I'd rather be alone.
-You don't want me here?

13:58.103 --> 13:59.468
Not if you're like this.

13:59.705 --> 14:02.731
The next time you ask me
a question like that, I'll lie.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.703
I don't want you on the trip.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.435
Why don't you pull over.
I'll get out now.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.203
Fine.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.639
Get out.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.648
You can't stop on a bridge.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.718
-Get out!
-Fine!

14:19.792 --> 14:22.158
Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!

14:22.394 --> 14:24.828
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.498
Are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.740
Because I said your handwriting
is childlike?

14:36.942 --> 14:39.274
No. That made me feel precious.

14:40.179 --> 14:43.114
Because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

14:43.349 --> 14:46.512
"Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!

14:48.087 --> 14:49.952
Yeah? Sometimes it's:

14:52.992 --> 14:57.053
Did you beat him at a board game?
He's such a baby when he loses.

14:57.263 --> 14:58.525
Okay, I'm the baby.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.423
Hey! Stop it!

15:02.534 --> 15:04.195
What are you doing here?

15:04.470 --> 15:06.836
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.132
-Why?
-I don't know. He went crazy.

15:09.341 --> 15:12.868
We played that game where you
ask questions and answer fast.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.513
That game should not be played
without my supervision.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.373
I don't know what made him mad.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.519
All I said was that
this wouldn't be his big break...

15:22.788 --> 15:24.949
...that it wouldn't do
anything for him...

15:25.157 --> 15:26.886
...and that it didn't sound real.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.890
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.153
What's in the bag?

15:31.363 --> 15:32.990
I figured you'd be mad at me...

15:33.232 --> 15:36.065
...so I got gifts that I found
on the roadside.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.059
-Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?
-I do!

15:48.981 --> 15:52.439
-Not even close.
-I need help! I can't do this.

15:52.651 --> 15:53.982
Come on. Let's do it.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.145
Sit down.
All right, put your head back.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.521
-Now open your eyes.
-Okay, they are.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.864
-How many fingers am I holding up?
-Four.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.328
I was thinking four.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.627
-Really?
-Yes!

16:10.869 --> 16:13.838
Why don't we start
with a practice one.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.337
-No drops.
-Great!

16:17.009 --> 16:21.309
On three. One, two, three.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.645
My pillow's all wet!

16:23.849 --> 16:25.840
Well, you said it was practice!

16:26.051 --> 16:27.143
Why did you move?

16:27.386 --> 16:28.717
I knew you were lying!

16:31.457 --> 16:33.322
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

16:33.559 --> 16:35.618
Stop it! Oh, my God!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.693
I am going....

16:37.963 --> 16:39.726
Turn it over!

16:39.999 --> 16:41.899
I am going to get...

16:43.369 --> 16:45.030
...get these drops in your eye.

16:45.237 --> 16:48.502
Oh, my God! You really are
freakishly strong.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.399
Stop! Stop!

16:51.677 --> 16:53.144
Stop it!

16:54.513 --> 16:56.140
Damn, it's empty!

16:56.715 --> 17:00.481
If Joey and Chandler walked in now,
we could make a fortune.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.385
That is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.018
Or Rachel.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.866
It's Joey.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.733
Chandler told me what happened.
He's really upset.

17:22.207 --> 17:26.769
Not as upset as he'll be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.246
What did you do to them?

17:30.449 --> 17:33.111
There's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.391
I gotta ask Phoebe
something about the car.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.058
Hold on one second.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.785
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, Phoebe.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.055
This wooden box keeps sliding out.
What is it?

17:47.232 --> 17:48.290
My grandma.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.637
And thanks.
She's having a great time.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.641
Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.539
Chandler's here.
He was wondering if

18:02.781 --> 18:05.648
I guess he ran out of change.

18:06.385 --> 18:10.287
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

18:10.489 --> 18:14.619
Send him something. So when he
gets there, he'll know you're sorry.

18:14.827 --> 18:19.230
That's a good idea. I wonder where
I could get a basket of porn?

18:20.666 --> 18:22.896
No, don't say, "I'm sorry," with porn.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.570
You should send him
a carton of cigarettes.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.899
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.404
No. That's prison.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.780
I know how we're gonna
figure this out.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.244
Clear your mind...

18:39.485 --> 18:42.943
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.686
-Do you like flora or fauna?
-Fauna.

18:46.925 --> 18:48.449
-Simon or Garfunkel?
-Garfunkel.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.285
-Why are you mad?
-You said I was boring.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.789
When did I say that?

18:56.034 --> 18:59.094
Oh, my God! I remember now!
We were playing chess.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.273
Phoebe, you and l
have never played chess.

19:02.474 --> 19:07.639
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.

19:07.846 --> 19:11.782
Then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.355
There's a chance this
may have been a dream.

19:20.392 --> 19:26.922
So this entire time, you've been
angry with me because of a dream?

19:27.199 --> 19:30.327
Well, guess what, now I'm mad at you.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.533
I wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.538
Otherwise we're wasting our time.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.401
Stanley!

20:09.975 --> 20:12.535
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.478
Slight change of plans.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.146
We've shut down.

20:17.082 --> 20:18.344
What? Why?

20:18.550 --> 20:21.041
It's a money thing.
We don't have any.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.245
You're kidding, right?

20:26.091 --> 20:27.080
What?

20:27.459 --> 20:29.654
It's probably just temporary.

20:29.928 --> 20:33.227
We're hoping to get some money soon.
Just hang out.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.399
Hang out? How long?

20:35.634 --> 20:39.297
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money will turn up.

20:39.504 --> 20:42.940
People always wanna invest in movies.
You're not rich?

20:43.909 --> 20:44.933
Worth a shot.

20:46.812 --> 20:50.077
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?

20:52.651 --> 20:55.313
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.020
These got left for you.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.848
Thanks.

21:00.158 --> 21:03.616
"Congratulations on your big break."

21:36.094 --> 21:38.654
-Monica, it's Joey.
-Hey, Joey.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.297
You remember me
even though you're a star.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.799
Come on. It'll be years
before I forget you.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.606
What's it like on a movie set?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.934
Do you have a dressing room
and a chair with your name?

21:52.177 --> 21:54.805
Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.948
Tell Chandler he couldn't
have been more wrong.

21:58.183 --> 22:01.584
I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.

22:05.924 --> 22:08.154
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting.

22:09.294 --> 22:10.659
Everybody smile.

22:13.031 --> 22:17.968
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay
at Caesars. We hope it's toga-rific.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.139
Kill me. Kill me now.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.873
Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?

22:30.248 --> 22:31.476
Go!

22:31.750 --> 22:35.277
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!

22:35.487 --> 22:37.114
Hold it open. Okay.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.286
We'll see you in about
three or four hours.
