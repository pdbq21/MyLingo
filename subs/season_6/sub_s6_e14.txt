WEBVTT

00:04.637 --> 00:06.127
Oh! Hey, Rach.

00:06.406 --> 00:09.967
I was just coming over here to...

00:10.443 --> 00:13.537
Wait, I don't have to lie to you,
you don't live here anymore.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.442
I'm eating their food.
You?

00:16.883 --> 00:21.479
Ross is on a date with my sister.
They shut the drapes two hours ago.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.383
I didn't know we could
date your sister.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.159
We know you steal our food.

00:31.498 --> 00:32.726
I'm good.

00:33.666 --> 00:34.997
Drapes still closed?

00:35.201 --> 00:38.796
Yeah. That perverted couple
two doors over should've shut theirs.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.496
-Is that a swing?
-Oh, don't even ask.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.812
I can't believe Ross
is with her sister.

00:48.081 --> 00:50.914
When Chandler kissed my sister,
I was mad for 10 years.

00:51.584 --> 00:54.917
-That was five years ago.
-You got five years left.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.088
-Joey..
-Want to make it six?

00:59.225 --> 01:01.591
The One Where Chandler Can't Cry

01:38.264 --> 01:41.495
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you?
There you are.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.403
Can I get a cup of coffee?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.567
So how was your big date last night?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.271
It was okay. It was fun.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.844
It was fun?
Great.

01:56.883 --> 02:00.114
So did you guys hit it off?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.851
I guess so.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.291
So did anything happen?
Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.291
No. No. Nothing happened.

02:11.564 --> 02:15.056
I shut the drapes to show her
slides of my favorite fossils.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.535
Oh, slides!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.408
So really nothing happened.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.905
Something could've happened.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.205
She really dug my slides.

02:28.414 --> 02:32.214
And she was definitely
giving me the vibe.

02:32.652 --> 02:37.055
Was it the "Please don't show me
another picture of a trilobite" vibe?

02:37.390 --> 02:40.450
I'm telling you,
she was in to me, okay?

02:40.627 --> 02:44.961
Hey, you remembered trilobite.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.125
Anyway...

02:47.500 --> 02:50.469
If she wasn't into me,
why would she ask me out again?

02:50.670 --> 02:53.002
-She asked you out again?
-Yeah.

02:54.240 --> 02:59.610
Tomorrow night. Valentine's Day.
The most romantic day of the year.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.507
Who knows what could happen.

03:01.781 --> 03:05.342
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my slides.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.142
Okay! I got it, I got it.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.184
I can't go with the "you
and my sister" thing.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.482
It's just too weird, all right?

03:12.759 --> 03:14.954
I imagine the two of you together.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.686
It just freaks me out.
I can't do it!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.134
It's okay.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.429
It's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.

03:26.606 --> 03:27.630
Thank you.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.273
After tomorrow night.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.477
No! I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out!

03:32.712 --> 03:34.202
Okay, okay, okay!

03:35.348 --> 03:39.876
Okay. I'll tell her tonight
I can't see her anymore.

03:40.186 --> 03:41.710
Ross, thanks.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.688
Want me to call her now?

03:44.958 --> 03:47.791
Oh, no. No, no, no.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.023
No. Come on, I mean, that's crazy.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.859
So, what's going on with you?

03:56.502 --> 03:57.560
Well...

03:57.837 --> 04:00.499
I may teach another class
this semester.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.401
Do it now. Call her now.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.813
-This is my favorite part.
-Me too.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.089
I don't know what you guys
are so sad about. It all works out.

04:18.258 --> 04:24.060
E.T. stays with Elliott, and they get to
be best friends forever.

04:24.230 --> 04:27.028
You've seen this movie before,
E.T. goes back home.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.168
What?

04:32.305 --> 04:35.035
Oh, no, I forgot.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.470
You know what's sadder
than this? Bambi.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.242
I cried for three days
with that movie. No, two.

04:43.516 --> 04:47.680
The third day my mom killed herself,
so I was partly crying for that.

04:49.522 --> 04:53.686
Well, that I can see crying
over, but Bambi is a cartoon.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.655
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?

04:55.862 --> 04:59.491
Yes, it was very sad when the guy
stopped drawing the deer.

05:01.534 --> 05:06.767
If this movie's making you guys cry
so much, let's just change the channel.

05:06.939 --> 05:07.997
There.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.441
Joey, you're crying
over a Doritos commercial.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.640
I was up for that part.

05:19.118 --> 05:22.918
It's okay to cry. You don't
have to be macho all the time.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.783
I'm not macho.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.819
Yeah, you're right.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.557
I don't know what I was thinking.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.829
I just never really cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.

05:34.100 --> 05:39.060
Come on, there's gotta be something
that gets you choked up. Like...

05:39.339 --> 05:41.603
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.406
I'd be sad, sure.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.169
But I wouldn't cry.

05:47.447 --> 05:51.247
What if the puppy said,
"Help me, Chandler.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.854
All the other puppies pick on me."

05:56.489 --> 05:59.822
Cry? I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich!

06:02.328 --> 06:04.353
I've got it. I have got it.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.428
Pictures from your childhood.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.894
This'll get you going good.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.866
Oh, what's going on there?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.005
Parents' Day. First grade.

06:14.273 --> 06:17.868
That's me with the janitor, Martin.

06:18.344 --> 06:21.006
-Where are your parents?
-They didn't want to come.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.281
-Chandler!
-Poor thing.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.574
That story doesn't make you cry?

06:25.785 --> 06:28.948
No. Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.452
No! It's not okay!

06:31.724 --> 06:33.453
It's not okay at all!

06:34.861 --> 06:36.089
You're dead inside!

06:40.867 --> 06:42.300
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

06:42.568 --> 06:44.798
-Are you Phoebe Buffay?
-Yeah.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.399
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.371
My biggest fan?
I've always wanted to meet you.

06:52.779 --> 06:53.768
Sure. Yeah.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.946
Wow. Wow, thanks a lot.

06:56.215 --> 06:59.241
I just want to say,
I think you're really talented.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.216
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.621
Take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.426
Bye.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.833
So you saw me
on Days of Our Lives, huh?

07:16.469 --> 07:19.996
You want me to do a little
Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?

07:23.843 --> 07:26.334
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.012
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's
autograph.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.079
Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.411
Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.

07:35.988 --> 07:40.322
-Movies?
-That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.027
I don't think so.

07:47.300 --> 07:51.293
No, it was. She was in
Sex Toy Story Two...

07:51.871 --> 07:53.839
Lawrence of a Labia.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.333
And I got her autograph.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.475
The guys at the comic book store
won't believe this.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.140
Gunther?

08:05.351 --> 08:09.287
Don't let that guy in here anymore.
He said Phoebe's a porn star.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.823
Well, I wouldn't call her a star,
but she's really good.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.054
You should check out
Inspect Her Gadget.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.700
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:23.970 --> 08:28.168
Ross just totally blew me off,
and he didn't even tell me why.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.201
Oh, well.

08:30.676 --> 08:34.874
The best thing to do to get over a guy
is to start dating someone else.

08:35.181 --> 08:39.447
Oh! There is this great guy you
will just love at work, named Bob.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.678
He's a real up-and-comer
in Human Resources.

08:43.456 --> 08:47.916
Maybe I talk too much, or maybe I
should have been more aggressive sexually.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.085
No, no, no.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.823
No, that would never
have worked on Ross.

08:52.999 --> 08:56.594
But you know who that might work on?
Bob in Human Resources.

08:57.503 --> 09:01.269
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.907
Not random. Bob.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.841
It's probably because I'm not
mature enough or smart enough...

09:09.148 --> 09:11.309
Maybe he doesn't
like the way I dress.

09:11.517 --> 09:15.009
No, that can't be it.
It's gotta be the smart thing.

09:15.788 --> 09:20.521
I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like,
incredibly pretty, stupid girl.

09:21.527 --> 09:22.789
No, honey.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.119
Okay.

09:25.364 --> 09:28.822
Okay. You want to know why Ross
canceled the date?

09:29.135 --> 09:30.932
Because I asked him to.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.435
You asked him to?

09:33.639 --> 09:36.335
-Why?
-Because you are my sister...

09:36.542 --> 09:39.136
and Ross and I have
this huge history.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.108
-You want to go out with Ross?
-No.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.474
You don't want him,
but you don't want me to have him?

09:45.551 --> 09:48.281
You know, Bob in Human Resources...

09:48.721 --> 09:52.817
I can't believe you did this!
You had me doubting how smart I was!

09:53.025 --> 09:55.493
You had me doubting my fashion sense!

09:55.795 --> 09:59.629
It's not that big a deal. Just
don't date Ross. There's other..

09:59.865 --> 10:02.390
You have no right
to tell me what to do.

10:02.668 --> 10:06.399
I'm not telling you what to do.
I am telling you what not to do!

10:07.506 --> 10:09.303
Why are you so jealous of me?

10:09.542 --> 10:11.567
This is not about me being jealous.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.870
It's about you being a brat,
wanting what you can't have.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.412
Can't have?

10:16.682 --> 10:19.810
Excuse me. The only thing
I can't have is dairy!

10:22.321 --> 10:25.188
Well, you just blew your chances
at dating Bob!

10:25.391 --> 10:27.359
-Who?
-With Human Resources!

10:30.029 --> 10:33.521
Jealous of her? Who does she think
she is, Princess Caroline?

10:34.900 --> 10:38.893
-You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
-Do I have my own castle?

10:40.740 --> 10:41.866
Hey.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.769
-Phoebe's not here, is she?
-No.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.101
Did you get a movie?

10:52.952 --> 10:54.112
Yeah. Yeah.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.787
But I don't think it's the kind
you're gonna like.

10:59.358 --> 11:03.385
Not more movies that'll have us
reaching for the tissues all night?

11:08.968 --> 11:10.595
Sort of.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.364
What's going on?

11:15.408 --> 11:17.899
Phoebe's a porn star!

11:18.210 --> 11:19.438
-What?
-Yeah!

11:19.645 --> 11:21.636
What are you talking about?

11:22.448 --> 11:26.942
"Phoebe Buffay in
Buffay The Vampire Layer."

11:28.954 --> 11:31.320
That's Phoebe.
Where did you get that?

11:31.590 --> 11:33.990
At the adult video place on Bleecker.

11:34.226 --> 11:38.890
And I saw Joey was about to go in,
so I ran in ahead of him...

11:39.165 --> 11:42.498
to surprise him.

11:42.768 --> 11:46.898
Then I pretended that I didn't
know he was in there.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.177
Wow. I mean,
I just can't believe this.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.676
I mean, you think you know someone.

11:55.981 --> 11:59.246
Even Phoebe, who's always been
somewhat of a question mark.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.579
This is so bizarre.

12:02.822 --> 12:06.280
I guess it makes sense.
She had such a terrible childhood.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.789
I had a bad childhood
and I don't do porn.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.025
Yes, but you're dead inside.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.797
I'd better take that back.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.126
What, why? Why?

12:16.635 --> 12:18.432
We can't watch it.
It's Phoebe.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.038
We shouldn't watch this.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.605
Absolutely not. That goes back.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.342
-Maybe a bit.
-The first half?

12:27.980 --> 12:30.710
This is wrong, you guys!
Phoebe's our friend!

12:30.983 --> 12:33.213
-I'm not gonna watch it.
-Yeah!

12:33.619 --> 12:35.109
Good for you, Joe.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.327
I thought I'd find you here,
Nosferatool.

12:54.006 --> 12:57.806
Are you going to plunge
your stake into my dark places?

12:58.010 --> 13:02.811
Actually, I was kind of hoping it
would be the other way around.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.008
What's that on her ankle?

13:07.253 --> 13:09.483
Her ankle is what you're watching?

13:10.523 --> 13:13.014
Well, it's hard to tell.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.256
God, if she would just stop moving.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.924
She's just doing her job.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.389
You sick bastards!

13:22.701 --> 13:24.191
It's a tattoo.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.597
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't..

13:27.506 --> 13:30.907
Wait, that's Ursula!
That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!

13:31.577 --> 13:34.774
Wait, wait! I can watch that!
Rewind it! Rewind it!

13:36.549 --> 13:37.846
Hey.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.745
What's up? Oh, my God!
What am I doing?!

13:53.566 --> 13:54.590
Hey, sweetie.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.234
"Chicken Soup for the Soul"?

14:03.375 --> 14:05.502
There's no back to this couch.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.378
You hate this kind of stuff.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.515
I figured I'd give it a shot.

14:11.750 --> 14:16.346
One of the stories may make me cry,
then you won't think I'm dead inside.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.217
Oh, that's so sweet.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.722
I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.

14:22.027 --> 14:26.020
Oh, that makes me feel so warm
in my hollow tin chest.

14:26.765 --> 14:28.460
Stop it.

14:28.734 --> 14:33.068
Seriously. We get married, I'm up
at the altar and I'm like this:

14:35.207 --> 14:36.401
I won't care.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.735
I know that you'll be feeling it
all in here.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.877
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.139
And if we have a baby one day...

14:44.416 --> 14:47.385
and the doctor hands it to you
in the delivery room...

14:47.620 --> 14:50.111
and you don't cry, so what?

14:51.290 --> 14:53.952
If we take him to college
and come home...

14:54.226 --> 14:57.491
and we see his empty room
for the first time...

14:57.763 --> 14:59.754
and you got nothing?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.897
It won't matter to me.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.437
Okay.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.668
I won't worry
about this anymore then.

15:09.975 --> 15:12.102
And then, you know, if I die...

15:13.913 --> 15:16.347
from a long illness...

15:16.582 --> 15:18.516
and you're writing my eulogy...

15:18.751 --> 15:22.278
and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:

15:22.488 --> 15:25.457
"I will always be with you"...

15:25.858 --> 15:30.192
and you still can't shed
one tiny tear?

15:31.263 --> 15:33.424
I know you'll be
crying a river inside.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.129
-I love you.
-What is wrong with you?!

15:39.271 --> 15:40.260
-What?
-What?

15:40.706 --> 15:43.539
You can't shed a tear
for your dead wife?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.607
I left you a note from the beyond!

15:45.844 --> 15:48.813
-So you didn't mean any of that?
-No, you robot!

15:54.687 --> 15:59.147
You damn kids! You ring my bell
one more time and I swear..

15:59.391 --> 16:01.484
Oh, Jill!

16:02.695 --> 16:05.493
That's a game I play
with the kids down the hall.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.464
They've really taken a liking to me.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.831
What's the matter?

16:13.238 --> 16:16.230
Rachel and I had a big fight.
Can I come in?

16:16.508 --> 16:19.705
I know we're not supposed
to see each other anymore.

16:19.912 --> 16:23.507
I don't know anybody in this city
and I need somebody to talk to.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.182
Sure. What happened?

16:25.384 --> 16:27.318
I don't want to talk about it.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.913
Okay.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.353
-You know what might cheer me up?
-What?

16:36.595 --> 16:39.496
Seeing some more of your
super cool slides.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.224
-Wow, really?
-Totally. I loved them.

16:43.502 --> 16:47.097
You could finish telling me about
the different kinds of sand.

16:49.608 --> 16:53.772
I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go
get the projector and my notes.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.377
Thanks. You're such a good friend.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.618
Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.222
-No.
-Is Ross home?

17:07.459 --> 17:10.394
Maybe I'll call him and see
if he's seen her..

17:19.371 --> 17:20.395
Who is it?

17:20.606 --> 17:22.369
It's Phoebe...

17:22.775 --> 17:24.834
"Phoebe"!

17:25.644 --> 17:28.078
-Hey!
-Oh, God!

17:30.616 --> 17:32.413
So you're making porn movies.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.284
No, I'm not.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.545
We're still rolling!

17:36.822 --> 17:38.551
You're making one right now!

17:39.458 --> 17:40.618
Let's go, Phoebe.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.622
And you're using my name.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.756
Can I help you with something?

17:46.265 --> 17:47.357
Phoebe, come on!

17:47.533 --> 17:51.401
Look, I'm talking right now.
You mean her. Oh.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.931
You know, twin stuff is always
a real big seller.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.402
What?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.975
I could talk them into giving you...

18:00.245 --> 18:01.439
thirty dollars.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.775
No! No way! No!

18:06.018 --> 18:09.078
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!

18:09.321 --> 18:12.085
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!

18:12.357 --> 18:14.291
Especially you, with that!

18:17.596 --> 18:20.360
The slides are almost ready.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.089
Yeah.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.529
I know what this is missing:

18:24.837 --> 18:26.327
Alcohol.

18:28.006 --> 18:29.769
There's wine in the kitchen.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.202
Oh, great.

18:36.548 --> 18:40.780
What is my sister doing there,
and why are the drapes shut?

18:43.322 --> 18:45.187
Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?

18:45.457 --> 18:48.221
She's really upset.
We're just talking.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.861
She's making something happen
with you to get back at me.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.032
That's the only reason
she could be here, huh?

18:55.300 --> 18:58.497
It couldn't be that maybe
I'm a good listener...

18:58.704 --> 19:01.969
and I put on a great slide show?

19:04.476 --> 19:09.641
Ross, I am telling you,
she is using you to get back at me.

19:09.882 --> 19:14.581
I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.486
That was your sister, actually.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.889
She thinks you're just using me.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.461
So?

19:32.871 --> 19:34.930
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:35.140 --> 19:38.041
I just came from the company
Ursula works for.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.039
Oh, no, not you too?

19:41.713 --> 19:45.342
I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.
There were a lot of them.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.182
Nice!

19:48.453 --> 19:50.853
And I won't have to
go back there anymore...

19:51.123 --> 19:54.286
because I gave them
my "correct address."

19:56.028 --> 19:59.896
Isn't it gonna bother you
that people think you're a porn star?

20:00.132 --> 20:02.498
Oh, no, I know how to handle it.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.133
-Good.
-Yeah.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.299
Trying to figure out how you know me?

20:08.507 --> 20:11.237
I'll give you a hint. From porn!

20:12.077 --> 20:16.309
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!

20:20.319 --> 20:21.718
-See?
-Yeah.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.684
Hey.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.353
You may have been right about Jill.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.495
I knew it! What happened?

20:32.531 --> 20:33.657
She kissed me.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.924
What? You kissed?

20:36.268 --> 20:38.566
Maybe we should
give them some privacy...

20:41.440 --> 20:43.840
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

20:44.076 --> 20:47.341
Doesn't sound like it.
It's easy not to kiss someone.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.844
You just don't. Look at us
right now, not kissing!

20:52.117 --> 20:55.450
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me...

20:55.687 --> 20:57.587
and I didn't stop it.

20:57.856 --> 20:59.551
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

20:59.791 --> 21:02.783
Yeah. Let me give you
something to think about.

21:03.061 --> 21:08.192
Hold on! But then I started
thinking and I stopped the kissing.

21:08.567 --> 21:13.470
Thank you for taking your tongue out
of my sister's mouth to tell me that.

21:16.742 --> 21:19.711
I realized if anything happened
with me and Jill...

21:19.945 --> 21:23.244
then nothing could ever
happen with us.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.383
-What?
-No, I mean...

21:26.585 --> 21:30.214
I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us...

21:30.489 --> 21:32.616
again, ever.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.887
But I don't want to know
that it never could.

21:37.262 --> 21:38.991
So I stopped it...

21:40.399 --> 21:43.232
and she got mad
and broke my projector.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.503
Wow.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.072
I don't even know what to say.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.413
Thank you.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.984
You're welcome.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.462
My God, are you crying?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.136
I just don't see why those two
can't work things out!

22:23.408 --> 22:24.875
All right, I'm leaving.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.704
I'm not spending one more day with
someone who's out to sabotage me.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.106
That's you, Rachel.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.307
Yeah, I got that.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.245
And you! I throw myself at you...

22:35.454 --> 22:38.116
and you say no? How gay are you?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.996
You take care, Jill.

22:46.164 --> 22:49.793
Okay, I'm leaving. Don't worry
about me, I'll make it on my own.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.630
Who knows how I'll get by,
or even if I'll survive.

22:52.804 --> 22:56.035
You can stop that now,
I know you made up with Daddy.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.507
-You do? How?
-Oh, just a wild guess...

22:59.678 --> 23:02.238
and your limo just pulled up.

23:02.414 --> 23:06.214
-Sorry I didn't get to know you guys better.
-Absolute shame.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.853
-Okay, see you.
-Bye-bye.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.650
I can't believe Jill's gone.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.985
I can't help it, I opened a gate!
