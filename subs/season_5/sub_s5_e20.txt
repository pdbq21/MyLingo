WEBVTT

00:02.769 --> 00:04.566
Okay, guys, listen.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.363
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

00:07.607 --> 00:10.405
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

00:10.577 --> 00:11.942
Good idea.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.739
Hey, man. What's up?

00:15.048 --> 00:17.744
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.244
Oh, Ross! Look, look!

00:24.224 --> 00:25.248
What? Where?

00:25.458 --> 00:28.120
Right over there! There!
Look, look, look!

00:29.529 --> 00:32.464
-What am I looking at?
-Somebody help me out here.

00:33.466 --> 00:34.455
Hey!

00:36.136 --> 00:39.105
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.

00:39.372 --> 00:43.775
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.102
You got to go on a ride-along?

00:46.312 --> 00:48.780
-I want to go on a ride-along!
-Me too!

00:48.982 --> 00:50.643
-Okay.
-Yeah! Me too!

00:50.950 --> 00:52.440
Really? You?

00:54.888 --> 00:55.877
Yeah.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.448
-Well, it's kind of dangerous.
-Well, I like danger.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.159
-Okay, you guys free tonight?
-Yeah!

01:04.731 --> 01:07.564
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

01:11.604 --> 01:14.038
The One With the Ride-Along

01:59.452 --> 02:02.250
I'm so glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.490
Oh, thank God!

02:04.691 --> 02:05.919
Finally!

02:07.293 --> 02:09.761
I've broken them down
into categories.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.864
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids....

02:13.066 --> 02:15.398
And I've cross-referenced
them by subject.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.627
So if you're looking up, say...

02:17.937 --> 02:20.770
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.963
See?

02:23.743 --> 02:25.870
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.379
Wow, I miss that dog.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.550
You can also find him
under "dog" and "dead."

02:33.820 --> 02:34.809
Great. Thanks.

02:35.555 --> 02:38.888
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

02:44.797 --> 02:45.957
Oops.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.792
Sorry.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.832
Good thing you numbered them.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.025
I hadn't.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.068
Photo 152 was a prototype.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.667
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

02:57.944 --> 03:01.107
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

03:01.614 --> 03:03.138
Ross has the blender.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.746
Everything's just falling apart.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.588
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.248
-You get the margarita stuff ready.
-All right.

03:13.459 --> 03:16.292
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.860
Want me to stop at the ATM?

03:18.131 --> 03:21.430
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.300
-What?
-What?

03:25.471 --> 03:27.462
I don't do that.

03:37.383 --> 03:41.217
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.945
It is starting to get dark out there.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.285
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.826
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

03:51.497 --> 03:54.557
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.161
-Want me to grab the berry for you?
-It's called a cherry.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.203
It's called
Chandler!

04:06.746 --> 04:08.907
Okay, I got it.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.409
This place makes the
best sandwich in the world.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.380
Does it have meatballs?

04:14.587 --> 04:15.576
Oh, yeah.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.416
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

04:17.724 --> 04:18.713
Yep.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.889
You can't eat that in my car.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.321
Yeah, okay.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.158
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.260
Your tax dollars?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.039
Yeah, okay.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.106
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.215
Did I say you could smell it?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.549
I can't smell it?

04:48.955 --> 04:53.392
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.088
Okay, I'll give them back.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.892
What is so great about that sandwich?

05:02.802 --> 05:06.135
Imagine the best sex you ever had.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.601
-Are you thinking about Monica?
-Yeah.

05:08.941 --> 05:09.930
What's that like?

05:23.323 --> 05:26.451
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

05:26.759 --> 05:28.420
Please, please.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.829
"Made in Mexico."
Yes!

05:34.934 --> 05:37.061
Who would buy this?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.171
Rach, it's me. Pick up!

05:48.848 --> 05:49.837
What's up?

05:50.116 --> 05:52.084
I need a few more things
for the margaritas.

05:52.318 --> 05:56.812
I need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.425
So all we had was ice?

06:00.793 --> 06:02.192
See if he has ice.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.299
Hello, Ross?

06:17.510 --> 06:18.977
It's Emily here.

06:19.178 --> 06:23.274
I know this is out of the blue,
but I'm getting married tomorrow.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.383
Well, maybe I am....

06:25.651 --> 06:27.619
I keep thinking about you.

06:28.354 --> 06:32.017
And I'm wondering if we made
a mistake giving up so fast.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.886
Are you thinking about me?

06:34.360 --> 06:37.852
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.793
Okay, bye.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.030
Where we going?

06:50.209 --> 06:53.542
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

06:53.746 --> 06:57.409
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.511
Come on, man.

06:59.719 --> 07:03.985
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

07:04.223 --> 07:06.851
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.885
Yeah. No one talks like that.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.827
-Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
-I'm more cop than you two.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.694
How do you figure that?

07:16.903 --> 07:19.167
I'm in the front seat, okay?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.770
I'm Gary's partner.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.170
When you say "partner,"
it doesn't sound cop.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.072
It sounds gay.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.208
Jealous.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.216
-Hey, we're undercover here.
-Oh, yeah. No problem.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.287
-Ross!
-Sorry.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.585
There.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.526
Hey, Gary. Who am l?

07:45.731 --> 07:47.426
Phone home.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.898
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.742
What's up with that, Serpico?

07:58.611 --> 08:01.079
"What's up with that, Serpico?"

08:03.850 --> 08:07.081
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.344
But if you are, call me tonight.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.216
Okay, bye.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.358
No.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.459
I know!

08:18.931 --> 08:22.094
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.130
What? We can't do that.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.429
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

08:26.639 --> 08:28.800
...and calls her back and
they get back together?

08:29.041 --> 08:32.033
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

08:32.278 --> 08:35.714
...neurotic, crazy Emily?
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?

08:36.148 --> 08:37.979
No! Oh, no, no.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.811
God, no! He should not
get back with her.

08:41.087 --> 08:44.579
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.088
But we have no right
to erase his message.

08:47.326 --> 08:51.922
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.291
Doesn't that give me
the right to control him?

08:56.335 --> 08:57.927
Help him?

08:58.804 --> 09:01.136
He's not the one who needs help.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.937
She's obviously unstable.

09:05.177 --> 09:08.578
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.843
Okay, fine. But look at the
position she's putting him in.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.250
And what's he gonna do?

09:18.457 --> 09:21.517
Run over there on the wedding day
and break up the marriage?

09:21.794 --> 09:23.625
Who would do that?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.861
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.467
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

09:35.207 --> 09:38.176
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

09:38.377 --> 09:41.540
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.009
I mean, listen.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.546
Your messages have been erased.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.445
No!

09:49.422 --> 09:52.755
Well, that worked out well. Margarita?

09:58.130 --> 10:01.861
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.400
No. But that reminds me.
Sign this.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.728
What is it?

10:06.005 --> 10:08.667
It just says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

10:08.908 --> 10:10.535
...or get your head blown off.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.013
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.071
Here he comes.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.915
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

10:21.153 --> 10:22.142
What is it?

10:22.321 --> 10:23.811
-ls everything okay?
-What?

10:24.056 --> 10:27.389
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him!

10:42.675 --> 10:45.610
Hey, it's okay.
It was just a car backfire.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.442
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

10:50.716 --> 10:51.842
You see that?

10:52.118 --> 10:53.779
You see what he did?

10:54.453 --> 10:55.886
You okay, man?

10:59.759 --> 11:00.783
Thanks, Joey.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.624
Hello?

11:07.566 --> 11:08.897
Hi.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.499
You all right?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.668
We should go.

11:17.843 --> 11:18.832
No, wait.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.069
Oh, yeah. Right.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.777
No. Monica.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.880
Monica, we have to fix this.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.210
What can we do?
You erased the message.

11:27.687 --> 11:32.351
Yeah, but maybe I could call his machine
and re-create the message.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.992
All right, okay....

11:34.794 --> 11:37.285
Hello, Ross, this is Rachel Emily.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.799
God, what is it with those two names?

11:42.835 --> 11:47.966
I do so wanted to say
that I'm going to be getting married...

11:48.140 --> 11:51.371
...to another British person.

11:51.544 --> 11:57.608
And I'm having doubts and scones....

11:58.718 --> 12:02.745
-I can't remember what she said.
-Yeah, that's the problem with this plan.

12:03.122 --> 12:06.250
Rachel, come on. The message
is erased, there's nothing we can do.

12:06.425 --> 12:07.915
He's never gonna find out.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.584
I could tell him about it.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.562
If you want to be rational,
I can't argue with you.

12:13.866 --> 12:14.890
All right?

12:15.601 --> 12:18.934
Fine, tell him. I just don't
want to be a part of it.

12:20.706 --> 12:24.039
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

12:25.377 --> 12:29.780
Hey, Ross, it's you. I just
want you to remember this feeling.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.976
You are lucky to be alive.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.449
So live every day to the fullest.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.054
Love yourself, okay?

12:40.159 --> 12:42.150
And also get stamps. Bye.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.388
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

12:47.633 --> 12:48.725
Right?

12:50.302 --> 12:52.099
Anybody want to meet a hero?

12:52.338 --> 12:54.465
John Glenn is here?

12:55.174 --> 12:56.232
No. Joey.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.643
Joey's never been in outer space.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.376
We had the most incredible night.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.879
-We're in the car
-Wait. Hold on.

13:07.653 --> 13:08.642
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.683
Okay, go ahead.

13:11.524 --> 13:15.290
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.

13:15.728 --> 13:19.027
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

13:19.298 --> 13:21.323
...throws himself on me.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.625
My God!

13:22.902 --> 13:25.370
It was a car backfire.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.071
But he didn't know that.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, I didn't know that.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.911
It could just as easily
have been a bullet.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.172
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.475
Who jumps at loud noises.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.547
Wow. I could have died tonight.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.657
Yeah, if the car that backfired
had run over you!

13:48.894 --> 13:53.160
I'm gonna go home, before Ross starts
rambling about his newfound respect for life.

13:53.399 --> 13:57.096
I do have a newfound respect for life.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.771
Oh, my God!

14:02.608 --> 14:05.839
Ross, I could have told you
you weren't gonna die today.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.571
What? You know when I'm gonna die?

14:12.418 --> 14:15.216
-You want to get some dinner?
-Sure.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.589
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.454
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

14:23.729 --> 14:24.957
Okay.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.354
Bye.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.565
Cut it out.

14:34.773 --> 14:38.539
I'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.244
Why'd you take off?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.716
Just going for a walk.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.416
Around the living room, whatever.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.998
-ls something wrong?
-No. No, I'm just tired.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.496
You know, from the walk.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.097
You dove in front of Ross!

15:07.907 --> 15:08.896
Ross!

15:10.109 --> 15:12.077
That's what this is about.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.944
Oh, my God. You hate Ross!

15:18.150 --> 15:19.276
I don't hate Ross.

15:19.485 --> 15:23.285
Of course you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.082
You want Ross out of the picture.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.781
What picture?

15:27.993 --> 15:30.655
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.827
I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire.
But it could've been a bullet.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.295
And you didn't try to save me.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.536
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.973
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.

15:47.446 --> 15:51.382
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.

15:51.817 --> 15:55.218
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.115
That's the bottom line.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.048
No, not exactly.

16:00.659 --> 16:01.887
All right, look.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.128
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.020
Okay?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.962
My sandwich was next to Ross.

16:12.905 --> 16:13.894
All right?

16:15.674 --> 16:18.472
I was trying to save my sandwich.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.041
From a bullet?

16:23.082 --> 16:26.415
-I know it doesn't make much sense.
-"Much" sense?

16:27.219 --> 16:29.813
Look, it was instinct!
I just went for it.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.422
You risked your life for a sandwich?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.683
I know it sounds crazy...

16:34.994 --> 16:38.725
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world!

16:41.500 --> 16:44.333
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

16:44.570 --> 16:47.004
No. I would never do that.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.104
You're like my brother.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.068
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:52.378 --> 16:56.371
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me....

17:01.587 --> 17:03.020
Here.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.252
-Thanks.
-Easy, it's not a hot dog!

17:12.531 --> 17:14.192
How good is that?

17:16.969 --> 17:18.061
See?

17:18.437 --> 17:19.768
What are you doing?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.703
You're showing me how much
I mean to you.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.274
With a bite.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.542
Jeez!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.589
What are you doing here?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.789
Hey, you know what?

17:48.967 --> 17:51.663
You are in our apartment
all the time!

17:51.837 --> 17:54.397
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister!

17:56.241 --> 18:00.439
It doesn't matter. The important
thing is that you're here.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.648
You're my friend and you're here.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.254
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

18:12.491 --> 18:15.016
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.955
I thought my number was up.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.656
I had an actual near-death experience.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.127
What happened?

18:22.434 --> 18:26.803
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me!

18:30.209 --> 18:31.198
Really?

18:31.977 --> 18:33.535
No. A car backfired.

18:35.981 --> 18:39.712
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

18:40.185 --> 18:41.709
...I survived!

18:43.522 --> 18:47.549
And I was filled with
this great respect for life.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.056
I want to experience every moment.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.559
I want to seize every opportunity.

18:53.832 --> 18:57.461
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.863
Because a car backfired?

19:00.539 --> 19:02.530
Okay. Why are you here?

19:04.243 --> 19:08.475
I don't know how this fits
into your whole "seizing" thing...

19:08.680 --> 19:10.238
...but Emily called you today.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.813
-You talked to her?
-She left a message.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.919
But it kind of got erased.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.715
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.324
What did she say?

19:22.027 --> 19:25.929
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding...

19:26.165 --> 19:29.191
...and did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

19:29.735 --> 19:31.726
And she wants you to call her.

19:32.738 --> 19:33.727
Wow.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.107
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?

19:37.943 --> 19:39.774
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

19:40.045 --> 19:43.037
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Because

19:43.282 --> 19:45.750
I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.612
Because she didn't want

19:47.886 --> 19:52.186
Not important. Point is,
I was right. Your decision.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.446
Okay?

19:53.725 --> 19:55.022
I was right.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.023
Your decision.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.285
Right.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.195
I guess I should call Emily.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.697
No, that's not the right decision.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.403
That's not right.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.898
Ross, come on!

20:07.206 --> 20:08.298
I mean...

20:08.974 --> 20:10.965
...that woman made you miserable!

20:12.945 --> 20:15.470
Do you really want
to get back into that?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.911
Okay, look. Yesterday...

20:19.218 --> 20:22.278
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.988
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

20:25.224 --> 20:27.658
...I have a near-death experience?

20:27.926 --> 20:29.917
That's gotta mean something.

20:30.128 --> 20:34.724
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.163
You weren't there!

20:39.171 --> 20:42.937
Maybe this is something that
I'm supposed to seize, you know?

20:43.909 --> 20:45.467
Okay. You know what?

20:46.411 --> 20:50.177
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

20:50.482 --> 20:53.974
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.019
Okay? Look at today.

20:56.288 --> 20:57.846
I mean, you escaped...

20:58.490 --> 20:59.479
...death.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.958
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

21:05.264 --> 21:07.164
...getting back together with Emily.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.091
That does make sense.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.634
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...

21:15.874 --> 21:19.469
...but I really don't want
to see or talk to her.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.111
Well, there you go!

21:24.516 --> 21:26.279
Yeah, maybe today's just...

21:27.119 --> 21:29.280
..."close call" day.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.488
Hey, thanks, Rach.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.387
Oh, honey. No problem.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.055
Wait, wait.
The message is blinking.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.193
Maybe you didn't erase it.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.900
Hey, Ross, it's you

21:44.569 --> 21:48.528
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.174
-Hey, was Monica here?
-Yeah.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.646
I want my money back.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.149
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

22:07.559 --> 22:09.322
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

22:09.528 --> 22:10.654
Yes, once.

22:11.863 --> 22:12.887
A little.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.396
He kind of did it to himself.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.059
It's not really a good story.

22:18.904 --> 22:22.396
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

22:22.607 --> 22:24.165
...but heavy fire.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.400
Like, if I was in a war.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.545
Man, I would be great in a war!

22:28.847 --> 22:31.748
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.578
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.

22:36.121 --> 22:39.352
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

22:39.891 --> 22:43.691
I know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.625
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.128
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

22:52.604 --> 22:57.098
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm
not interested in war in any way.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.641
But when the revolution comes,
I'll have to destroy you all.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.006
Not you, Joey.
