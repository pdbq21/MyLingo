00:01.067 --> 00:02.466
Previously:

00:02.736 --> 00:06.331
There's this woman that I like a lot.

00:06.606 --> 00:08.767
But it's complicated.

00:08.942 --> 00:12.343
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.912
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

00:16.116 --> 00:20.280
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he a good guy?

00:21.921 --> 00:23.149
The best.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.916
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.

00:26.159 --> 00:29.458
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.323
I do, so much.

00:31.598 --> 00:34.328
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..

00:34.601 --> 00:38.002
You know what?
You have to go for it.

00:38.238 --> 00:43.039
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.177
It's Rachel.

00:55.622 --> 00:59.251
I'm sorry, did you just say
it's Rachel?

01:00.693 --> 01:02.354
Yes.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.198
You like Rachel?

01:09.002 --> 01:12.369
Yes. I like Rachel.

01:19.512 --> 01:21.070
Rachel?!

01:21.581 --> 01:24.641
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know..

01:24.884 --> 01:27.216
You know who else I like? You.

01:27.487 --> 01:31.218
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.926
-"Rachel" Rachel?
-It's not a big deal.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.588
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just..

01:40.900 --> 01:43.061
What about the stuff you said?

01:43.336 --> 01:48.000
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

01:48.208 --> 01:50.039
I'm an actor, you know?

01:50.310 --> 01:54.178
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

01:54.380 --> 01:57.611
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

01:57.851 --> 02:01.218
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

02:01.421 --> 02:04.549
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.759
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.529
You know, I gotta go.

02:10.763 --> 02:12.060
Hey, Ross..

02:12.265 --> 02:16.224
You know, I just have one--
Rachel?!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.542
Rachel?!

03:08.254 --> 03:11.052
Okay, she's kicking.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.483
She's growing inside you.

03:15.995 --> 03:20.523
-That was a big one.
-That's the youngest girl to reject me.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.957
-You guys!
-Hey there.

03:23.236 --> 03:26.467
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

03:26.739 --> 03:27.967
Oh, yes, I do.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.972
There's one person out there
for everyone.

03:31.244 --> 03:34.179
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

03:34.447 --> 03:37.439
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.481
He'll find me.

03:39.652 --> 03:40.880
And you?

03:41.120 --> 03:46.285
No. I believe that certain people
are more suited for each other, but..

03:46.492 --> 03:49.120
-Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
-Good.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.127
-Why?
-Well, last night, I met Monica's.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.198
What?

03:58.471 --> 04:02.339
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

04:02.542 --> 04:07.707
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

04:10.850 --> 04:12.875
Well, what's he like?

04:13.319 --> 04:16.516
-He's tall. He has brown hair.
-Of course.

04:16.723 --> 04:21.183
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

04:21.861 --> 04:24.421
-He works with food.
-Oh, sure. Older?

04:24.664 --> 04:28.191
-Obviously. And he's British.
-I was just gonna ask!

04:28.401 --> 04:32.861
And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.540
It's so sad they never met.

04:35.742 --> 04:40.304
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

04:40.747 --> 04:43.341
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.518
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

04:46.719 --> 04:49.688
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

04:49.889 --> 04:53.120
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.358
Rachel?!

05:05.805 --> 05:08.296
I didn't know Joey was on JAG.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.742
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.248
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

05:21.454 --> 05:25.550
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.886
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.955
I know you're hurting..

05:32.231 --> 05:34.199
but don't say that again.

05:35.868 --> 05:40.100
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.433
You don't need to worry.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.143
He'll never tell her how he feels.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.278
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

05:48.481 --> 05:52.474
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

05:53.453 --> 05:57.480
-He isn't thinking about going for her.
-He's not?

05:57.757 --> 06:01.420
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

06:01.661 --> 06:05.597
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

06:06.599 --> 06:10.126
-Why?
-He wants to leave the country.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.606
He thinks you hate him.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.368
Hate him?

06:20.813 --> 06:23.509
No, I don't hate him.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.953
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

06:29.188 --> 06:33.284
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you..

06:33.493 --> 06:37.486
but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

06:37.764 --> 06:42.133
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.438
Okay, I'll talk to him.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.333
I'd do it soon.

06:48.608 --> 06:53.477
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.843
-Hi!
-Hi.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.455
-Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
-Hello.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.650
Hello, nice to meet you.
How are you?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.454
Soul mate.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.990
-What are you guys doing?
-We had lunch at Adriatica.

07:16.235 --> 07:20.865
-What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
-I know! Is this 1985?

07:21.073 --> 07:24.770
-That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
-Not really.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.672
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

07:30.583 --> 07:33.381
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.052
No?

07:36.489 --> 07:40.084
-What restaurants do you like?
-Octavio. 27-and-7.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.627
-There's this place, Alessandro's.
-Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

07:44.864 --> 07:47.697
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

07:47.934 --> 07:52.030
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

07:52.238 --> 07:55.503
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.902
I'll have a mocha-ccino.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.180
What are you doing?

08:09.088 --> 08:12.455
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.126
You don't believe in soul mates, so..

08:15.328 --> 08:19.287
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.698
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.269
Phoebe? Good work.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.135
He's great. I love him.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.773
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

08:48.828 --> 08:52.628
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.130
No, I don't want to hit you.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.825
What, then? Kick me?

08:58.170 --> 08:59.398
No.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.136
Bite me?

09:02.842 --> 09:05.367
I don't want to do anything to you.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.842
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you..

09:10.316 --> 09:13.615
and that I certainly
do not hate you.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.414
I just came here to say that.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.989
Hey, wait, Ross?

09:21.260 --> 09:25.128
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.334
Yeah, sure.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.733
You got any beer?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.843
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.647
Okay.

09:51.290 --> 09:54.418
You need to understand something.

09:58.364 --> 10:02.698
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

10:02.935 --> 10:07.736
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.567
Thank you.

10:27.093 --> 10:31.427
Anyway, it'll just..

10:31.597 --> 10:34.998
It'll take me a while to get over her.

10:35.267 --> 10:39.397
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so..

10:39.639 --> 10:41.129
What?

10:43.743 --> 10:46.268
You're in love with her?

10:46.512 --> 10:51.211
-Yeah. I thought you knew that.
-No.

10:53.085 --> 10:57.522
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

10:57.757 --> 11:02.126
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

11:02.361 --> 11:06.297
But it just keeps getting harder.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.957
I don't know what to do, you know?

11:11.470 --> 11:13.597
What do I do?

11:19.445 --> 11:25.611
-You need to tell her how you feel.
-That's the green stuff talking.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.112
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

11:31.357 --> 11:35.259
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.656
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be..

11:38.864 --> 11:42.197
If she is where you are..

11:44.704 --> 11:48.970
then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.035
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.174
If she ends up with somebody else..

11:56.415 --> 12:00.283
the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.850
Hey, thanks.

12:04.156 --> 12:09.423
-So when are you gonna talk to her?
-Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.021
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

12:14.233 --> 12:18.067
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.605
What am I gonna say?

12:26.512 --> 12:29.003
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:43.129 --> 12:48.294
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the cheese.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.434
Cheese, you say?

12:50.703 --> 12:54.002
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

12:54.607 --> 12:58.236
-Excuse me?
-Cheese. It's smelly.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.603
You must smell a lot of the time too.

13:04.416 --> 13:09.046
Not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

13:09.255 --> 13:13.954
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.254
And you're still married to him?

13:21.400 --> 13:27.134
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.636
Not even bread. Just cheese.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.776
No, I want the bread.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.402
And pastries.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.739
And pate.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.779
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

13:41.554 --> 13:45.115
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.451
Is it made of cheese?

13:50.429 --> 13:53.990
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be incredible?

13:54.200 --> 13:57.067
-I'd move in tomorrow!
-Oh, come on!

13:58.804 --> 14:01.068
-Listen to this!
-I'm so sorry.

14:01.273 --> 14:05.607
-What do we do?
-They both want a house of cheese.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.179
I don't know how you fight that.

14:15.487 --> 14:19.947
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.524
Okay, stand up straight.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.662
Take a couple deep breaths.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.164
Look confident.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.006
Joey? What's up?

14:35.241 --> 14:39.644
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.142
What's up?

14:41.313 --> 14:44.305
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

14:44.516 --> 14:47.974
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

14:48.687 --> 14:51.815
I just came by to tell you that..

14:52.191 --> 14:56.059
I want to have dinner with you.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.026
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.359
Okay. That's good.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.902
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

15:08.874 --> 15:11.434
Don't you people ever knock?

15:12.978 --> 15:15.776
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
Wouldn't that be nice?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.448
Sure. Set it up.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.914
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.421
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.251
Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.393
But good enough.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.456
Jeez, what's with you?

15:31.697 --> 15:34.723
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

15:36.168 --> 15:40.400
-What's going on?
-Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.871
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

15:44.109 --> 15:49.376
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

15:49.615 --> 15:54.712
-You don't believe in soul mates?
-No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.113
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.622
-You don't?
-Nope.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.454
We weren't destined
to end up together.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.290
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

16:07.566 --> 16:10.228
Some days we work really hard.

16:10.836 --> 16:15.068
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

16:15.274 --> 16:21.270
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

16:21.513 --> 16:23.981
-I love you.
-I know.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.707
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

16:26.919 --> 16:31.356
I found this place that makes
the greatest jalapeno poppers.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.116
No? They taste so good.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.928
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

16:45.137 --> 16:48.004
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.309
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, sure.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.814
Look, the reason..

17:01.954 --> 17:03.888
Is it hot in here?

17:04.123 --> 17:07.354
Why don't you take off your sweater?

17:08.260 --> 17:10.319
This is a nice place..

17:10.562 --> 17:15.363
and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

17:15.567 --> 17:19.367
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

17:19.571 --> 17:20.833
Yeah, sure.

17:23.675 --> 17:27.338
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.212
How long have we known each other?

17:36.422 --> 17:38.322
Seven, eight..

17:38.557 --> 17:41.151
Eight years. Wow.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.890
A long time.

17:44.296 --> 17:47.231
But over the past few weeks, I..

17:47.499 --> 17:51.993
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.933
Our specials tonight..

17:54.173 --> 17:56.801
-Could you give us a second?
-Sure.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.340
Second's up!

18:01.747 --> 18:05.183
Not that kind of table.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.010
So you were saying?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.255
I'm not sure.

18:13.425 --> 18:18.055
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

18:18.330 --> 18:22.733
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half..

18:24.536 --> 18:26.470
and now here we are.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.898
Yeah. Here we are.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.520
I think I'm falling in love with you.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.247
What?

18:48.393 --> 18:51.260
I'm falling in love with you.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.597
Who are you talking to?

19:03.208 --> 19:05.972
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.944
Funny. It's funny!

19:09.214 --> 19:11.273
I don't get it.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.218
Okay.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.559
Wow.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.297
Okay, so the specials are..

19:40.712 --> 19:42.441
Are you..?

19:45.717 --> 19:48.083
How did..?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.416
When?

19:52.791 --> 19:55.259
Does it really matter?

19:57.963 --> 19:59.760
Wow. Wow.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.193
It is hot in here.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.130
I know this is a lot.

20:04.403 --> 20:07.634
You don't have to say anything.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.107
You take as much time as you need.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.416
Okay, you gotta say something.

20:22.287 --> 20:26.849
Joey, I love you so much.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.151
-But..
-But.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.455
Joey?

20:31.730 --> 20:34.324
Right. Hey, that's..

20:34.633 --> 20:36.863
That's okay. That's fine.

20:37.102 --> 20:42.005
It's pretty much what I was expecting.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.967
It's no big deal, all right?

20:49.147 --> 20:52.947
-I think I'm gonna go.
-Please don't leave like this.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.916
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

20:57.789 --> 20:59.416
Don't start doing that.

20:59.691 --> 21:03.218
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me..

21:03.428 --> 21:05.419
Oh, there we go!

21:07.933 --> 21:11.027
-Can I?
-Sure.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.498
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose..

21:15.707 --> 21:17.834
Hey, hey.

21:19.711 --> 21:23.374
You can't, okay? Ever.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.077
I'm so sorry.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.379
Please don't be sorry.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.852
Okay? Don't be sorry.

21:41.433 --> 21:44.061
You know, I was only kidding.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.635
Yeah, that was a real good one.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.318
-Is this your table?
-Yeah.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.011
-You'll be here all night.
-I know.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.850
I haven't even read the specials.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.826
What's the matter?

22:09.027 --> 22:13.828
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.168
I kind of hope it's the girl.

22:20.105 --> 22:23.233
The guy is really cute!
