WEBVTT

00:04.704 --> 00:08.162
Hey, I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. Do you wanna come?

00:08.541 --> 00:11.237
Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.

00:11.811 --> 00:13.472
Oh, no, I'll be there too.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.879
So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.250
No, I just need you there for support.
I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.718
Oh. Why not?

00:24.924 --> 00:28.121
Because I know he's gonna flip out,
and I hate it when he's angry.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.058
Rachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

00:31.264 --> 00:34.756
No, Phoeb, wait. He's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.

00:35.001 --> 00:38.630
He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
he'd make me eat the entire pack.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.340
Wow. Well, I will be there.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.705
Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man
make you eat your baby!

00:47.213 --> 00:50.705
Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.779
No, you don't.

00:53.019 --> 00:58.082
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party!

01:00.760 --> 01:02.591
Her what?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.960
Your secret bachelorette party.

01:07.467 --> 01:12.029
-You had a bachelorette party?
-She untied his G-string with her teeth.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.269
Somebody stop me!

01:15.809 --> 01:21.111
We weren't having bachelor, bachelorette
parties. We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

01:21.314 --> 01:24.078
It's a grand tradition!

01:24.451 --> 01:27.818
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.

01:28.054 --> 01:30.989
Well, you could've untied it
with your hands.

01:31.257 --> 01:35.751
This is so unfair. The one thing I wanted was
to throw my best friend a bachelor party..

01:35.929 --> 01:39.057
but I wasn't allowed.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

01:39.265 --> 01:42.325
You went home with the waitress.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.769
Yeah, that was a pretty good night.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.065
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

01:48.274 --> 01:52.404
You know that the two pillars of marriage
are openness and honesty.

01:52.645 --> 01:57.605
I knew giving you that book was gonna
come back and bite me in the ass.

02:37.290 --> 02:41.750
-I'll order everyone the Moroccan chicken.
-Oh, I don't eat meat.

02:42.428 --> 02:43.520
It's chicken!

02:44.797 --> 02:48.790
-I don't eat that either.
-I never understand you lesbians.

02:50.703 --> 02:55.834
-So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
-Well, actually..

02:56.109 --> 02:58.043
Your '74 Lafite, sir.

02:58.311 --> 03:02.680
I ordered the '75. That's a
magnificent wine. The '74 is sewage!

03:02.882 --> 03:05.976
Why would you bring me sewage?

03:06.252 --> 03:10.188
Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot?
Is that why you're a waiter?

03:10.390 --> 03:13.018
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.194
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

03:18.364 --> 03:22.562
In case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

03:22.802 --> 03:26.397
He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.803
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.035
Rachel..

03:33.279 --> 03:38.808
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.

03:39.352 --> 03:44.380
-Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
-Hey, that is the baby's problem.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.388
-Everything okay with the waiter?
-I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.

03:54.601 --> 03:59.300
So, sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what is new with you.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.701
I got TiVo.

04:06.512 --> 04:10.608
-What's TiVo?
-It's slang for "pregnant."

04:12.852 --> 04:15.821
Well, what were you thinking
asking me to come?

04:20.026 --> 04:21.550
Are you really pregnant?

04:21.961 --> 04:24.953
Well, yes and no.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.357
Except, not no.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.862
So to sum it up, yeah.

04:30.069 --> 04:34.267
Who is the father?
Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.303
No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.208
Daddy, I hope you're okay
with all of this.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.942
Think about it. This is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild!

04:48.187 --> 04:50.553
You're gonna be a poppy!

04:50.757 --> 04:53.954
That's true. I'm a poppy!

04:54.627 --> 04:57.755
I'm gonna be a poppy!

05:00.500 --> 05:03.401
-So when is the wedding?
-The who?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.936
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.

05:08.141 --> 05:13.738
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!

05:14.013 --> 05:18.780
-Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!
-February 2nd!

05:24.724 --> 05:27.249
It was cool seeing you lecture today.

05:27.460 --> 05:32.090
Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like
you were falling asleep.

05:32.332 --> 05:37.770
No, I had my eyes closed so I could
concentrate and, you know, take it all in.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.133
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.

05:41.641 --> 05:45.236
-I've got to get going.
-Okay, I'll see you tonight?

05:47.447 --> 05:52.851
Thanks for showing me your
semiprecious-stone collection. It's amazing.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.614
My God, you must be good in bed.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.151
So you and Mona, it's been a while now.
How's it going?

06:02.795 --> 06:04.456
It's good. It's going good.

06:04.664 --> 06:08.065
I mean, we get along great.
She's so..

06:08.334 --> 06:11.531
-Hot?
-I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!

06:12.538 --> 06:14.563
She's okay with the baby?

06:14.807 --> 06:19.005
I haven't actually told her yet.
I don't wanna scare her off.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.546
You have to be honest. Otherwise, you may
think you're going down the same path..

06:23.716 --> 06:25.911
but you're really going
down different ones.

06:26.152 --> 06:30.521
I'm gonna take that book
and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.293
Oh, my God, you are gonna
love me so much.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.360
Oh, good. Because so far in this marriage,
I just like you a lot.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.432
All right. I felt bad about
the bachelorette party thing..

06:41.601 --> 06:44.536
so tonight you're gonna have
a bachelor party.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.664
I got this number from this guy at work and
I hired a stripper to come dance for you.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.671
Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?

06:54.881 --> 06:59.341
-Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.
-Will you let the lady talk?

07:00.219 --> 07:03.746
Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel so much better.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.423
I got you party hats and porn.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.925
Throw in my father making out
with the magician..

07:11.097 --> 07:14.430
and it's just like my 14th birthday
all over again.

07:15.435 --> 07:20.964
Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.
I'm not a bachelor anymore.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.736
Don't think of it as a bachelor party. Think
of it as a two-month anniversary present.

07:25.978 --> 07:30.142
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.

07:31.484 --> 07:35.580
Please, I feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked!

07:36.289 --> 07:39.725
-Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.
-Yeah!

07:40.993 --> 07:42.984
And Joey.

07:43.262 --> 07:48.666
-Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
-Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

07:48.901 --> 07:52.302
Actually, sorry, I can't even make it.
I'm seeing Mona tonight.

07:52.572 --> 07:56.235
Who would cancel an actual date
just to go to a fake bachelor party?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.809
I'm sorry.
I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

08:04.383 --> 08:09.514
I'm sorry I won't make it to your
imaginary wedding, but I'm busy that day.

08:10.423 --> 08:15.292
I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.759
I know, I know. I panicked.

08:19.966 --> 08:24.835
I didn't want him to start yelling at me
like I was some '74 Latour.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.833
It's Lafite.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.698
The '74 Latour is actually
drinking quite nicely.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.978
All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna be strong.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.412
I just called a friend of mine.

08:39.118 --> 08:43.316
I think I may be able
to book The Plaza on short notice.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.018
Really?

08:46.459 --> 08:47.926
The Plaza?

08:48.127 --> 08:50.357
Oh, Daddy!

08:51.564 --> 08:55.466
-Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you.
-What is it, sweetie?

08:57.169 --> 09:00.036
There's not gonna be a wedding.
Ross and I aren't getting married.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.673
-I'm sorry, Daddy.
-I don't believe this!

09:02.875 --> 09:06.675
-Daddy, stay calm, please.
-How do you expect me to stay calm?

09:06.879 --> 09:10.576
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
And I wanna know why!

09:10.816 --> 09:13.751
Is it because that punk
won't marry you?

09:14.020 --> 09:16.784
-Is that it?
-Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.157
You nervous about getting married?

09:31.837 --> 09:33.566
What are you doing?

09:34.006 --> 09:38.340
Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party,
before your wedding. It'll be more fun.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.844
All right. I can't believe
tomorrow's the big day.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.781
How's it feel knowing you're never
gonna be with another woman?

09:47.954 --> 09:52.414
Knowing you're gonna have to wake up
to the same face every day..

09:52.592 --> 09:56.551
until you finally have
the sweet release of death.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.127
You're right. This is more fun.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.596
That's her! Okay, come on!

10:14.213 --> 10:16.306
Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?

10:16.549 --> 10:18.414
That's me!

10:19.785 --> 10:20.809
That's me.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.381
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.585
-Is that a bedroom?
-Yeah, right over there.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.763
All right. Whenever you're ready.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.466
That was weird.

10:36.235 --> 10:39.432
-Why would she go in the bedroom?
-I'm waiting.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.743
-So she's a..
-Yeah, that's one naked hooker.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.920
I love your place.
Where is this guy from?

10:59.158 --> 11:02.491
That's an 18th-century lndian artifact
from Calcutta.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.026
Oh. Wow.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.699
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.233
So much more.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.003
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

11:20.212 --> 11:22.442
Forget it. It's from Pier 1.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.285
Sorry.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.683
You think you can knock up my daughter
and then not marry her?

11:35.928 --> 11:38.362
I'm gonna kill you!

11:40.733 --> 11:44.396
You know, this is actually not
a great time for me.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.936
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.

11:51.143 --> 11:54.112
-First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
-You got Rachel pregnant?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.143
-Who did?
-You did!

11:57.550 --> 12:01.748
Yes, I did, but it was a one-night thing.
It meant nothing.

12:01.954 --> 12:05.720
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter
means to you, nothing?

12:05.891 --> 12:09.725
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
I care.. I love Rachel.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.523
-What?
-But not that way.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.724
I'm not in love with her.
I love her like a friend.

12:15.901 --> 12:19.428
That's how you treat a friend,
get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?

12:19.672 --> 12:24.041
Hey, I offered to marry her.
But I didn't want to.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.603
Well, why not? So you could
spend your time with this tramp?

12:28.781 --> 12:30.112
Tramp?

12:30.316 --> 12:33.877
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.

12:35.554 --> 12:39.183
I can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there!

12:39.391 --> 12:42.087
Maybe she's a hooker
and a stripper..

12:42.261 --> 12:45.253
but she got confused
about what to do.

12:45.898 --> 12:49.459
Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
We just missed it.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.931
Ma'am?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.269
Are you also a stripper?

12:58.511 --> 13:01.639
No, but I can pretend to strip.
But that's gonna cost extra.

13:01.847 --> 13:04.907
Okay, here's the extras:
handcuffs, spanking..

13:07.520 --> 13:10.216
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

13:10.422 --> 13:14.119
Getting her own husband a hooker.
That's pretty funny.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.958
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

13:19.331 --> 13:24.030
I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.

13:24.503 --> 13:28.269
-Do you mind if I smoke in here?
-Actually, I'd rather..

13:28.941 --> 13:32.638
Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to
burn that room down anyway.

13:34.513 --> 13:38.347
-How could you have kept all this from me?
-I was going to tell you, but..

13:38.551 --> 13:42.282
You figure you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.

13:42.521 --> 13:46.855
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.853
Can I..?

13:53.632 --> 13:56.260
Why don't we just let the machine get that.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.270
Hey, Ross, it's Joey.
There's a hooker over here..

14:00.472 --> 14:03.532
and we thought maybe you'd
know something about it.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.641
No! No! No!

14:05.878 --> 14:07.038
No!

14:07.279 --> 14:09.577
I need to lie down.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.687
Hey, guys, can I talk to you
for a minute?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.984
Listen, again, I want to urge you
to push the duck special..

14:20.159 --> 14:23.492
because if they don't eat the duck,
you're going to, and it's not very good.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.362
Tonight's the night
of the big bachelor party?

14:28.567 --> 14:32.401
-Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
-No problem. Say, who's the party for?

14:32.638 --> 14:36.005
-For my husband.
-You hired your husband a hooker?

14:36.508 --> 14:38.999
-She's a stripper.
-No, she's a hooker.

14:39.778 --> 14:43.441
-Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
-When they're hookers.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.850
Oh, my God.
Stu, I can't believe you did this.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.016
Now, you're sure she's a hooker?

14:49.288 --> 14:54.123
It's either that, or she's just the best,
most expensive date I ever had.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.563
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.631
Why would she do that?

15:02.801 --> 15:05.736
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.

15:07.773 --> 15:11.869
Is there anything you're really bad at,
you know, sexually?

15:12.811 --> 15:16.178
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.

15:16.649 --> 15:20.244
-What's taking you boys so long?
-In a minute!

15:20.519 --> 15:23.215
"In a minute"?
What's gonna happen in a minute?

15:23.656 --> 15:26.090
All right. Maybe you should ask her
to leave.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.349
-Why me?
-Hey, it's your bachelor party.

15:28.827 --> 15:33.321
-Which is why you should do it.
-I don't want to. You do it.

15:33.532 --> 15:37.696
All right. Rock, paper, scissors
for who has to tell the whore to leave.

15:40.973 --> 15:44.033
-What?
-I miss this.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.609
I don't think we've
actually done this before.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.347
No, I miss hanging out with you.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.710
-We still hang out.
-Not like we used to.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.988
Remember? You and me,
we used to be inseparable.

15:57.222 --> 16:01.921
You know, now it's like
things are different.

16:02.194 --> 16:06.358
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.863
And, hey, don't get me wrong,
I am so happy for you guys.

16:10.102 --> 16:15.267
I just miss hanging out.
Just us, you know?

16:16.408 --> 16:18.273
Yeah, I miss that too.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.775
I'll tell you what. From now on,
we'll make time to hang out.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.880
You got it. Come here.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.152
Oh, God.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.518
Listen, I am this close
to robbing you guys.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.250
She's a hooker! She's a hooker!
She's a..

16:38.530 --> 16:40.964
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.264
So your dad dropped by.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.905
He's a pleasant man.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.470
-Oh, no.
-I better go.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.482
Just over here.
I don't wanna miss the fight.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.020
Ross, I am so sorry.

17:07.292 --> 17:10.784
I promise, I will straighten this out
with him tomorrow, in person.

17:10.996 --> 17:12.623
Or via e-mail.

17:13.532 --> 17:18.492
I don't care about your dad. I care about
Mona. She was there and she's freaked out!

17:18.771 --> 17:22.207
Okay, I'll fix that too.
What's her e-mail address?

17:23.308 --> 17:26.300
All right, I promise, I'll fix this.
I swear. I'll talk to her.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.274
Okay. Thank you.

17:29.314 --> 17:32.681
That's it?
You call that a fight?

17:32.918 --> 17:37.719
"We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!"
What happened to you two?

17:43.629 --> 17:47.030
Thank you so much
for coming back over.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.001
Oh, good. You're here.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.864
And I was worried that
it was going to be uncomfortable.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.174
No, Mona, just hear me out.

17:56.442 --> 18:00.344
First of all, I am so sorry
about my father yelling at you.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.106
But I heard that you held your own.
You have to tell me how you did that.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.614
-Focus.
-Okay.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.981
Yes, Ross and I used to date.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.522
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

18:13.792 --> 18:17.728
But we are definitely not
getting back together.

18:17.896 --> 18:21.525
-How can I be sure of that?
-Because we drove each other crazy.

18:21.934 --> 18:27.770
He was possessive, he was jealous.
He could never just let the little things go.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.099
Trying to date this woman.

18:30.375 --> 18:34.869
None of that compared
to how kind and gentle..

18:35.080 --> 18:37.275
and thoughtful he is.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.450
You probably shouldn't touch me.

18:40.819 --> 18:44.448
I don't wanna get in the middle
of something so complicated.

18:44.656 --> 18:48.057
I get it, but, Mona, what relationship
is not complicated?

18:48.293 --> 18:51.126
We all have our baggage.
You must too.

18:51.396 --> 18:54.524
Why else would you still be single?

18:54.733 --> 18:57.224
I'm so gonna leave right now.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.364
Should I leave this open?

19:03.208 --> 19:06.974
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you
just tell me about all this?

19:07.179 --> 19:10.376
Because what's going on has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

19:10.649 --> 19:15.143
-You still should have told me.
-I know, and I was going to..

19:15.354 --> 19:19.347
but I thought it was better
that you heard it from Rachel's father.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.824
I made a mistake..

19:23.095 --> 19:27.589
but it's only because
I really, really like you. Really.

19:28.534 --> 19:33.301
Okay. I guess you can
close the door now.

19:44.650 --> 19:48.848
Forgot my purse.
Oh, you guys made up.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.685
He's a good kisser, isn't he?
I'm going!

19:59.665 --> 20:02.896
I swear I didn't know
she was a hooker.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.626
Did you let her smoke in here?

20:06.238 --> 20:11.835
Her ass-print is still on your grandmother's
quilt. Really want to talk about smoking?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.642
You know what,
I'm gonna make this up to you.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.542
I promised you a stripper..

20:19.451 --> 20:22.011
and you're gonna get a stripper.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.421
-Monica, wait.
-What?

20:27.292 --> 20:29.351
Carry on.

20:45.110 --> 20:49.137
These tennis shoes are so tight.

20:50.249 --> 20:54.208
-I think I'll take them off.
-Could you not narrate?

20:55.887 --> 20:57.946
Gotcha, sailor.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.932
Just because
you're not in love with the guy..

21:11.803 --> 21:15.170
-You told your dad the truth.
-About an hour ago.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.804
-Wanna go see a movie?
-Yes.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.444
Bye, Dad.

21:28.153 --> 21:31.782
It's unacceptable! What the hell does love
have to do with it?

21:32.024 --> 21:34.891
There are more important things
than love.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.129
You have to think about the baby.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.598
You have to think about
the consequences of your decisions!

21:45.671 --> 21:50.335
Hey, I do think about
the consequences of my decisions!

21:51.243 --> 21:53.711
Well, what gives you the right to..?

21:53.912 --> 21:56.210
Go to hell!

21:59.384 --> 22:02.376
Stupid guy on my phone.
