<i>Previously on Friends:</i>
- I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

00:05.964 --> 00:09.049
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

00:09.217 --> 00:11.176
- Is this about Mark?
- Oh, my God.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.679
- Okay, it's not.
- Oh, my God.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.056
I cannot keep having
this fight with you!

00:16.224 --> 00:18.517
Look, ugh,
maybe we should just take a break.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.853
Fine. You're right.
Let's, uh, take a break.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.939
- Let's get some frozen yogurt.
- No.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.900
A break from us.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.740
Then we had this big fight,
and I said I wanted to take a break.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.700
I don't want to take a break.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.035
This is crazy.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.911
Can't we work on this?

00:38.079 --> 00:39.163
What do you want to drink?

00:39.622 --> 00:41.165
Who's that?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.584
Nobody.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.295
- Is that Mark?
- Honey, look, he just...

00:46.463 --> 00:48.338
Yeah. Got it!

00:49.299 --> 00:51.216
Hey, come dance.
What are you, married?

00:51.384 --> 00:54.261
- Ha, ha.
- Because that's okay.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.402
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.821
How was the big anniversary dinner?

01:12.989 --> 01:16.033
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.951
Ha, ha, oh. Nice.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.830
We kind of broke up instead.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.665
What? Aah!

01:26.586 --> 01:28.670
My God! It's on the ceiling!

01:28.838 --> 01:29.922
That's okay.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.257
This is more important than fruit...

01:32.675 --> 01:34.009
...on my ceiling.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.845
You broke up?

01:37.013 --> 01:40.224
Yeah, but it's okay because
when Ross left, Mark came over.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.811
- Oh, no! You and Mark?
- No, it's okay. Calm down.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.437
Mark and I talked...

01:45.605 --> 01:49.858
...and I realized how much
I love your stupid brother.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.570
We got our problems,
but I really wanna make it work.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.047
Morning!

03:08.354 --> 03:10.022
Hi, it's me.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.608
I've been trying to reach you all night.
I feel awful.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.861
Please, Ross, you've got to know,
there's nothing between me and Mark.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.530
This whole breakup thing
is just stupid.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.869
Ugh, I'm sorry I put you through it.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.622
And I don't want to get
back together over a machine.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.956
Mm-mm.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.666
So I love you.

03:29.834 --> 03:30.876
I love you.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.296
And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now...

03:34.464 --> 03:39.343
...but on my way to work tomorrow,
I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.931
Chloe, how's it coming?

03:44.098 --> 03:46.558
What kind of puppy do you think
I should get?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.644
Um, oh, hey. I don't know.
How about a big one?

03:49.020 --> 03:51.521
- But my apartment's so...
- Then a small one.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.191
- We have to go.
- Wait! Where's my shoes?

03:54.359 --> 03:55.442
You need shoes?

03:58.905 --> 04:02.741
- Do I know why we're rushing?
- You know my girlfriend?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.994
It turns out that she, uh,
wants to get back together.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.204
I found it!

04:07.372 --> 04:09.456
That's so great for you guys!

04:09.624 --> 04:11.124
You must be so happy!

04:11.292 --> 04:14.253
Yes, I am.
One of the many things I'm feeling.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.967
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Oh, thank you. Ah, eh.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.347
Rachel!

04:28.476 --> 04:31.520
- You got my message?
- You are right on time!

04:31.688 --> 04:34.189
So can I be your girlfriend again?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.941
Yes, you can. Very much.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.360
Ah, ah.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.324
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:44.492 --> 04:48.036
- Why are you mopping your ceiling?
- Ugh, there's banana on it.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.666
I have the spirit of an
old Indian woman living in mine.

04:53.918 --> 04:54.960
So then you know.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.549
The mailman was here,
so I brought your mail.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.885
- Oh, good. Thanks.
- Now, what is Fabutech?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.180
Okay. Don't judge me too much, okay?

05:07.348 --> 05:10.809
I saw this infomercial,
and, um, I swear I have never...

05:10.977 --> 05:13.228
...bought anything on TV before.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.230
Except for this mop.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.358
But there was this stuff on leg-waxing,
it looked amazing.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.236
- Waxine!
- Yes! Have you seen it?

05:21.404 --> 05:24.031
It's incredible!
I want to be a Waxine Girl!

05:24.198 --> 05:25.449
I know!

05:26.826 --> 05:30.287
God! Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
How can they do that?

05:30.455 --> 05:33.874
Hello! Organic substances recently
discovered in the rain forest?

05:34.417 --> 05:36.793
They have the best stuff in there.

05:38.129 --> 05:42.299
Oh, my God!

05:43.217 --> 05:47.304
We figured when we couldn't find you,
you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.681
Which is probably what
you should have done, huh? Heh.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.768
You think?

05:53.770 --> 05:57.230
God, I'm in hell.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

05:57.398 --> 06:01.568
Rachel's all "I love you,"
and all I can think about...

06:01.736 --> 06:04.571
...is what is she gonna do
when I tell her what I did?

06:04.739 --> 06:08.575
First, we should address
the more important question...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.160
...how dumb are you?

06:12.330 --> 06:16.249
What? Look, we're trying to rebuild
a relationship here, right?

06:16.417 --> 06:19.044
How am I supposed to do that
without being honest?

06:19.212 --> 06:22.547
I'm on board about
the total-honesty thing. I am.

06:22.715 --> 06:26.301
Just not about stuff that's
gonna get you in trouble.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.930
He's right. Nobody benefits,
and you'll just hurt her.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.891
And there won't be a relationship
left to rebuild.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.101
Don't you think...?

06:34.268 --> 06:37.813
If you have to tell her,
at least wait till the timing's right.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.023
And that's what deathbeds are for.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.986
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

06:45.321 --> 06:50.325
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure
she doesn't find out some other way.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.829
Did you think about the trail?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.416
What trail?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.961
From the woman you did it with...

07:01.129 --> 07:04.423
...to the woman you hope
never finds out you did it!

07:05.133 --> 07:07.092
Always think about the trail!

07:08.886 --> 07:11.346
I don't think there's any trail.

07:11.889 --> 07:12.973
Okay, okay.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.475
Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.

07:15.643 --> 07:19.896
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works
at the massage place with Phoebe.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.066
Phoebe is Rachel's friend,
and that's the trail! I did it!

07:25.945 --> 07:28.905
"After applying the Waxine
and linen strips to leg... "

07:29.073 --> 07:30.532
- Did that!
- Okay.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.869
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab...

07:34.036 --> 07:35.412
...and pull it off in one quick...

07:35.580 --> 07:37.706
...pain-free motion. "
- Okay.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.374
Ow!

07:41.544 --> 07:43.044
Was it not "pain-free"?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.214
No, it was pain-ful!

07:46.382 --> 07:50.010
My God, they should call it
"Pain-zine, now with a little wax. "

07:51.637 --> 07:55.515
The girls on the commercial
don't seem to think it's that bad.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.852
Because their nerves are
deadened from being so stupid.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.858
But, you know, if you don't
believe me, please be my guest.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.987
Ow, ow, ow! Oh, my God!

08:09.572 --> 08:12.616
Now are you glad we didn't start
with the bikini strips?

08:18.414 --> 08:19.581
Chloe, hi.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.709
Is this about me taking your watch?

08:23.753 --> 08:26.880
- You took my watch?
- I'm sorry. I do that.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.259
You keep it. Listen,
did you tell anyone about us?

08:31.427 --> 08:34.596
Oh, no. I feel like it really
isn't anybody's business.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.974
Exactly. So you didn't
mention anything to Isaac?

08:38.142 --> 08:41.895
- Oh, I tell Isaac everything.
- You do? Of course you do.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.317
Hi, Isaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.110
You dog!

08:51.948 --> 08:56.409
Yes, I suppose I am a dog.
But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.828
Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.873
That's the one.
Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.834
Oh, hey, man, I know.
It doesn't matter how much we love them.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.546
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

09:09.465 --> 09:13.885
Yeah. Listen, can you keep
this information to yourself?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.638
Oh, no problem.
We gotta look out for each other.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.557
We're the same, you and me.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.271
Actually, no, we're not. Heh.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.855
Yeah, we are.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.233
No, we're not.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.734
Yeah, we are.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.112
No, we're not.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.781
- Okay, we're not.
- Right.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.324
But we are.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.080
Fine. I just need to know
that you're not gonna tell your sister.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.166
I can promise not to tell her again.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.422
- Jasmine?
- Uh-huh.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.425
We met at Phoebe's birthday party.
I'm Ross Geller.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.927
You did a bad thing!

09:57.346 --> 09:58.847
- Yes, I did.
- Very bad!

09:59.015 --> 10:00.890
- Very bad.
- Very, very bad!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.268
I'm agreeing with you.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.937
Listen, did you happen
to tell Phoebe yet?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.607
- No.
- Okay. Jasmine.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.276
Please. Please don't.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.864
I love my girlfriend very much
and I want to work it out with her.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.908
All right.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.202
Thank you. Thank you.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.290
But you should talk to my roommate.
I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.000
Who's your roommate?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.044
Gunther! Gunther!

10:30.087 --> 10:34.924
Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.885
I'm sorry.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.887
Was I not supposed to?

10:50.983 --> 10:54.069
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

10:55.446 --> 10:56.863
Ow, ow, ow!

10:58.991 --> 11:02.202
- We're all right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.373
- Ooh! We were just waxing our legs.
- Off?

11:07.708 --> 11:12.128
For your information, this is a pain
like no man will ever experience.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.090
You can't make that statement
unless you've been kicked in an area...

11:15.257 --> 11:18.009
...that God only meant
to be treated nicely.

11:18.928 --> 11:23.056
Women just have a lower threshold
for pain than men, that's all.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.850
I mean, come on,
it's just a little wax. Heh.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.727
Oh, yeah? Come here.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.272
Oh, that's mature.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.943
- So now I just pull it off?
- Uh-huh.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.194
That's right.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.787
Rachel, come on. Just talk to me. Please!

11:45.955 --> 11:48.415
- I can't look at you right now.
- What?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.167
Nothing. Nothing.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.879
- She said it was okay.
- What are they talking about?

11:56.507 --> 11:59.718
- Just get away from me!
- I made a mistake, okay?

11:59.885 --> 12:03.930
A mistake? What were you trying
to put it in? Her purse?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.435
Whe...? Where did he put it?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.815
You had sex with another woman!

12:14.400 --> 12:16.025
- Oh, my God!
- Oh...

12:16.193 --> 12:20.697
I knew something was wrong because
my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

12:22.199 --> 12:25.034
I guess they had a fight,
and he got drunk...

12:25.494 --> 12:28.121
You guys knew about this
and didn't tell us?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.790
He has sex,
and we get hit in our heads!

12:31.375 --> 12:33.877
- I want you to leave! Get out! Now!
- No! No!

12:34.044 --> 12:36.004
I want to stay and talk about this.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.132
Okay! All right. How was she?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.550
Uh-oh.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.264
- What?
- Was she good?

12:46.432 --> 12:47.515
Don't answer that.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.314
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk. How was she?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.192
- She was...
- Awful.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.487
- She was not good.
- Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.406
She... She was different.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.991
- Ooh.
- Uh-oh.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.119
Good different?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.456
Nobody likes change.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.126
- Just stop!
- What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

13:15.836 --> 13:17.212
Should we do something?

13:17.379 --> 13:19.547
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.595
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself...

13:25.763 --> 13:27.263
...and this morning I was upset...

13:27.598 --> 13:30.099
...and then I got your message,
and I was so happy.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.394
And all I wanted was to get her out
of my apartment...

13:33.562 --> 13:36.564
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.735
What time did your little friend leave?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.570
Uh...

13:44.657 --> 13:47.575
Oh, my God. She was there?
She was still there?

13:47.743 --> 13:50.870
She was in there when I was in there?

13:55.125 --> 13:58.545
Listen, the important thing is,
she meant nothing to me.

13:58.712 --> 14:02.340
And yet she was worth
jeopardizing our relationship!

14:04.009 --> 14:06.219
I didn't think there was
a relationship.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.805
- We'd broken up.
- We were on a break.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.559
That, for all I knew,
could last forever. That is a breakup.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.561
You're gonna get out of this
on a technicality?

14:14.728 --> 14:17.021
I'm not trying to "get out"
of anything.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.065
I thought our relationship was dead.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.194
Well, you sure had a hell of a time
at the wake.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.115
I don't think we should listen
to this anymore.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.325
What are you doing?
We can't go out.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.786
Why not? I'm hungry.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.290
Because they'll know
we've been listening.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.293
God! And to have to hear about it
from Gunther!

14:38.460 --> 14:43.131
Come on, I ran all over the place trying
to make sure that didn't happen!

14:45.259 --> 14:47.343
Oh, that is so sweet.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.848
I think I'm falling in love with you
all over again.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.645
We can go out.
They have other things to worry about.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.022
We'll be fine.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.692
Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.571
And then Chandler and Joey
convinced me not to!

15:10.200 --> 15:12.911
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.

15:14.455 --> 15:18.291
It's Phoebe. Someone has to take
my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...

15:18.459 --> 15:21.544
...because it's 9:15 now,
and I'm not there.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.883
None of this would've happened
if I didn't think...

15:27.051 --> 15:29.427
...you were having sex with Mark.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.720
All right.

15:31.472 --> 15:35.934
Let's say I had slept with Mark.
Would you have been able to forgive me?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.188
Yes, I would.

15:42.691 --> 15:47.070
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me
and been naked with me...

15:47.237 --> 15:48.696
...and made love to me?

15:50.115 --> 15:51.282
Yes.

15:52.493 --> 15:56.245
If you knew that our hot, sweaty,
writhing bodies were...

15:56.413 --> 15:58.623
La, la, la, la, la, la!

16:00.876 --> 16:04.587
Okay. Okay, yeah.
I would have been devastated...

16:05.130 --> 16:07.423
...but I would still want
to be with you.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.426
Because, I mean, it's you.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.470
Aw.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.270
What?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.816
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.320
I'm thinking...

16:32.074 --> 16:33.992
...I'm gonna order a pizza.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.913
Order a pizza, like...

16:39.957 --> 16:41.708
..."I forgive you"?

16:46.922 --> 16:48.423
Oh, man!

16:48.590 --> 16:50.216
Pizza?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.760
I like pizza.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.264
Put olives on the pizza.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.604
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

17:04.815 --> 17:07.025
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.653
No, not the used wax.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.156
Because that would be crazy?

17:16.118 --> 17:19.996
Could I get in on that?
Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.330
Fine.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.292
Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.670
- No anchovies.
- With, uh, extra anchovies.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.089
That's okay. I'll pick them off.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.634
And could you chop some up
and put it right in the sauce?

17:40.309 --> 17:42.477
You can have the last piece
if you want.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.480
Well, I should think so.
You slept with someone.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.703
They're gonna get through this,
aren't they?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.873
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.083
They've got to.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.419
What if they don't?

18:12.841 --> 18:15.134
You think I need a new walk?

18:18.347 --> 18:19.388
What?

18:19.556 --> 18:23.434
Well, I've been walking
the same way since high school.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.688
You know how some guys walk into
a room and everybody takes notice?

18:27.856 --> 18:29.899
I think I need a take-notice walk.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.944
Are you actually saying these words?

18:37.908 --> 18:40.368
What, now you're not even
talking to me?

18:43.247 --> 18:47.500
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.252
I thought I'd lost you.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.547
How insane must I have been
to do something like this?

18:52.714 --> 18:56.801
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me. I'm not Joey!

18:57.427 --> 18:59.011
Whoa!

19:01.098 --> 19:02.431
Yeah, okay.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.019
Hey.

19:07.187 --> 19:10.773
It's 3 a.m. They don't
know that I've come home yet.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.901
You notice how they aren't
wondering where I am?

19:14.736 --> 19:18.072
You know,
people can be so self-involved.

19:19.366 --> 19:23.494
You know what? I'm not the one
that wanted that break.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.289
You're the one that bailed.
You're the one...

19:26.456 --> 19:28.708
...that ran the moment things
got rough.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.084
- That's...
- That's what?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.920
- That is neither here nor there.
- Here we are...

19:33.088 --> 19:35.256
...in a spot again. What do you want?

19:35.424 --> 19:39.177
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?

19:42.472 --> 19:44.265
Look, I...

19:45.058 --> 19:49.145
I did a terrible, stupid,
stupid thing, okay?

19:49.605 --> 19:53.191
I'm sorry. I wish I could
take it back, but I can't.

19:53.609 --> 19:57.653
I just can't see us throwing away
something we know is so damn good.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.823
I love you so much.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.377
No, Ross! Don't!

20:13.545 --> 20:16.964
You can't just kiss me
and make it all go away.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.508
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.385
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.059
I think you should go.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.103
What?

20:31.271 --> 20:33.814
I really think you need to go now.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.526
Okay. Okay.

20:38.987 --> 20:42.323
This morning you said there was
nothing we couldn't work past it.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.200
What the hell did I know?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.411
There's got to be a way
we can work past this. Okay?

20:47.579 --> 20:50.581
I can't imagine my life without you.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.291
You know? Without...

20:54.795 --> 20:55.962
Without these arms...

20:57.089 --> 20:59.715
...and your face and heart...

20:59.883 --> 21:02.009
...your good heart, Rach, and...

21:06.515 --> 21:07.932
No.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.852
I can't. You're a totally
different person to me now.

21:12.521 --> 21:17.692
I used to think of you as somebody
that would never, ever hurt me.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.026
Ever.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.905
Now I can't stop picturing you with her.

21:23.073 --> 21:26.867
I can't. It doesn't matter what you
say or what you do.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.662
It's just changed everything.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.749
Forever.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.220
This can't be it.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.769
Then how come it is?

22:04.906 --> 22:07.074
They've been quiet for a long time.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.660
Maybe she killed him.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.207
Let's go.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.904
Is that your new walk?

22:49.409 --> 22:51.369
No. I really have to pee.

23:00.962 --> 23:02.963
