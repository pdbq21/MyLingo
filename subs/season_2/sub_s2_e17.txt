00:06.256 --> 00:07.723
So what do you think?

00:07.958 --> 00:10.153
Casa de Joey.

00:11.395 --> 00:13.454
-I decorated it myself.
-Get out!

00:15.265 --> 00:17.460
Wow, Joey, this is....

00:17.668 --> 00:20.330
-Art.
-Art it is.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.973
Check this out!
Is it a coffee table?

00:24.241 --> 00:27.438
Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

00:29.513 --> 00:31.447
Hey, nice pillow.

00:31.849 --> 00:34.511
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

00:35.586 --> 00:38.749
Hey, excellent water, table thing.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.254
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.517
It makes me want to pee.

00:44.361 --> 00:47.296
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.862
How come Chandler didn't come?

00:53.937 --> 00:56.030
It's because he had
a thing with the...

00:56.273 --> 00:57.297
...with the thing.

00:59.943 --> 01:01.433
Right. I got it.

01:03.013 --> 01:05.880
So why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.384
The best part! Come on.

01:18.028 --> 01:20.019
Nice toilet.

01:20.464 --> 01:21.954
No, no, no. Behind it.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.828
-You have a phone in here?
-That's right.

01:25.035 --> 01:26.297
I have a phone.

01:26.537 --> 01:27.868
In here.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.337
Joey, promise me something.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.806
Never call me from that phone.

01:34.878 --> 01:36.903
The One Where Eddie Moves ln

02:29.970 --> 02:31.494
Okay, here we go.

02:32.940 --> 02:37.434
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

02:38.779 --> 02:41.441
Oh, my God!
You won't believe this!

02:41.949 --> 02:44.440
I have just been discovered.

02:45.652 --> 02:49.588
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

02:53.327 --> 02:54.316
Anyway.

02:54.628 --> 02:58.291
Don't freak out and say how
great this is until I'm done.

02:59.967 --> 03:02.993
I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

03:03.270 --> 03:06.205
...who said that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

03:06.440 --> 03:09.637
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat."

03:11.678 --> 03:13.805
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.

03:15.616 --> 03:17.948
And she wants to do a video.

03:19.686 --> 03:21.847
I'm not done yet, okay?

03:22.189 --> 03:23.213
God!

03:24.825 --> 03:28.693
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

03:31.698 --> 03:32.528
I'm done now.

03:36.536 --> 03:39.972
If you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

03:40.173 --> 03:42.903
-Get the what?
-There's a pie in the hood. Go!

03:50.150 --> 03:50.980
What are you doing?

03:51.184 --> 03:54.085
I'm sorry.
My pie was in your hood.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.381
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

03:59.660 --> 04:02.094
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

04:08.168 --> 04:11.501
Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

04:12.205 --> 04:14.867
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

04:15.442 --> 04:18.377
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

04:19.846 --> 04:20.870
What's going on?

04:21.114 --> 04:23.548
Your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour!

04:23.750 --> 04:25.615
It's like I'm living with him again.

04:25.852 --> 04:29.686
He's here when I go to sleep and
wake up and when I want to shower.

04:29.923 --> 04:31.686
I feel like I'm 16 again.

04:31.892 --> 04:34.759
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

04:35.462 --> 04:36.929
Get out, you doofus!

04:39.700 --> 04:42.794
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

04:46.239 --> 04:47.706
All yours.

04:48.642 --> 04:51.372
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

04:53.814 --> 04:54.644
Shut up!

04:56.950 --> 04:58.542
Cut it out!

05:03.957 --> 05:06.152
I've never wanted you more.

05:40.152 --> 05:43.152
-Lui. Where is Howard?
-He went home.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.552
He said he might stop by after a shift.

05:47.152 --> 05:49.152
He said he tell you he don't feel so good.

05:51.152 --> 05:53.152
Hey what time do you get off?

05:54.552 --> 05:56.552
I'm not feel too good either.

06:04.237 --> 06:07.070
So what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

06:13.646 --> 06:15.045
You know what they say:

06:15.314 --> 06:17.509
Ask your slippers a question...

06:18.851 --> 06:20.580
...you're going crazy.

06:37.595 --> 06:40.086
I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

06:40.998 --> 06:42.295
That's okay.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.261
You had a thing.

06:45.102 --> 06:46.763
I hear the place looks great.

06:47.605 --> 06:50.574
Forget about it.
I'm having a ball!

06:51.242 --> 06:52.402
How's the apartment?

06:53.311 --> 06:56.109
It's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space-...

06:57.648 --> 06:58.740
...-fest!

07:01.152 --> 07:02.642
Well, great.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.852
Yeah, I just...

07:04.789 --> 07:06.689
...wanted to call and say hey.

07:08.392 --> 07:09.324
Well, okay.

07:10.795 --> 07:12.194
Was that the oven timer?

07:12.930 --> 07:14.261
That's right, my friend.

07:14.932 --> 07:16.365
It's time for...

07:16.634 --> 07:17.532
...Baywatch!

07:21.772 --> 07:24.138
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

07:24.508 --> 07:26.840
I can't believe
they made her lieutenant!

07:28.546 --> 07:31.276
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

07:31.482 --> 07:34.383
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

07:36.520 --> 07:37.782
Hey, they're running.

07:39.190 --> 07:42.023
See, this is the
brilliance of the show.

07:42.393 --> 07:44.122
I say always keep them running.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.461
All the time running!

07:48.199 --> 07:49.223
Run!

07:50.468 --> 07:51.457
Run!

07:51.669 --> 07:54.331
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

07:56.374 --> 07:58.308
But you wanted to live by yourself.

07:58.542 --> 08:01.067
I did. I thought it'd be great.

08:01.312 --> 08:04.577
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

08:04.815 --> 08:08.307
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you think.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.755
Why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

08:12.990 --> 08:14.924
You really think he'd take me?

08:15.159 --> 08:17.093
We had a good talk last night...

08:17.395 --> 08:19.556
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.321
He would definitely want you back.

08:22.566 --> 08:25.626
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

08:25.836 --> 08:29.363
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.269
I mean, it was

08:31.509 --> 08:34.444
It was like when we first
started living together.

08:34.879 --> 08:37.712
I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

08:38.015 --> 08:41.883
... but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.578
He's decorated.

08:46.524 --> 08:50.051
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

08:50.294 --> 08:54.025
You'll have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

08:54.265 --> 08:55.630
You're not...

08:56.367 --> 08:58.358
... roommates anymore.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.561
Okay, Phoebe.
You ready to try one?

09:04.909 --> 09:08.401
Smelly cat, smelly cat

09:08.646 --> 09:11.376
What are they feeding you?

09:11.916 --> 09:15.079
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

09:15.319 --> 09:16.411
Whoa! Oh, my God!

09:19.957 --> 09:21.720
I mean, like, who was that?

09:24.095 --> 09:27.758
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.732
I thought they were just watching me.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.267
Like at an aquarium, you know?

09:35.267 --> 09:37.472
You are so good, hi, you are so good.

09:37.472 --> 09:38.461
All right.

09:40.461 --> 09:43.708
Now everyone knows everyone.
Let's try it again.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.141
From the top.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.608
Smelly cat, smelly cat

09:48.814 --> 09:51.783
What are they feeding you?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.022
Okay, sorry.

09:58.457 --> 09:59.856
I'm just not getting...

10:00.158 --> 10:02.058
...that everyone gets...

10:02.294 --> 10:05.786
... how smelly
this cat actually is.

10:06.164 --> 10:07.859
Maybe if we could talk about this...

10:08.133 --> 10:11.625
... because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

10:14.206 --> 10:15.036
We can talk.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.175
It's just that this costs
$100 a minute to be in here.

10:18.977 --> 10:22.242
So the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

10:23.315 --> 10:26.682
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.749
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

10:29.054 --> 10:32.319
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

10:35.494 --> 10:36.654
Were you taking a nap?

10:36.862 --> 10:37.829
I was.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.663
Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

10:43.068 --> 10:46.037
Yeah, she's here,
but can she call you back?

10:46.338 --> 10:47.771
Okay, thanks.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.097
Call Joanna.

10:49.341 --> 10:50.365
Did she leave a number?

10:50.609 --> 10:52.907
Did you see me write one down?

10:54.346 --> 10:56.439
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

10:58.550 --> 11:00.745
She'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.283
You're the baby.

11:02.587 --> 11:04.782
-Get off my back.
-Get out of my face.

11:05.524 --> 11:07.685
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

11:11.429 --> 11:14.057
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.533
Tony, can I call you back?

11:17.769 --> 11:19.202
That's my sister's boyfriend.

11:19.604 --> 11:21.094
Give me that.

11:24.276 --> 11:28.144
Sweetie, before I forget, did l
leave my diaphragm at your place?

11:30.115 --> 11:30.945
Hi, Mom.

11:54.373 --> 11:55.397
So how's the palace?

11:56.408 --> 11:59.866
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking....

12:00.379 --> 12:02.176
What's with the boxes?

12:04.082 --> 12:06.516
Actually, I have some news.

12:06.852 --> 12:10.515
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

12:11.557 --> 12:15.459
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

12:15.694 --> 12:16.786
Nice to meet you.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.792
-Likewise.
-How you doing?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.127
I'll take that.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.628
It's what I came for.

12:25.304 --> 12:27.465
This is new.
Where'd you two meet?

12:27.739 --> 12:31.368
At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

12:31.643 --> 12:33.474
I helped him pick out a chorizo.

12:36.215 --> 12:40.276
We got to talking. He needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

12:41.653 --> 12:42.881
Now it's a spare room?

12:43.255 --> 12:45.985
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

12:46.291 --> 12:48.054
...and I have it to spare.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.826
Well, I got what I came for.

12:56.869 --> 12:57.801
I'll see you.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.796
Hey, Joe.

13:01.473 --> 13:03.964
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.470
Is this guy great, or what?

13:09.948 --> 13:11.313
Yeah, he is.

13:18.624 --> 13:20.922
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is he?

13:21.126 --> 13:22.855
Eddie. He just met him.

13:23.095 --> 13:26.553
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

13:30.402 --> 13:32.461
Check it out! Check it out!

13:32.704 --> 13:34.638
It's "Smelly Cat," the video!

13:36.909 --> 13:41.573
Now, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

13:41.780 --> 13:44.305
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

13:52.457 --> 13:56.484
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

14:04.403 --> 14:05.461
Smoking!

14:05.671 --> 14:06.638
Look at me!

14:06.905 --> 14:09.465
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:10.342 --> 14:13.175
What are they feeding you?

14:13.579 --> 14:17.106
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:17.349 --> 14:20.011
It's not your fault

14:24.089 --> 14:26.580
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

14:26.825 --> 14:28.452
It's not your fault

14:29.161 --> 14:31.493
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:31.697 --> 14:33.824
-Oh, my God!
-I know.

14:34.099 --> 14:36.090
I sound amazing!

14:39.438 --> 14:41.804
They won't take you to the vet

14:42.040 --> 14:44.338
You're obviously not their favorite pet

14:44.543 --> 14:47.034
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:47.279 --> 14:49.144
It's not your fault

14:52.517 --> 14:54.815
I've never heard myself sing before.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.284
I mean, except in my own head.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.651
This is so cool!
Now I can hear what you hear!

15:02.561 --> 15:04.552
Pretty different, huh?

15:05.797 --> 15:08.527
I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented!

15:10.369 --> 15:13.031
Smelly cat, smelly cat

15:13.238 --> 15:15.570
It's not your fault

15:26.185 --> 15:27.880
What's going on, man?

15:28.087 --> 15:28.917
Eddie.

15:29.288 --> 15:30.118
Morning.

15:32.091 --> 15:35.185
I just came by to pick up my mail.

15:36.128 --> 15:38.790
-Where's the mail?
-Over there on the table.

15:39.531 --> 15:41.590
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

15:41.867 --> 15:43.425
Eddie likes it over there.

15:47.539 --> 15:51.236
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs a la Eddie.

15:56.448 --> 15:58.109
That's great.

16:00.452 --> 16:01.476
What?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.551
I thought you liked your eggs...

16:03.789 --> 16:07.054
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, a la me!

16:07.493 --> 16:11.224
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

16:11.224 --> 16:12.630
Will you try some, there are some extra.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.930
-No, thanks!
-All right.

16:14.630 --> 16:15.722
Well, you guys...

16:16.565 --> 16:18.157
... I'm out of here.

16:18.834 --> 16:19.766
See you, pals.

16:19.969 --> 16:20.936
See you.

16:24.473 --> 16:27.601
-How are you two getting along?
-I couldn't be happier.

16:28.277 --> 16:29.301
Great.

16:29.678 --> 16:31.305
I'm happy for you.

16:34.850 --> 16:35.908
All right, that's it!

16:37.253 --> 16:40.984
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

16:43.092 --> 16:47.153
...with his moving the mail
and his "See you, pals."

16:49.965 --> 16:51.193
And now there's no juice!

16:51.434 --> 16:55.131
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

16:56.839 --> 16:58.636
There's another carton there.

17:00.543 --> 17:03.341
This isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

17:03.846 --> 17:04.710
All right.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.004
So what's it about?

17:06.315 --> 17:07.145
Eggs!

17:08.384 --> 17:11.114
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine?

17:11.320 --> 17:13.982
-Well, I like both eggs equally.
-Oh, come on!

17:14.557 --> 17:18.857
Nobody likes two eggs equally.
I wanna know which one you like better.

17:19.128 --> 17:21.688
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

17:23.466 --> 17:25.730
You took your eggs and you left!

17:26.168 --> 17:28.796
Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

17:29.796 --> 17:32.796
Maybe this is not about the eggs.

17:33.696 --> 17:35.696
Maybe it's about the chicken that lay them.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.796
What chicken, there is no chicken.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.340
I can't talk to you.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.035
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

17:50.309 --> 17:52.869
Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

17:54.213 --> 17:55.373
Would you guys stop!

17:55.581 --> 17:57.481
It's my TV!

17:57.816 --> 18:00.046
-Quit it!
-Bite me!

18:00.352 --> 18:03.014
Monica keeps changing the channel.

18:03.255 --> 18:05.985
That's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

18:06.391 --> 18:09.258
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

18:09.528 --> 18:11.553
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

18:11.763 --> 18:15.028
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

18:15.234 --> 18:18.203
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

18:18.437 --> 18:21.338
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

18:24.209 --> 18:25.733
What do we do about this?

18:25.944 --> 18:27.912
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

18:28.113 --> 18:29.080
Not that!

18:29.348 --> 18:31.111
This! Us!

18:31.416 --> 18:33.850
Oh, my God, Ross, it's....
You're just....

18:34.086 --> 18:36.680
Since you've been here,
you're driving me....

18:36.889 --> 18:39.949
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

18:40.559 --> 18:43.585
I just can't stand you being here...

18:43.795 --> 18:44.853
...all the time!

18:45.097 --> 18:48.294
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

18:48.534 --> 18:49.728
We're just having fun.

18:49.935 --> 18:52.597
Fun? You think this is fun?

18:53.939 --> 18:57.431
I thought we were fooling around,
like when we were kids.

18:57.643 --> 18:59.474
I hated you when we were kids!

19:01.880 --> 19:03.438
You hated me when we were kids?

19:03.982 --> 19:04.949
I hated you.

19:05.150 --> 19:07.618
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-l-have-to way...

19:07.819 --> 19:09.787
... but basically, I hated your guts.

19:11.390 --> 19:12.550
Why did you hate me?

19:12.758 --> 19:15.727
Because you were mean to me...

19:15.928 --> 19:19.295
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.657
That wasn't fun for you?

19:27.005 --> 19:28.905
I can't believe you hated me.

19:30.842 --> 19:32.639
But now I love you.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.648
And not just because I have to.

19:37.316 --> 19:38.305
Really?

19:40.819 --> 19:43.617
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

19:48.460 --> 19:49.518
I can do that.

19:50.362 --> 19:52.455
Then I won't have to kill you.

19:55.634 --> 19:59.126
So you wanna watch
Entertainment Tonight?.

19:59.338 --> 20:00.430
Thanks.

20:04.009 --> 20:05.169
You know what?

20:06.845 --> 20:10.372
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

20:20.192 --> 20:22.626
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

20:24.029 --> 20:26.293
...but that is not me
singing on the video.

20:30.702 --> 20:32.192
How did you find out?

20:32.471 --> 20:36.840
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

20:37.042 --> 20:40.637
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

20:41.747 --> 20:42.805
What will you do?

20:43.048 --> 20:45.482
I can't work with people
who would do this.

20:45.817 --> 20:46.875
Sure.

20:47.085 --> 20:48.518
I mean, this poor woman.

20:49.855 --> 20:50.685
What woman?

20:50.922 --> 20:52.184
The voice woman.

20:52.424 --> 20:55.257
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

20:56.061 --> 20:58.188
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

20:58.397 --> 21:00.365
I have a video. Pay attention.

21:03.735 --> 21:06.898
This voice woman, she's so talented.

21:07.105 --> 21:12.042
But according to the producer people,
she doesn't have the right look.

21:12.344 --> 21:15.074
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

21:15.280 --> 21:17.748
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

21:18.016 --> 21:22.385
Or you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and

21:22.621 --> 21:24.589
Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"!

21:28.126 --> 21:30.094
That song has so many levels.

21:32.898 --> 21:33.796
Hey, Eddie.

21:34.232 --> 21:36.097
You wanna play some foosball?

21:36.301 --> 21:38.929
No, thanks, man.
I'm not really into sports.

21:44.609 --> 21:46.372
Yeah, okay. All right.

21:48.213 --> 21:51.114
Doesn't matter.
Time for Baywatch!

21:52.984 --> 21:54.281
You like that show?

21:56.955 --> 21:57.979
You don't?

22:00.058 --> 22:03.118
It's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

22:03.895 --> 22:05.920
That's the brilliance of it.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.096
The pretty people.

22:11.470 --> 22:12.994
And the running.

22:14.940 --> 22:17.807
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

22:19.111 --> 22:20.510
Okay, man.

22:30.989 --> 22:34.925
I think of all the friends I've known

22:37.362 --> 22:40.525
But when I dial the telephone

22:43.602 --> 22:45.763
No one's home

22:53.845 --> 22:58.782
All by myself

23:00.318 --> 23:01.945
Don't wanna live

23:02.187 --> 23:06.351
All by myself

23:07.325 --> 23:09.316
Anymore

23:10.462 --> 23:14.489
All by myself

23:18.489 --> 23:21.489
I'm gonna sort off with a little song called smelly cat.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.489
For those of you who wondering this is my real voice.

23:28.201 --> 23:30.931
Smelly cat, smelly cat

23:31.204 --> 23:34.071
What are they feeding you?
Everybody!

23:34.274 --> 23:37.107
Smelly cat, smelly cat

23:37.377 --> 23:39.572
It's not your fault

23:40.613 --> 23:42.638
They won't take you to the vet

23:46.920 --> 23:49.480
You're obviously not
their favorite pet

23:50.390 --> 23:53.052
You may not be a bed of roses

23:53.393 --> 23:56.760
And you're no friend
To those with noses

23:57.397 --> 24:00.924
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Back to the chorus!
