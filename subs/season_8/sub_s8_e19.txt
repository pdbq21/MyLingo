00:01.801 --> 00:06.704
Hi. So I'm doing the Soap Opera Digest
crossword puzzle..

00:06.906 --> 00:10.637
and guess who is the clue
for three down?

00:10.844 --> 00:14.439
"Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."

00:14.647 --> 00:17.582
That's me! I'm blank!

00:18.284 --> 00:22.220
How cool! We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.083
Yeah, you are, baby.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.226
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?

00:28.428 --> 00:31.022
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

00:31.264 --> 00:34.927
No. They wanted to do
a profile on me. I said no.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.534
Why'd you say no?

00:36.770 --> 00:39.364
Remember the last interview I did?

00:39.606 --> 00:43.007
I said I write my own lines,
the writers got mad..

00:43.243 --> 00:47.942
and I fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what I'd say now?

00:48.148 --> 00:52.812
If only there was something
in your head to control what you say.

00:53.019 --> 00:56.113
Come on, you'll keep it
in check this time.

00:56.322 --> 01:00.691
The publicity would be good for you.
You deserve that.

01:00.894 --> 01:06.457
In the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

01:06.666 --> 01:10.796
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

01:11.538 --> 01:16.566
-Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
-Fine, all right, I'll do it.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.974
You have to be there to stop me
if I say something stupid.

01:21.181 --> 01:26.050
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

01:26.986 --> 01:30.513
We'll be there the whole time.
Just remember:

01:30.723 --> 01:33.988
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

01:34.694 --> 01:40.655
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!
And not just in the dumb crossword.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.062
Seriously, proud of you.

02:21.708 --> 02:28.113
-Thanks for taking the time for this.
-Not at all. Happy to do it.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.613
You think we're being obvious?

02:30.817 --> 02:36.119
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.483
It's great that we met here.

02:38.725 --> 02:44.721
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.723
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

02:49.102 --> 02:53.801
Wouldn't have mattered. I do this
for the fans, not the free food.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.498
-Can I get you anything?
-Coffee.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.735
And I'll have all the muffins.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.973
-Hey.
-We're not talking.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.483
Oh, finally.

03:09.189 --> 03:13.649
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.261
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

03:19.365 --> 03:22.664
All you want is a dingle

03:22.869 --> 03:25.838
What you envy's a shwang

03:26.072 --> 03:29.337
A thing through which you can tinkle

03:29.542 --> 03:32.534
Or play with, or simply let hang

03:47.193 --> 03:50.560
This ever happen?
You want a glass of milk..

03:50.797 --> 03:53.994
but these darn cartons
are so hard to open!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.065
Boy, you said it, Mike.

03:58.638 --> 04:02.335
-There 's gotta be a better way!
- There is, Kevin!

04:02.542 --> 04:06.876
This is the first time
he's ever used this. It's easy.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.843
-This works in any milk carton.
-It is easy.

04:11.050 --> 04:14.542
Now I can have milk every day.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.651
So this is it, Victor?

04:18.324 --> 04:22.818
Yeah, I guess it is. And so..

04:24.364 --> 04:27.856
I'm gonna get on this spaceship..

04:34.207 --> 04:39.167
and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

04:39.445 --> 04:45.941
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.745
But I won't have aged at all.

04:51.858 --> 04:56.921
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.091
Because, Adrian..

05:01.367 --> 05:03.130
baby..

05:04.470 --> 05:07.200
I'm gonna want to meet her.

05:15.214 --> 05:18.615
Here I come.
I'm coming to fix the copier.

05:18.818 --> 05:23.346
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

05:24.357 --> 05:29.761
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say.. Wait, here's my line:

05:29.962 --> 05:33.261
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.403
-Nice work, my friend.
-Wait, you see me again.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.698
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.036
There I am. There I am. There I am.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.981
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.346
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?

05:53.553 --> 05:57.751
-A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
-Double latte.

05:57.957 --> 06:01.484
-A bagel with only..
-I was just being polite.

06:02.862 --> 06:07.856
How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?

06:09.569 --> 06:14.506
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.

06:14.741 --> 06:18.177
Get out of the way, jackass!

06:18.911 --> 06:22.574
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

06:23.983 --> 06:25.883
That is the Coast Guard.

06:26.085 --> 06:30.681
What are they doing out here?
The coast is way over there!

06:31.391 --> 06:33.325
This is unbelievable.

06:33.526 --> 06:38.429
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

06:42.335 --> 06:45.270
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

06:51.144 --> 06:54.602
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.944
-Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
-Come on, it's fun!

07:01.988 --> 07:03.922
All right.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.625
Isn't this a woman's hat?

07:12.832 --> 07:16.359
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.134
We have to turn off the porn.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.465
I think you're right.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.540
-All right, ready?
-One.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.510
-Two, three.
-Three.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.444
That's kind of nice.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.987
-It's kind of a relief.
-Yeah.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.758
-You wanna see if we still have it?
-Yeah.

07:48.534 --> 07:51.196
Free porn! We have free porn here!

07:51.604 --> 07:54.732
In my spare time, I read to the blind.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.273
And I'm also a mento for kids.

07:59.111 --> 08:02.512
-A mento?
-You know, a mento. A role model.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.476
-A mento?
-Right.

08:07.687 --> 08:11.214
-Like the candy?
-As a matter of fact, I do.

08:13.559 --> 08:19.361
Our readers always want to know how
soap stars stay in such great shape.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.999
Do you have a fitness regime?

08:22.201 --> 08:27.002
We stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

08:27.573 --> 08:31.942
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?

08:32.144 --> 08:33.406
Are you serious?

08:33.613 --> 08:38.778
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to jinx it.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.579
-Wow, we are pretty good at this.
-Yeah.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.621
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

08:45.825 --> 08:49.317
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.531
My pants are a little loose.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.500
What's wrong with you?

08:55.668 --> 09:00.662
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.569
And then I passed out.

09:03.776 --> 09:08.975
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's serious.

09:09.181 --> 09:12.082
Sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

09:12.351 --> 09:13.613
No way!

09:13.819 --> 09:19.451
If I go to the doctor, it's for this
thing sticking out of my stomach!

09:21.627 --> 09:24.824
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.658
Damn you, fifteens!

09:27.867 --> 09:30.836
-What is it?
-A trifle. It has layers.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.437
A layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.871
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

09:38.110 --> 09:42.877
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sauteed with peas and onions.

09:43.115 --> 09:46.016
Then a little bit more custard.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.143
It tastes like feet.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.456
I like it.

09:56.195 --> 10:00.222
-Are you kidding?
-What's not to like? Custard, good.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.458
Jam, good. Meat, good!

10:05.972 --> 10:08.873
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

10:10.042 --> 10:13.978
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.808
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.712
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

10:19.919 --> 10:22.854
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.853
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

10:26.058 --> 10:29.687
-Stick to your side.
-Hey, come on, now.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.864
All right, what are we having?

10:47.346 --> 10:52.682
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.

10:52.885 --> 10:54.682
Your muffins.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.782
I'll take those to go.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.356
For the kids.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.556
I know what I wanted to ask.

11:04.764 --> 11:08.757
They killed you off years ago.
What happened there?

11:08.968 --> 11:13.302
I said some stuff in an interview
I shouldn't have said.

11:13.539 --> 11:17.737
-But that is not gonna happen today.
-Understood.

11:17.943 --> 11:21.879
-So, what'd you say back then?
-I said that I..

11:22.081 --> 11:25.050
-Hey, Joey!
-How you doing?

11:27.319 --> 11:32.052
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.
Shelly, these are my friends.

11:32.224 --> 11:37.218
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
If you want the dirt, come to me.

11:37.430 --> 11:41.298
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

11:41.767 --> 11:46.067
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

11:46.272 --> 11:50.504
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.440
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.082
-You're doing great.
-So far, nothing stupid.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.308
-Mento?
-No, thanks.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.514
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.718
No, just that he is a great guy.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.898
That'll get you
into Soap Opera Digest.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.532
Well, I..

12:14.734 --> 12:16.895
I'd like to say that Joey..

12:17.103 --> 12:21.802
truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

12:22.341 --> 12:26.835
I think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

12:27.079 --> 12:31.641
-I like that. What's your name?
-Phoebe Buffay.

12:31.851 --> 12:37.118
-How do you spell that?
-It's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.587
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

12:39.792 --> 12:44.786
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "ello there, mate!"

12:45.131 --> 12:47.861
Great. It was nice meeting you.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.864
-Yeah, you too.
-Thanks.

12:51.604 --> 12:56.166
It seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?

13:00.079 --> 13:02.445
How come you have two?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.613
Well, this one's for you.

13:05.818 --> 13:08.651
-Get out!
-No, I can't.

13:10.122 --> 13:15.150
I know how much this means to you.
This isn't just about jewelry.

13:15.361 --> 13:20.594
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

13:21.901 --> 13:25.632
Is this friendship? I think so!

13:25.838 --> 13:28.739
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

13:28.974 --> 13:31.499
That's what they'll call us!

13:33.746 --> 13:37.614
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right. Don't worry about it.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.308
That's gonna leave a stain.

13:40.519 --> 13:44.512
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

13:45.057 --> 13:47.685
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.532
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know!

14:00.139 --> 14:04.166
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

14:04.743 --> 14:07.871
I feel guilty.
I wanna be a good friend..

14:08.080 --> 14:12.915
and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.150
You are a good friend.

14:20.359 --> 14:24.193
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

14:24.930 --> 14:30.163
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

14:32.404 --> 14:36.704
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.774
And they're off!

14:39.311 --> 14:42.280
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge!

14:42.481 --> 14:45.177
Judge rules: No violation.

14:45.718 --> 14:51.122
-The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
-No! That's just an old won ton.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.951
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.422
Tough call.

14:57.796 --> 15:03.598
-I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
-Wait a minute. I saw that!

15:03.802 --> 15:06.771
Yeah, about jellyfish,
and how if you..

15:11.443 --> 15:13.741
You peed on yourself?

15:15.147 --> 15:18.514
You can't say that! You don't know!

15:18.751 --> 15:21.811
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.515
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.925
So..

15:36.468 --> 15:39.733
That's right, I stepped up!

15:41.807 --> 15:44.935
She's my friend and she needed help!

15:45.144 --> 15:48.773
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you!

15:52.484 --> 15:55.112
Nope. No best friend.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.256
Just a lot of close friends.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.785
So now back to the show.

16:01.994 --> 16:06.192
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

16:06.398 --> 16:08.559
Really? Me?

16:08.834 --> 16:12.998
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

16:13.205 --> 16:16.834
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

16:17.276 --> 16:21.576
Now, off the record, you're not..

16:22.147 --> 16:25.913
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

16:26.652 --> 16:30.144
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.

16:30.356 --> 16:34.486
It's got compartments for stuff:
your wallet, your keys.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.888
Your makeup.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.689
Should I climb down your front
so we're face to face..

16:41.900 --> 16:47.429
or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

16:47.873 --> 16:50.364
-I think face is best.
-Yeah, face.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.744
-Okay, here I come.
-All right.

16:57.349 --> 17:01.046
Oh, my..
How much do you weigh, Ross?

17:01.320 --> 17:06.587
I prefer not to answer that. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

17:13.832 --> 17:19.737
When we said "face to face," we didn't
think it all the way through!

17:19.938 --> 17:21.963
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hey.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.435
Check it out.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.148
How much of a man am I?

17:34.420 --> 17:38.948
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.555
You're turning into a woman.

17:41.960 --> 17:47.091
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?
That's just mean!

17:48.367 --> 17:51.063
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

17:51.270 --> 17:55.070
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.368
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

18:07.286 --> 18:10.778
-Great nap.
-It really was.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.533
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

18:26.805 --> 18:30.263
But I have a number
of close friends who are.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.836
So let's talk about women.

18:35.047 --> 18:38.983
I'm sure our female readers are
interested in your romantic life.

18:39.184 --> 18:42.950
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

18:43.155 --> 18:46.921
"Hey. How you doing?"

18:48.994 --> 18:50.621
Oh, please.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.832
Hey. How you doing?

18:58.303 --> 19:01.033
Hey. How you doing?

19:01.240 --> 19:04.141
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

19:04.376 --> 19:08.938
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.584
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

19:18.323 --> 19:21.850
-Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
-Oh, my God! Jill!

19:22.060 --> 19:24.153
-Oh, my God! Rachel!
-Oh, hi!

19:24.363 --> 19:28.595
-Oh, my God! Introduce us!
-Well, this is Chandler.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.702
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.170
-Hey, how you doing?
-Don't!

19:38.677 --> 19:43.740
You're a really nice guy. I'm happy
to be your roommate and friend.

19:43.982 --> 19:49.113
I'm just.. You know, I just
don't feel that way about you.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.017
I see what happened.

19:54.226 --> 19:57.855
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

19:58.063 --> 20:03.501
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.603
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.901
How you doing?

20:12.811 --> 20:14.711
I'm okay.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.073
What? Oh, dear God!

20:22.087 --> 20:25.579
Not much to tell there.
I'm really shy.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.959
So that's it.
I guess that's all I need.

20:31.163 --> 20:35.327
Thank you so much.
I think they'll run this next month.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.593
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.238
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.736
-I did it.
-Amazing.

20:44.943 --> 20:49.107
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

20:49.314 --> 20:52.841
Other than Days,
what's your favorite soap opera?

20:53.085 --> 20:58.853
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

21:00.259 --> 21:05.196
The readers at Soap Opera Digest
will be happy to learn that.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.091
Good enough.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.463
So close.

21:16.975 --> 21:21.207
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.

21:21.413 --> 21:26.077
I called the lady and said l
was joking. She was nice about it.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.550
-You slept with her, didn't you?
-A little bit.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.724
This picture of you is steamy.

21:33.925 --> 21:38.328
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

21:38.497 --> 21:41.796
-Did you just wink at me?
-You're the one who loves the picture.
