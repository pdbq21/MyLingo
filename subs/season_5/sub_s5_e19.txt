WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.666
Wow! You look nice.
What's the occasion?

00:06.873 --> 00:09.569
Monica and I are celebrating
our 10-month anniversary.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.505
Got reservations at Jean-George.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.069
How'd you get in?

00:13.279 --> 00:15.338
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

00:15.548 --> 00:19.609
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.681
-Hi, Chandler.
-Hey, Caitlin.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.085
Somebody got a haircut.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.692
I hate it. I look like
an 8-year-old boy.

00:28.895 --> 00:32.592
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.735
-It's $27 even.
-Okay. Here you go.

00:38.938 --> 00:39.962
Where's the chicken?

00:40.240 --> 00:43.038
It's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.207
He said that eggs came first.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.037
-Thanks. I'll see you later.
-Bye.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.714
What the hell was that?

00:54.454 --> 00:55.921
-What?
-The flirting.

00:56.156 --> 00:59.648
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, let's see, my sister?

01:00.627 --> 01:01.616
I wasn't flirting.

01:01.828 --> 01:06.322
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut...."

01:08.401 --> 01:11.564
First of all, the impression?
Uncanny.

01:12.272 --> 01:16.265
Second, that wasn't flirting.
That was just casual conversation.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.074
Yeah, right.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.508
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.013
I'm good.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.945
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt

02:12.198 --> 02:13.665
I am so proud of Joey.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.960
-He's gonna be on Law and Order!
-I know.

02:16.202 --> 02:19.501
Don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?

02:19.706 --> 02:22.436
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.336
Don't get me started on that.

02:26.045 --> 02:29.344
-I was not flirting.
-And on your anniversary. For shame!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.139
What's going on?

02:31.351 --> 02:33.546
He was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.444
I was not. And oh, God!

02:37.490 --> 02:40.391
You were. If anyone
should be hitting on her...

02:40.627 --> 02:42.458
...it's the guy who's single...

02:42.729 --> 02:44.822
...the guy who can do
something about it.

02:45.031 --> 02:48.125
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

02:50.537 --> 02:53.131
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

02:55.642 --> 02:59.738
Ross, we broke up two years ago.
You've been married since then.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.412
I think it's okay
that we see other people.

03:04.217 --> 03:07.084
I was watching her
at the pizza place.

03:07.387 --> 03:11.983
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little

03:12.225 --> 03:14.193
We don't need her measurements.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.530
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.392
She's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

03:22.168 --> 03:23.760
She forgot my vegetarian.

03:24.437 --> 03:28.373
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

03:28.575 --> 03:32.909
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

03:33.746 --> 03:36.237
I am so glad you don't eat meat.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.575
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

03:40.353 --> 03:44.153
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.382
-Big night!
-Yeah, it's so cool.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.788
Joey on Law and Order.
You must be proud.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.693
She doesn't understand
a word of English.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.365
I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.236
I've done it again.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.231
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

04:02.475 --> 04:06.104
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.611
Si. Big star.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.944
My big fat Joey star.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.057
Yeah, I weighed, like,
27 pounds when I was born.

04:23.830 --> 04:27.561
-Happy anniversary!
-Happy anniversary, 10 months.

04:28.901 --> 04:32.268
In the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.565
Joey's grandmother's right there.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.334
-The one who speaks English?
-The one who doesn't.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.841
That was some hot love you gave me.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.281
-I'll get ready.
-Wear those earrings I got you.

04:43.516 --> 04:47.145
That's a great idea. I was saving
them for something special.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.582
-You've got to go home.
-But I like it here.

04:53.993 --> 04:57.121
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

04:57.330 --> 05:01.323
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.964
I need those earrings you borrowed.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.007
Yeah, I'll be right back.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.180
Phoebe, you speak ltalian?

05:25.491 --> 05:26.651
I guess so.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.221
-Here you go.
-Thanks. Where's the other one?

05:33.800 --> 05:38.669
Oh, what, you want both of them?
That's a little greedy, don't you think?

05:38.838 --> 05:41.432
Rachel Karen Greene,
where's the other one?

05:41.607 --> 05:44.633
Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.336
I know it's in the apartment,
but I definitely lost it.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.907
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

05:52.118 --> 05:55.485
-Tell her to wear her own earrings.
-These are her earrings.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.991
You lent me her earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

06:03.496 --> 06:05.691
-Why not?
-Because I lose her stuff!

06:13.840 --> 06:17.503
You see that blind guy?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.

06:20.012 --> 06:23.709
My big scene's coming up.
The big scene coming up.

06:23.983 --> 06:28.317
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up,"
would she know the difference?

06:30.656 --> 06:31.953
What are you doing?

06:32.492 --> 06:35.461
Oh, I just can't watch.
It's too scary.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.129
It's a diaper commercial.

06:39.232 --> 06:43.293
Yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities....

06:45.671 --> 06:49.129
-Pizza delivery.
-I'll get it! I will get that!

06:51.644 --> 06:53.009
How does my hair look?

06:53.146 --> 06:56.604
Ross, it hasn't moved since 1996.

07:01.954 --> 07:05.151
One vegetarian pizza.
It's 12.50.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.160
By the way, if it makes
you feel any better...

07:09.362 --> 07:11.489
...I happen to like
8-year-old boys.

07:15.835 --> 07:16.824
What?

07:19.739 --> 07:21.707
Your hair.
Before. Your hair.

07:21.941 --> 07:26.002
You said you thought your hair
looked like an 8-year-old boy's...

07:26.245 --> 07:28.372
...and I'm just saying I like it.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.078
The hair.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.779
Thanks.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.886
You understand, I don't actually
like 8-year-old boys.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.053
All I'm looking for is the money.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.955
Here you go.
Stop bringing us pizzas, you.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.599
I'm gonna try.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.364
You're welcome.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.870
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

07:57.109 --> 08:01.045
This is a girl I really like,
and you had to swoop in there!

08:01.247 --> 08:02.236
What?

08:02.381 --> 08:05.214
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.279
Thank you for that.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.582
I was not flirting.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.759
It's okay. I don't care.
That's fine.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.924
Really?

08:16.596 --> 08:19.429
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.733
You flirt with guys all the time?

08:25.338 --> 08:29.502
It doesn't mean anything. Just like
it doesn't mean anything with you.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.141
There's a difference.
You're a lot hotter.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.607
True story.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.747
This actually bothers you?

08:36.983 --> 08:39.474
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.344
When you and Ross dated...

08:41.587 --> 08:44.647
...did it bother you
when he flirted with other women?

08:44.857 --> 08:48.190
No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.829
And thank you for that.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.832
I never had to worry.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.298
He was never good
at the flirting thing.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.308
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.671
No, you're right.

09:06.946 --> 09:11.474
We met, you flirted and then bam!
Nine years later, you had me.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.879
All right.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.180
You know what I'll do?
I'll order another pizza.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.517
And when Caitlin gets here...

09:19.825 --> 09:22.623
...I will show you how well I flirt.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.853
I will get her phone number.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.622
And not the one on the menu.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.036
-I found it.
-Thank God! Where was it?

09:33.205 --> 09:34.194
On your dresser.

09:34.473 --> 09:37.636
Okay, that is the one we already have.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.508
Here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

09:41.047 --> 09:44.141
-Wanna bet nobody heard anything?
-No bet.

09:45.384 --> 09:46.578
Anybody home?

09:47.153 --> 09:48.916
-Oh, my God.
-What?

09:49.188 --> 09:53.522
Everybody keep smiling. It'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out.

09:53.659 --> 09:54.648
What is it?

09:54.827 --> 09:56.692
They cut me out of the show.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.890
What?

09:59.198 --> 10:01.598
-Are you sure?
-Maybe your scene's coming up.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.995
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.530
I'm in it.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.439
This is terrible.
What'll you do?

10:10.710 --> 10:13.941
I don't know. This little
old lady lives for my career.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.479
When they dumped me off
Days of Our Lives, she almost died.

10:17.650 --> 10:18.639
That's not good.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.947
-Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse.
-Oh, my God.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.079
Yeah, she almost died
and got really expensive.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.856
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Everybody smile!

10:29.729 --> 10:33.165
Just tell her what happened.
It's not your fault.

10:33.366 --> 10:37.029
If we keep talking this way,
won't we freak her out soon?

10:40.172 --> 10:42.572
Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.241
There I am!

10:46.746 --> 10:48.646
Sam Waterston!

10:48.881 --> 10:50.974
No, no. That's me.
That's me!

10:51.250 --> 10:53.377
No. Sam Waterston.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.419
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.716
She doesn't know "hello,"
but she knows Capricorn One.

11:00.926 --> 11:04.521
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.862
But I already gave them back to you.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.025
No, you didn't.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.900
I already didn't gave them back to you.
That's what I said.

11:16.442 --> 11:17.932
Where's that other earring?

11:18.210 --> 11:20.337
It's not here, Phoebe.
It's not here.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.513
I went to Chandler's last night.

11:22.715 --> 11:25.206
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.411
Chandler has a jewelry box?

11:29.922 --> 11:33.221
We have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to get into that now?

11:38.297 --> 11:39.730
Hey, Phoebe.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.598
How's that...

11:41.901 --> 11:45.200
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you?

11:47.239 --> 11:49.764
You and those vegetables
have a real...

11:49.975 --> 11:52.034
...thing going on, huh?

11:54.814 --> 11:56.611
Why are you being weird?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.540
Do you like it?

12:01.787 --> 12:03.778
No. That'd be,
"Why are you being cute?"

12:05.157 --> 12:07.216
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.621
I did not get that.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.061
So, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?

12:14.266 --> 12:15.426
Yeah, it's good.

12:15.634 --> 12:18.728
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...

12:18.971 --> 12:22.270
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.634
Okay, let me get this straight.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.781
It's okay for you to flirt,
but not for me?

12:29.982 --> 12:31.643
I'm glad we cleared that up.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.248
I'm sorry, but some things are
different for men and women.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.251
Teach me about men and women.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.654
I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

12:42.628 --> 12:45.426
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."

12:45.664 --> 12:49.191
But he thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

12:49.602 --> 12:51.365
-No way!
-It's true.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.606
-Well, that's pathetic.
-Again, true.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.769
-This goes for all guys?
-All guys that are awake.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.634
We go to sleep.

13:00.846 --> 13:04.839
All guys from the other end of the
world wake up and act the same way.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.019
It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.122
Joey, this is the last commercial.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.258
-You got 10 minutes left.
-I know!

13:14.460 --> 13:16.121
What am I gonna do?

13:16.562 --> 13:18.860
You will not run out
and leave her here.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.396
Yeah, all right.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.575
Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.842
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.342
So you're old and small.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.455
-Did you find it?
-The earring, no.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.120
But I found my sunglasses.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.993
I've been looking for these
since last summer.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.163
Those are mine.
You borrowed them from me.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.171
Okay. Calm down.
Here they are.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.675
-What do we do?
-I don't know. I don't know!

14:09.915 --> 14:12.679
We'll just have
to tell Monica, that's all.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.887
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.847
I could tell her it was all my fault.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.582
Oh, that'd be great.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.056
Mon, could I talk to you?

14:25.331 --> 14:26.923
Yeah. What is it?

14:28.267 --> 14:30.235
I lost one of your earrings.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.428
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

14:36.775 --> 14:40.404
All right, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

14:40.679 --> 14:43.614
I'll replace it. I promise.
I feel so terrible.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.579
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.852
Look at you. Come here.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.684
-You feel better?
-Yeah. You're the best.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.952
Okay, wait a minute.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.027
I can't do this.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.598
Listen, honey,
it's not Phoebe's fault.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.526
She lent me the earrings.

15:04.770 --> 15:08.262
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.

15:09.942 --> 15:13.070
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!

15:14.580 --> 15:17.481
First, my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.980
And if it's not that,
it's my sunglasses.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.117
Your sunglasses?

15:22.388 --> 15:24.083
Oh, right.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.658
-Pizza.
-Mine, mine, mine!

15:29.328 --> 15:30.556
Okay, here goes.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.992
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.757
Okay, hold on.

15:39.238 --> 15:44.403
If you really like this girl, I don't
think flirting is the right way

15:46.111 --> 15:47.840
You'll see.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.444
What's her name?

15:53.152 --> 15:54.983
Caitlin!

16:03.495 --> 16:06.089
We can't keep eating like this.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.997
It's $12.50.

16:16.709 --> 16:21.373
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those wood-burning ovens?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.849
No, actually, I think they're gas.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.278
Gas?

16:30.456 --> 16:31.480
Intense.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.652
If this is how all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.225
You know that smell gas has?

16:48.207 --> 16:50.038
They put that in.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.203
-What?
-The gas is odorless.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.974
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.214
Well, okay.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.254
A lot of other gas smells.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.230
Oh, the humanity!

17:17.703 --> 17:20.433
Methane smells....

17:21.673 --> 17:25.006
You know what?
Actually, I really should go.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.179
-But I haven't paid you yet.
-That's okay.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.349
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.788
Was I talking to her about gas?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.728
More so than anything else.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.901
I found it interesting.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.661
I'm sorry.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.968
Don't worry about it.

17:57.242 --> 18:01.303
In nine years, she and l
will be right there!

18:07.786 --> 18:10.584
I'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.061
What else do they add smell to?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.629
Caitlin! Caitlin!

18:27.906 --> 18:29.669
Hi, I'm Rachel.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.274
The people with all the pizza.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.968
Was there a problem?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.180
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.440
But, actually, my friend Ross...

18:39.585 --> 18:43.419
...he gets nervous when he's flirting.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.116
Oh, my God!

18:45.324 --> 18:47.417
That was flirting?

18:48.293 --> 18:49.988
I know, I know.

18:50.195 --> 18:53.460
I'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

18:53.665 --> 18:56.099
...where it feels
like you wanna die...

18:56.335 --> 18:58.303
...he's a really good person.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.768
The guy with the gas?

19:01.306 --> 19:04.537
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

19:04.776 --> 19:06.835
...and he's just got a good heart.

19:06.979 --> 19:11.746
You know, actually, I did think that
he was cute and then he started talking.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.150
See, there you go.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.381
-Besides, I think he really likes you.
-Really?

19:19.591 --> 19:23.550
Well, we have seven people
and 10 pizzas. What do you think?

19:23.929 --> 19:26.591
I thought Joey was there.

19:28.167 --> 19:32.194
Yeah, no, but just I'm telling you
he's worth a shot.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.670
Well, if he's so great
why don't you go out with him?

19:38.644 --> 19:41.044
Well, you know, at some point...

19:41.180 --> 19:45.207
...you and I may need
to have a longer conversation.

19:50.789 --> 19:51.778
Hey, Ross?

19:52.758 --> 19:55.352
I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

19:55.594 --> 19:59.360
You must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.658
-What?
-I don't get it, but she wanted me...

20:01.800 --> 20:04.132
...to give you her number.

20:09.074 --> 20:10.871
And she just gave you this?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.774
Rach, thanks. But I don't need
you doing me any favors.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.451
I didn't.
She thought you were cute.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.115
Well, that I can believe.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.382
Hey, is the show still on?

20:28.594 --> 20:29.788
Almost over, man.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.461
Hey, Nonnie.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.759
Is that the pope?

20:36.501 --> 20:38.093
Why am I looking?

20:38.837 --> 20:40.998
Oh, here I am!
This is my big scene.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.504
All right, back off!

20:45.477 --> 20:47.274
I got a gun!

20:47.746 --> 20:49.179
I'm not afraid to use it.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.081
That's right, Nonnie.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.785
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

20:56.655 --> 21:00.614
Now, I want a suitcase
filled with $ 100,000

21:03.161 --> 21:05.527
Filled with $ 100,000
in small bills.

21:05.797 --> 21:07.924
And if I don't get
Shoo!

21:08.634 --> 21:10.431
And if I don't get it...

21:12.204 --> 21:13.637
...I'll shoot this duck!

21:14.306 --> 21:15.432
Oh, no!

21:16.975 --> 21:18.966
I'm coming out!

21:26.785 --> 21:28.514
And she's supposed to buy this?

21:33.058 --> 21:35.856
Ground control to Major Tom

21:38.130 --> 21:39.961
Commencing countdown

21:40.232 --> 21:41.893
Engines

21:42.467 --> 21:43.456
On

21:50.409 --> 21:53.207
That's scenes from next week's show.
Next week.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.308
I am definitely gonna watch that.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.382
Do these look the same?

22:04.589 --> 22:06.614
-Definitely.
-Not as each other.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.622
Then, no.

22:11.396 --> 22:13.330
-Hey, you ready?
-Yeah.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.625
You look amazing.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.429
You're about to get
a little luckier.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.401
-Let me see the earrings.
-Right, the earrings.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.233
They look great.

22:24.476 --> 22:27.570
Does your boyfriend have
the best taste or what?

22:28.613 --> 22:31.980
My boyfriend really does
have great taste.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.050
Thanks for picking out the earrings.
