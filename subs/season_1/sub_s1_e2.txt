00:01.868 --> 00:03.301
You don't understand.

00:03.503 --> 00:06.529
For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.207
Yeah, right!

00:10.877 --> 00:12.071
You serious?

00:13.079 --> 00:14.068
Oh, yeah.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.750
- Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
- Absolutely.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.511
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much

00:20.720 --> 00:23.848
like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's
like the stand-up comedian you have to sit

00:24.057 --> 00:26.082
through before Pink Floyd comes out.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.593
Yeah, and-and it's not that
we don't like the comedian,

00:32.832 --> 00:37.963
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

00:39.739 --> 00:44.005
The problem is, though, after the concert's
over, no matter how great the show was,

00:44.244 --> 00:47.736
you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?

00:48.014 --> 00:52.883
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.789
Yeah, well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

00:58.024 --> 01:02.723
Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself
sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

01:07.434 --> 01:09.868
Are we still talking about sex?

01:11.204 --> 01:13.297
The One With the Sonogram at the End

02:01.421 --> 02:03.355
No, it's good, it is good,

02:03.556 --> 02:07.185
It's just... mm...that doesn't she seem
a little angry?

02:07.393 --> 02:08.724
Well, she has issues.

02:10.597 --> 02:11.655
Does she?

02:11.865 --> 02:14.390
She's trying to live with 'Mr hey I'm evolving"

02:15.668 --> 02:21.664
He's out banging other women over the head with a club,
while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!

02:22.142 --> 02:25.236
Marsha, these..these are cave people.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.441
Okay they have issues like...

02:28.915 --> 02:32.282
'Gee, that glacier's
getting kinda close.' See?

02:32.485 --> 02:35.818
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

02:36.022 --> 02:37.853
- No. No.
- Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

02:38.124 --> 02:42.220
Okay, okay, yes, it is.How about I'll, uh, catch up
with you in the Ice Age.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.157
- Can I stay?
- That would be no.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.506
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:08.288 --> 03:11.052
- Is this a bad time?
- No no, it's..

03:11.257 --> 03:13.487
the Stone Age.

03:15.695 --> 03:19.495
You look great. I hate that.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.801
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

03:24.003 --> 03:26.631
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who..

03:28.408 --> 03:29.739
stands erect..

03:33.079 --> 03:35.980
- So what's new? Still, uh...
- A lesbian?

03:06.120 --> 03:08.200
You look good too.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.200
Ah, well, in here,
anyone who...

03:48.861 --> 03:51.591
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.697
Ha! Looks like she didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.

04:02.909 --> 04:07.608
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company
where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.317
Then I've already seen this one!

04:14.420 --> 04:16.115
Are you through with that?

04:16.389 --> 04:19.085
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.257
Whose little ball of paper is this?!

04:22.495 --> 04:26.397
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a
note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need the note,

04:26.599 --> 04:29.625
so I balled it up and...
...now I wish I was dead.

04:31.170 --> 04:36.198
She's already fluffed that pillow...
Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that...but, it's fine!

04:36.676 --> 04:40.339
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give
them any more ammunition than they already have.

04:40.546 --> 04:44.676
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be
about the flatness of a child's pillow.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.752
Can you relax, you do this every time they come.
The place looks great.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.448
You got a beautiful lasagna here
that looks good enough to..

04:53.660 --> 04:55.321
to avoid touching.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.927
Monica? Hi!

05:01.868 --> 05:04.336
Um, Monica, you're scaring me.

05:05.672 --> 05:09.039
I mean, you're like, you're like all
chaotic and twirly you know?

05:09.509 --> 05:10.669
And not-not in a good way.

05:12.545 --> 05:18.381
Yeah, calm down.. You don't see Ross
getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

05:18.618 --> 05:22.349
That's because as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.420
You see, he's "The Prince."

05:24.657 --> 05:28.149
Apparently they had some
big ceremony before I was born.

05:29.764 --> 05:34.460
- Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! - What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.908
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

05:47.814 --> 05:51.045
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....

05:51.250 --> 05:53.047
No, look, don't touch that!

05:55.455 --> 05:59.858
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back to him...

06:00.059 --> 06:05.224
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl
in the veil that stomped on your heart.
in front of your entire family!"

06:05.431 --> 06:08.662
Oh God and now I'm gonna have to
return the ring, without the ring,

06:08.868 --> 06:11.803
which makes it so much harder...

06:12.605 --> 06:14.698
- It's easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
- Oh yeah!

06:15.775 --> 06:18.801
Okay look, it's gonna be okay.
You're gonna give it back to him..

06:19.011 --> 06:23.072
- it'll all be over and we'll eat alot of ice cream.
- Okay okay. It's a little pear-shaped diamond

06:23.282 --> 06:26.445
I tell you what-any diamond ring we find,
we'll run it by you.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.623
- Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
- Doy, probably right before she lost it.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.722
You don't get
a lot of "doy" these days.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.931
I know I had it this morning.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.263
and I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with..

06:45.571 --> 06:46.902
Dinah?

06:49.842 --> 06:53.300
- Ohhhh, don't be mad.
- You didn't.

06:53.513 --> 06:57.779
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I gave you one job!

06:59.118 --> 07:01.780
Oh, but look how straight
those noodles are.

07:02.588 --> 07:07.184
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you
look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

07:09.595 --> 07:11.062
I just..can't do it.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.993
Boys? We're going in.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.433
Hi.

07:27.346 --> 07:30.747
- Wow. That is not a happy hi.
- Carol's pregnant.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.417
Ooh! I found it!

07:34.687 --> 07:37.850
W... w... wh...
wha... w... w... w...

07:38.224 --> 07:39.452
Yeah.

07:40.493 --> 07:45.123
Do that for another two hours, you might
be where I am right about now.

07:46.098 --> 07:49.295
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in
perspective, huh, Mon?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.105
Well now, how...
how do you fit into this whole thing?

07:54.407 --> 07:57.035
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me
to be involved

07:57.243 --> 08:01.907
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

08:02.148 --> 08:06.482
- Basically it's totally up to me.
- She is so great. I miss her.

08:11.591 --> 08:15.925
- What does she mean by "involved"?
- I mean presumably, the biggest part of
your job is done.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.793
And the most enjoyable.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.634
Phoebe, say something.

08:23.870 --> 08:27.203
Anyway, they want me to go down
to this sonogram thing

08:27.406 --> 08:29.033
with them tomorrow.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.369
Yeah remember back when life was simpler..

08:31.577 --> 08:34.011
and she was just a lesbian?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.581
Ahh..those were the days.

08:38.084 --> 08:41.679
- So what are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.654
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.831
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?

09:03.743 --> 09:07.144
Oh, Martha Ludwin's
daughter is gonna call you.

09:09.949 --> 09:13.578
- Mmm! What's that curry taste?
- Curry.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.950
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.287
Do you remember the Ludwins?
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

09:24.497 --> 09:27.989
- They all had a thing for him.
- Oh, Mom.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.497
I'm sorry, why is this
girl going to call me?

09:30.703 --> 09:36.573
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, or food, or...I don't know

09:36.809 --> 09:39.209
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant...

09:39.412 --> 09:44.042
- No Mom, I don't have a restaurant,
I work in a restaurant.
- Well, they don't have to know that...

09:48.020 --> 09:51.615
- Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti, please?
- Yes.

09:51.824 --> 09:55.521
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's...easy.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.630
Actually we were going to have lasagna.

09:58.831 --> 10:01.766
- Oh I love lasagna.
- Well we're not having it.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.862
Then why you'd bring it up?
You know how he latches on.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.805
I know this is going to sound
unbelievably selfish on my part,

10:11.010 --> 10:14.776
but, were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

10:14.981 --> 10:17.506
Because I think it might take
some of the heat off me.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.317
What that Rachel did to her life...
We ran into her parents at the club,

10:24.523 --> 10:26.616
They were not playing very well.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.021
I'm not gonna tell you what
they spent on that wedding...

10:29.295 --> 10:31.786
but forty thousand dollars
is a lot of money!

10:34.734 --> 10:38.636
Well, at least she had the
chance to leave a man at the altar...

10:41.574 --> 10:44.543
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.902
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

10:48.114 --> 10:51.413
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!

10:51.717 --> 10:54.049
Even when you were a kid
and you were chubby,

10:54.253 --> 10:57.381
and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

10:58.891 --> 11:02.088
And you would read alone in your room,
and your puzzles...

11:05.765 --> 11:09.599
Look, there are people like Ross
who need to shoot for the stars,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.668
with his museum,
and his papers getting published.

11:12.905 --> 11:16.306
Other people are satisfied with
staying where they are...

11:16.509 --> 11:18.943
I'm telling you,
these are the people who never get cancer.

11:20.079 --> 11:23.139
They're happy with what
they have, they're basically content like..

11:23.349 --> 11:25.374
cows.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.652
Cows, Dad?

11:29.188 --> 11:31.952
She knows how much I love cows.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.556
And I read about these women
trying to have it all,

11:36.831 --> 11:41.823
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica'
doesn't seem to have that problem.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.999
- I'm telling you sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.
- Thank you, Daddy.

11:48.974 --> 11:52.205
Oh, so this does work.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.842
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

11:58.951 --> 12:03.820
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

12:07.293 --> 12:10.694
Look, I, uh... I realise you guys have been wondering

12:10.930 --> 12:13.990
what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.964
And so, well, here's the deal.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.437
Carol's a lesbian.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.939
She's living with a woman named Susan.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.542
She is pregnant with my child.

12:30.549 --> 12:33.541
And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.214
And you knew about this?!

12:47.366 --> 12:49.027
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

12:50.202 --> 12:52.796
Well, y'know, these people are pros.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.497
They know what they're doing,

12:56.709 --> 13:00.736
They take their time,
They get the job done.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.476
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents...

13:05.751 --> 13:08.879
Boy, if you could...
I'd want yours.

13:10.689 --> 13:11.678
Must pee.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.292
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.485
- You're a twin?
- Oh yeah we don't speak.

13:17.696 --> 13:20.688
She's like this high-powered,
driven career type.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.733
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.630
- Identical?
- Yeah people say we look alike.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.205
But I don't see it.

13:30.276 --> 13:33.336
All right, you guys,
I..I kinda gotta clean up now.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.447
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.982
Well no, although I did have
an imaginary friend who..

13:40.252 --> 13:42.049
my parents actually preferred.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.417
Hit the lights, please.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.396
How long was I in there?

13:56.468 --> 14:00.996
- I'm just cleaning up.
- Oh d'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

14:02.808 --> 14:04.332
Okay, sure. Thanks.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.073
Anyway.. um..

14:12.184 --> 14:15.347
So, you... uh...
you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

14:15.888 --> 14:17.253
Oh.. a little..

14:19.091 --> 14:20.422
Mm-hmm.. A lot.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.185
So, got any advice?

14:24.430 --> 14:27.627
Y'know, as someone who's
recently been... dumped?

14:28.767 --> 14:32.328
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'.

14:33.672 --> 14:37.870
Chances are he's gonna be this,
this broken shell of a man, y'know,

14:38.110 --> 14:43.412
so you should try not to look too terrific,
I know it'll be hard.

14:45.618 --> 14:49.952
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll
give Barry back his ring,

14:50.222 --> 14:54.818
and you can go with
Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

14:56.729 --> 14:59.220
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow...

15:00.065 --> 15:03.762
- When did it get so complicated?
- Got me.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.098
- Remember when we were in high school together?
- Yeah.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.866
I mean, didn't you think you were just
gonna meet somone,

15:10.075 --> 15:12.475
fall in love, and that'd be it?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.848
- Ross?
- Yes. Yes.

15:22.354 --> 15:26.256
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..

15:32.698 --> 15:34.188
Me neither.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.915
Hi. Sorry I'm late,
I got stuck at work.

15:53.119 --> 15:57.714
There was this big
dinosaur..thing. Anyway..

15:57.800 --> 15:59.379
Hi.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.924
- Ross, you remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

16:03.930 --> 16:07.892
- Ross.
- Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.767
So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

16:11.972 --> 16:15.304
- Dr. Oberman.
- ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he...

16:15.305 --> 16:17.475
- She.
- ...she, of course

16:18.178 --> 16:22.171
She... uh... familiar with our...
special situation?

16:22.449 --> 16:27.545
- Yes, and she's very supportive.
- Great okay, that's great.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.282
No, I'm..Oh.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.055
Thanks.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.940
Ross? That opens my cervix.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.711
- Barry?
- Come on in.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.581
- Are you sure?
- Yeah! It's fine, it's fine.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.987
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.393
So, how ya doin?

17:14.601 --> 17:15.590
I'm... uh...

17:16.903 --> 17:18.302
I'm okay.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.268
- You look great.
- Yeah, well.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.444
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.511
Be right there. Be back in a second.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.482
- I dumped him.
- Okay

17:53.840 --> 17:57.037
So, um... so how's this, uh,
how's this all gonna work?

17:57.243 --> 18:00.076
Well, the baby grows
in a special place inside the mummy's..

18:00.280 --> 18:01.338
Thank you.

18:01.548 --> 18:05.712
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

18:06.052 --> 18:09.021
Y'know, when..when important
decisions have to be made?

18:09.389 --> 18:12.688
- Give me a "for instance."
- Well, I..I don't know. Um okay okay..

18:12.892 --> 18:16.328
- How about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
- Marlon.
- Marlon?

18:16.529 --> 18:19.123
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.826
As in "Mouse"?

18:24.370 --> 18:25.701
As in my grandmother.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.701
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

18:31.711 --> 18:33.372
Um, how about, um...

18:33.913 --> 18:35.346
How about Julia?

18:36.182 --> 18:38.742
- Julia.
- We agreed on Minnie.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.614
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.517
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.226
I believe Julia's on the table?

18:50.196 --> 18:51.720
Sorry about that.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.327
So, what have you been up to?

18:57.537 --> 18:59.937
Oh, not much.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.098
- I... I got a job.
- Oh, that's great.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.968
Why are... why are you so tanned?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.916
Oh, I, uh... I went to Aruba.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.847
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon alone?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.212
No.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.420
I went with..uh

19:21.895 --> 19:23.624
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?!

19:23.830 --> 19:24.922
No.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.993
I went with Mindy.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.828
Mindy?

19:31.905 --> 19:33.566
My maid of honor, Mindy?

19:33.773 --> 19:36.708
- Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.978
You've got plugs!

19:43.183 --> 19:46.050
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.283
And you've got lenses!

19:49.088 --> 19:52.023
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye!

19:52.225 --> 19:53.692
Not for her.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.055
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.190
Okay...

20:03.002 --> 20:07.837
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.032
And I'm an orthodontist.

20:11.945 --> 20:15.472
You know, you were right?
I mean, I thought we were happy.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.546
We weren't happy.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.319
But with Mindy..

20:21.054 --> 20:22.885
now I'm happy.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.385
- Spit.
- What?

20:25.592 --> 20:27.059
Me.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.927
Anyway.. um,

20:32.198 --> 20:37.261
I guess this belongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.870
Like she'd settle for that.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.273
Yeah, that's true.

20:46.479 --> 20:50.176
But I think it's a nice ring..

20:50.383 --> 20:54.251
and thank you for giving it to me.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.420
Well, thank you for giving it back.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.158
Hello!?

21:04.831 --> 21:08.267
- Oh please, what's wrong with Helen?
- Helen Geller?

21:09.602 --> 21:13.094
- I don't think so.
- No it's not gonna be Helen Geller.

21:13.306 --> 21:16.537
- Thank you.
- No, I mean, it's not Geller.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.910
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

21:19.445 --> 21:24.576
No, actually, um,
we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.614
Well, wait a minute, wha...
Why is she in the title?

21:28.888 --> 21:30.253
It's my baby too.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.653
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember
you making any sperm.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.024
Yeah, and we all know
what a challenge that is!

21:39.799 --> 21:43.599
- All right, you two, stop it!
- No no no, she gets a credit, hey,
I'm in there too.

21:43.803 --> 21:49.537
Ross. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

21:49.776 --> 21:53.610
Of course not, I'm...
suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

21:53.813 --> 21:58.216
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing?
He knows no-one's gonna say all those names,

21:58.451 --> 22:00.976
so they'll wind up calling her
Geller, then he gets his way!

22:01.187 --> 22:03.348
My way?!
You... you think this is my way?

22:03.556 --> 22:07.151
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being, this is not my way...

22:07.427 --> 22:11.022
y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard.
I'm not, I can't do...

22:11.264 --> 22:13.960
Knock, knock. How are we today?
Any nausea?

22:14.167 --> 22:16.067
- A little.
- Just a little.

22:17.804 --> 22:22.673
Well, I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but... thanks for sharing.

22:22.909 --> 22:26.367
- Uh, lie back..
- You... uh... y'know what, I'm gonna go.

22:26.579 --> 22:30.948
I don't... I don't think I can be involved in this
particular thing right now.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.490
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.198
I know.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.770
Well, isn't that amazing?

23:02.281 --> 23:04.681
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

23:05.785 --> 23:10.415
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.661
You know, if you tilt your head to the left,
and relax your eyes..

23:16.863 --> 23:19.730
it kinda looks
like an old potato.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.834
- Then don't do that, all right?
- Okay!

23:24.737 --> 23:27.729
- Monica. Whaddya think?
- Mm-hmm.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.704
- Wh... are you welling up?
- No.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.211
- You are. You're welling up.
- Am not!

23:36.416 --> 23:38.976
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

23:40.486 --> 23:44.354
Hi, Mindy.
Hi, it... it's Rachel.

23:44.557 --> 23:48.323
Yeah, I'm fine.
I..I saw Barry today.

23:48.528 --> 23:53.192
Oh, yeah, yeah he... he told me. No, no, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.958
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

23:57.303 --> 24:00.932
Oh, oh, and Min, y'know, if...if
if everything works out..

24:01.140 --> 24:04.940
and you guys end up getting
married and having kids...and everything..

24:05.178 --> 24:08.306
I just hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose.

24:13.352 --> 24:17.379
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
