WEBVTT

00:03.236 --> 00:04.567
So, what is this?

00:04.704 --> 00:06.672
Googlie Worm.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.196
And this?

00:08.408 --> 00:10.569
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.641
It's so funny!

00:15.148 --> 00:16.581
What's this?

00:17.250 --> 00:19.718
A hunk of sandwich from last year.

00:20.887 --> 00:24.914
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!

00:25.825 --> 00:28.555
It's the classic struggle
between man

00:31.531 --> 00:33.897
Someone knocked over a lamp.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.936
You know what'll be great
about the fishing trip?

00:38.171 --> 00:41.834
When my Dad asks, "What are you
doing with your life?"...

00:42.075 --> 00:45.374
...I can say, "I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston.

00:45.578 --> 00:47.045
What about you?"

00:51.851 --> 00:54.581
Don't stop having fun
just because I'm here.

00:54.854 --> 00:57.288
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.217
Well, except you.

01:10.103 --> 01:14.199
You know what is so sweet? Those birds
have not left his side the whole time.

01:14.374 --> 01:17.070
Yeah, I wish that rooster were dead.

01:17.610 --> 01:22.240
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.
They broke up only two days ago.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.074
Go fishing next week.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.879
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.144
That's only phase one.

01:30.723 --> 01:33.487
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.486
Phase two?

01:35.695 --> 01:38.391
Getting drunk
and going to a strip club.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.493
How does going there
make him better?

01:42.735 --> 01:44.794
There are naked ladies there.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.168
Then to phase three:
seeing yourself with other women.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.909
There are naked ladies there too.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.642
Would you give me one minute, please?

01:57.484 --> 01:59.418
The One with Joey's Dirty Day

02:45.165 --> 02:48.657
These will match the jacket
you picked out last week?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.761
There we go.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.129
There it is.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.742
You know what I need?
Gloves.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.567
Brown leather dress gloves.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.644
Well, let's see....

03:01.848 --> 03:03.145
This one is large.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.417
And this one....

03:05.652 --> 03:07.449
Also large?

03:08.154 --> 03:10.349
Two larges coming right up.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.058
Hello.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.923
-Damn you.
-Could I have a moment?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.168
My niece, you see,
is in town from London.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.859
Shropshire, but you know.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.297
She's about your age, I'd say.

03:26.506 --> 03:30.374
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.010
Would you like to keep her
company tonight?

03:33.246 --> 03:34.804
Sure. You got it!

03:35.014 --> 03:37.505
Count me in. Me.
Fledermaus. Great!

03:38.251 --> 03:41.049
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.151
So?

03:52.198 --> 03:54.894
-Gloves?
-Sorry, I'll be right back.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.227
Actually, I got to take off.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.404
I was curious.
Do you have plans tonight?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.532
No, nothing!

04:02.775 --> 04:05.539
I invested in a nightclub.
It opens tonight. Want to come?

04:05.945 --> 04:07.606
That would be great!

04:08.114 --> 04:10.674
You're into hard-core S & M, right?

04:12.885 --> 04:15.445
-Well, I guess.
-I'm kidding.

04:17.523 --> 04:20.924
I'll put you on the VlP list.
Look for me.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.183
Great! You bet.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.022
I'll see you tonight.

04:25.565 --> 04:28.033
-I almost forgot the tickets.
-What?

04:28.301 --> 04:32.362
For you and Emily. Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.

04:33.873 --> 04:34.862
Oh, right.

04:35.074 --> 04:38.407
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.779
I can't believe
Kathy did this to me.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.113
I really thought she was the one.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.783
I'll tell you what.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.652
I'm not getting out
of this chair. Ever!

04:54.927 --> 04:57.623
From now on, this chair is the one!

04:58.064 --> 05:00.931
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.796
Just take the sweats off, okay?

05:05.004 --> 05:07.336
Take them off
and we'll have some fun.

05:11.878 --> 05:16.577
Wow, and I can't resist that line.
That's why I never wear sweatpants.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.819
Did you catch any fish?

05:22.021 --> 05:23.989
You guys have no idea.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.158
-You stink!
-Are you kidding?

05:27.060 --> 05:31.997
Three days without a shower.
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!

05:34.167 --> 05:35.259
How's he doing?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.992
He hasn't left
that chair in two days.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.262
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

05:46.112 --> 05:49.013
You see? He just needed
his pal to come home.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.250
I got to memorize my lines.

05:51.451 --> 05:55.217
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby!

06:00.460 --> 06:01.927
What's the matter?

06:03.363 --> 06:07.766
Joshua invited me to this
fancy club opening tonight.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.527
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

06:10.737 --> 06:15.299
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.372
So, what are you going to do?

06:19.045 --> 06:21.206
-I don't know.
-No! Help me!

06:21.781 --> 06:24.409
-I can't. I have to work.
-Phoebe?

06:24.617 --> 06:27.984
I would, but I get
my morning sickness in the evening.

06:28.421 --> 06:32.152
Unless she wants to spend the night
holding my hair back for me.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.387
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.

06:35.628 --> 06:38.256
It's my one chance for him
to see the "fun" Rachel.

06:38.464 --> 06:42.423
The "wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.263
Are Joey and Chandler back?

06:46.472 --> 06:50.772
Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.485
So....

07:06.159 --> 07:07.786
No.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.758
Come on!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.428
-She's here.
-Wait, wait.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.600
Ross, please?

07:14.801 --> 07:18.669
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

07:18.871 --> 07:22.830
...so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.940
That is a toughie.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.775
She's looking down the hall.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.343
She looked right at me.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.113
You can't see people
through that hole, can you?

07:40.626 --> 07:43.151
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.886
I thought we had moved on.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.998
I thought we could be happy
for each other.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.361
I mean, was that just me?

07:51.737 --> 07:52.897
All right, I'll do it.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.834
Thank you, thank you.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.303
Emily.
I'm Rachel Greene.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.040
Thank goodness!

08:01.581 --> 08:05.517
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight

08:05.718 --> 08:07.049
Really?

08:08.087 --> 08:12.251
I must've missed your call, though
I didn't leave the flat all day.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.582
Well, l

08:13.860 --> 08:16.522
That's not rude.
It's in keeping with the trip...

08:16.729 --> 08:20.392
...where I've been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

08:20.666 --> 08:23.328
...and been strip-searched
at the airport.

08:23.536 --> 08:28.530
Apparently, I look like someone who's
got cocaine stuffed up their bum.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.772
I think you look great.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.342
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you.

08:40.887 --> 08:42.286
I'll get her.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.784
Please, hurry.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.222
Don't you just love
the way they talk?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.196
-What?
-The baby kicked!

09:01.374 --> 09:02.739
Oh, my God.

09:02.942 --> 09:06.901
No, wait. The elastic
in my underwear busted.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.476
Oh, my God! I overslept!

09:10.716 --> 09:14.049
I was supposed to be
on the set half an hour ago!

09:14.253 --> 09:16.551
You can't go like that!
You stink!

09:16.756 --> 09:19.589
I fell asleep.
Now I don't have time!

09:19.792 --> 09:22.124
Just 10 blocks away.
If I run, I'll make it.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.829
Run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.293
Slow down!
No, keep moving.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.568
How did it go last night?

09:30.770 --> 09:33.671
Well, I didn't see Joshua.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.738
But I did punch a girl in the face.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.638
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring.

09:39.912 --> 09:44.747
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.
But there was a Rachel Greep.

09:44.951 --> 09:47.579
So did you get to meet her?

09:49.855 --> 09:53.450
There is no Rachel Greep.
But this girl overheard us.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.094
And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep!"
And he let her in.

09:57.296 --> 09:58.627
So you hit her?

09:58.864 --> 10:00.297
No, she was already in.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.434
This big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

10:03.636 --> 10:05.501
...so I clocked her.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.297
All I wanted was a few hours...

10:09.542 --> 10:12.443
...outside of work to see Joshua...

10:12.712 --> 10:16.341
...so he could go ahead and
start falling in love with me.

10:19.151 --> 10:20.709
Pheebs.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.485
Honey, that's your name.

10:25.858 --> 10:29.954
That's short for Phoebe? I thought
that's what we called each other.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.194
-You're wearing pants!
-That's right.

10:35.401 --> 10:39.337
Where are the guys? I'm ready
to get drunk and see strippers.

10:39.739 --> 10:40.831
It's 9:30 a.m.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.031
They got a breakfast buffet.

10:47.546 --> 10:48.535
Let me talk to him!

10:48.681 --> 10:50.342
-Oh, my God!
-Can't I just?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.514
-It's my phone and she's shush
-Please!

10:53.719 --> 10:55.084
What's he saying?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.850
He's with Emily in Vermont.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.886
What? Oh, my God!

11:00.092 --> 11:03.687
Who the hell is Emily?
No.

11:03.963 --> 11:07.330
When we first met her,
she was soaking, her feet were wet....

11:07.466 --> 11:09.093
Who wouldn't be miserable?

11:09.235 --> 11:11.703
I'm telling you, once l
got her into a dry pair of shoes...

11:11.837 --> 11:13.464
...she was a totally different person.

11:13.639 --> 11:16.574
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.505
How'd he end up in Vermont
with that witch?

11:21.147 --> 11:23.843
Maybe she doesn't hit him
all the time.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.978
There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

11:28.187 --> 11:32.089
I got to go! There's a deer
eating fruit from the orchard!

11:34.660 --> 11:38.391
He had to go. There was a deer
eating fruit from the orchard.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.160
I don't get this.
She was horrible!

11:42.401 --> 11:44.426
I'm going to go stand over there.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.762
Why do you care?

11:48.374 --> 11:50.433
I don't care.

11:51.577 --> 11:54.876
I'm just upset that
I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

11:55.181 --> 11:59.174
You do not just meet someone
and go flitting off to Vermont!

11:59.385 --> 12:02.411
When you first met Barry,
you flitted off to Vail.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.250
Could you, just for once...

12:05.458 --> 12:08.427
...not remember every little thing?

12:10.596 --> 12:13.064
So you know, when's he getting back?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.221
A couple of days.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.125
I knew something
like this would happen.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.859
What are you doing?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.669
You can't go back a phase!

12:23.008 --> 12:26.273
You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.748
Why don't you do your phase two
strip club thing with us?

12:33.018 --> 12:34.110
We can be guys!

12:34.887 --> 12:36.184
No, you can't.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.051
Let us be guys!
Maybe we want to be guys.

12:40.359 --> 12:44.853
No, you don't. You'd be all
hairy and wouldn't live as long.

12:45.364 --> 12:49.630
Would you just stop being
such a wuss and get those off?

12:49.902 --> 12:52.769
And come with us
and watch naked girls dance!

12:54.540 --> 12:56.371
Okay.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.238
I'm sorry.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.080
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm here.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.254
Calm down, we got time.
We're running late.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.455
All set.

13:16.929 --> 13:20.092
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating licorice.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.801
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with

13:28.474 --> 13:31.739
What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

13:32.011 --> 13:33.171
You.

13:34.180 --> 13:38.913
I could see why you would think that.
But you know who it is?

13:39.118 --> 13:40.107
You?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.914
No, no. It's Heston.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.580
What?

13:46.725 --> 13:50.991
He reeks like he went on a three-day
fishing trip, then ate licorice.

13:51.864 --> 13:56.198
No way. He's the only one
with a shower in his dressing room.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.198
Really? A shower?

13:58.437 --> 14:00.337
Which room might that be?

14:01.207 --> 14:03.539
The one with "Heston" on it.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.809
Interesting.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.458
I got some ones.
You want to put them in her panties?

14:23.629 --> 14:25.859
No, thanks, Mom!

14:29.535 --> 14:30.524
That.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.799
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.873
Maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.804
It's not my baby.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.314
Very good.

14:46.919 --> 14:51.083
Really good. I enjoyed it.
Very exotic.

14:51.957 --> 14:55.085
I just checked our messages
and Joshua didn't call.

14:55.461 --> 14:58.658
You'd think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.759
You know what makes it worse?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.594
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.497
Come on, look where you are!

15:08.173 --> 15:09.902
Another round of daiquiris.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.003
Virgin for me.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.509
Don't let me leave without
the name of that carpet guy.

15:19.451 --> 15:20.850
Come on!

15:22.388 --> 15:24.788
You know what?
I'll go home and call Kathy.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.955
If it'll help.

15:27.192 --> 15:30.093
That was a test.
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.728
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.762
Then I'll be so drunk,
I'll want to call Janice.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.629
You should! How is she?

15:39.471 --> 15:42.838
I think somebody needs
another lap dance.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.255
Who's in there?

16:07.666 --> 16:08.894
How you doing?

16:09.902 --> 16:11.893
Who in the hell are you?

16:12.338 --> 16:15.603
Would you believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas?

16:17.109 --> 16:20.545
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.776
No, wait. You don't understand.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.608
I'm an actor.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.855
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.079
And I stink!

16:33.392 --> 16:35.292
You're in this picture?

16:35.527 --> 16:39.122
I'm a cop who won't work with you
because you're a loose cannon.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.059
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.359
But I stink.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.031
Joey, right?

16:50.042 --> 16:52.977
Every actor, one time or another

16:56.115 --> 16:57.912
Every actor thinks he stinks.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.609
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.288
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.479
You don't understand.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.282
Listen to me.

17:08.994 --> 17:11.656
I don't know one actor
worth his salt...

17:11.897 --> 17:15.663
...who, one time in his career,
didn't say, "God, I stink!"

17:15.934 --> 17:20.371
I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.075
The important thing,
and you must remember...

17:26.278 --> 17:29.247
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...

17:29.448 --> 17:34.579
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower!

17:35.421 --> 17:37.082
Do you understand me?

17:37.289 --> 17:40.417
-Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
-Wait a minute!

17:40.626 --> 17:42.526
Take your pants.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.029
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.299
What a business.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.904
We did okay
at the strip club, right?

17:57.142 --> 18:00.737
Great. Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress is quitting...

18:00.979 --> 18:03.004
...to teach the third grade!

18:03.916 --> 18:06.817
-He still hasn't called.
-Who, Josh?

18:07.119 --> 18:08.143
It's Joshua.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.922
-He doesn't like "Josh"?
-No, I don't.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.959
I'm going to put my sweats back on.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.752
You know what?
You were right.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.964
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?

18:20.199 --> 18:22.326
Because we're girls.

18:23.869 --> 18:27.032
-You know what girls are good at?
-Stripping!

18:29.308 --> 18:30.536
No, listening!

18:30.742 --> 18:32.141
Sit.

18:32.478 --> 18:37.177
Maybe it would really, really help
if you would just talk.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.351
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

18:43.222 --> 18:46.680
And you know, if you want to cry,
that's okay too.

18:47.759 --> 18:50.489
I'm going to have
to ask you all to leave.

18:52.231 --> 18:56.531
Forget it. We tried,
but phase three is a lost cause.

18:56.735 --> 19:01.331
Those strippers were hot, and l
couldn't picture myself with them.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.438
They really were pretty,
weren't they?

19:07.679 --> 19:10.113
-I liked that fighter pilot one.
-Candy?

19:10.349 --> 19:12.544
She was so spunky!

19:14.153 --> 19:16.951
I think if I were going
to be with a woman...

19:19.691 --> 19:22.182
...it'd be with someone
like Michelle.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.452
She was just so petite.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.295
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.468
She had the smoothest skin.

19:33.705 --> 19:37.471
I stuck that dollar in
her G-string and grazed her thigh

19:37.709 --> 19:41.543
Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!

19:43.081 --> 19:46.141
I am totally picturing you
with all those women!

19:47.219 --> 19:48.584
That's not phase three.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.982
Well, I'm there too!

19:52.491 --> 19:54.254
Are we all together in a group?

19:54.459 --> 19:56.586
Stop it, you're killing me!

19:56.895 --> 19:58.658
I think I moved on to phase four!

19:58.997 --> 20:02.831
-What is that?
-I don't want a relationship ever!

20:03.101 --> 20:06.161
I just want sex
with strippers and my friends!

20:09.141 --> 20:10.438
Come on.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.701
Let me see that smile.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.003
I don't want to.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.540
Please?

20:16.682 --> 20:18.912
I wanted to go to the strip club!

20:19.851 --> 20:21.512
You'll have plenty of chances.

20:21.787 --> 20:26.417
There are thousands of women out there,
just waiting to screw me over.

20:27.092 --> 20:28.684
Yeah, all right.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.324
How was Vermont?

20:33.532 --> 20:35.500
Emily is...

20:36.001 --> 20:39.732
...incredible. There are
no words to describe her.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.203
The whole weekend was like a dream.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.835
And you! Rach!

20:47.879 --> 20:49.369
You were so right.

20:49.615 --> 20:50.604
What?

20:50.816 --> 20:54.115
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

20:54.353 --> 20:57.550
...where we could really
be happy for each other.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.656
I admit, I wasn't quite there.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.829
The thought of you
and that Josh guy

21:05.063 --> 21:07.054
Joshua.

21:07.332 --> 21:11.200
Joshua guy at that club,
dancing, having a good time.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.098
And the thought of it kind of....

21:14.306 --> 21:16.297
You know? But now!

21:16.508 --> 21:19.341
But now, I'm totally there.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.705
I'm finally where you are.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.882
Thank goodness!

21:25.183 --> 21:26.844
And thank you for Emily.

21:27.519 --> 21:30.852
No problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.716
I'm happy for you.

21:32.991 --> 21:34.982
Happy for you.

21:35.193 --> 21:37.161
Oh, no, happy for you.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.964
All right. Here's what we'll do.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.432
You are going to take off
my clothes.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.929
You two, go get the oils.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.302
And you, just constantly scream...

21:51.543 --> 21:53.943
..."Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

21:54.646 --> 21:56.637
I want to be with her.
I like her.

21:56.915 --> 21:59.884
That's fine.
Go with your instincts!

22:00.085 --> 22:01.450
What am I doing again?

22:01.653 --> 22:04.417
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.090
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.121
That's not Joshua.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.926
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.229
I'm sorry you can't stay.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.766
The rest of us
have a lot of work to do.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.965
What are you doing?

22:24.976 --> 22:27.103
All right, listen.
I got to wake up.
