WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:07.329
So how was Joan?

00:07.674 --> 00:08.504
Broke up with her.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.107
Oh, why?

00:10.310 --> 00:13.040
Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?

00:14.214 --> 00:16.011
They were huge!

00:16.850 --> 00:19.216
When she sneezed,
bats flew out of them.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.018
They were not that huge.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.554
I'm telling you, she leaned back,
I could see her brain.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.923
How many women will you reject...

00:29.163 --> 00:31.427
...over superficial,
insignificant things

00:31.732 --> 00:34.394
Hold it. I gotta side
with Chandler on this one.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.193
When I first moved here,
I went out with this girl.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.872
Really hot. Great kisser...

00:40.174 --> 00:43.234
...but she had the biggest
Adam's apple.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.438
Drove me nuts.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.675
-You or me?
-I got it.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.512
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.392
You guys are messing with me, right?

01:04.265 --> 01:06.199
Yeah. We are!

01:07.268 --> 01:10.931
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

01:12.139 --> 01:14.232
The One Where Heckles Dies

01:58.787 --> 02:03.053
You name one woman that you broke up
with for an actual real reason.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.223
Maureen Rasillo.

02:05.460 --> 02:09.123
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a real reason.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.159
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.396
You're doing it again.

02:18.006 --> 02:19.098
We're not doing anything.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.240
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

02:24.112 --> 02:26.672
You don't have birds.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.113
I could have birds.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.984
We'll try to keep it down.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.515
Thank you.

02:33.755 --> 02:36.246
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

02:37.125 --> 02:38.956
All right, bye-bye.

02:40.495 --> 02:41.484
Okay, Janice.

02:41.763 --> 02:44.630
Give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.

02:44.833 --> 02:45.993
We'll give you Janice.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.998
I miss Janice, though.

02:48.303 --> 02:50.328
Hello, Chandler Bing!

02:52.640 --> 02:56.235
Oh, my God!

02:56.544 --> 02:58.068
Oh, Chandler!

02:58.379 --> 03:00.404
Now! Now!

03:03.151 --> 03:03.981
That's it.

03:04.853 --> 03:07.321
There! Faster!

03:14.462 --> 03:18.125
Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!

03:28.176 --> 03:29.336
We won.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.034
We did it!

03:34.449 --> 03:35.848
Mr. Heckles!

03:40.154 --> 03:42.554
-How did this happen?
-He was sweeping.

03:42.824 --> 03:45.019
They found a broom in his hand.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.823
-That's terrible.
-I know.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.232
I was sweeping yesterday.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.229
It could've been me.

03:56.137 --> 03:57.968
Sweeping. You never know.

03:58.206 --> 03:59.366
Never know.

04:03.845 --> 04:07.804
It's very faint, but I can
still sense him in the building.

04:08.550 --> 04:11.314
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

04:14.756 --> 04:16.155
Okay, Phoebe.

04:16.925 --> 04:19.052
I'm sorry,
but sometimes they need help.

04:21.496 --> 04:22.394
Here we go.

04:22.597 --> 04:25.065
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.767
There are a lot of things
I don't believe in...

04:28.036 --> 04:30.095
... but that doesn't mean
they're not true.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.565
Such as?

04:31.906 --> 04:36.400
Like crop circles or
the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.578
What, you don't believe in evolution?

04:42.884 --> 04:44.078
Not really.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.245
You don't believe in evolution?

04:48.723 --> 04:50.850
I don't know.
It's just, you know....

04:51.092 --> 04:55.859
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.

04:59.267 --> 05:02.031
"Too easy"? Too

05:02.270 --> 05:05.706
The process of every living thing
on this planet evolving...

05:05.907 --> 05:10.241
...over millions of years from
single-celled organisms is "too easy"?

05:11.045 --> 05:13.036
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

05:13.948 --> 05:18.146
Excuse me. Evolution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

05:18.419 --> 05:22.219
Evolution is scientific fact,
like the air we breathe...

05:22.457 --> 05:23.981
...Iike gravity.

05:24.225 --> 05:26.489
Don't get me started on gravity.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.494
You don't believe in gravity?

05:34.902 --> 05:38.929
Well, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't believe in it.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.073
Lately I get the feeling that...

05:41.275 --> 05:44.472
...I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.

05:44.746 --> 05:45.804
Pushed.

05:48.149 --> 05:50.481
It's lsaac Newton and he's pissed.

05:56.388 --> 05:59.619
There she is. And over there,
that's the other one.

05:59.825 --> 06:02.020
This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,
Heckles' attorney.

06:02.294 --> 06:03.318
He'd like to talk to you.

06:03.795 --> 06:04.989
What can we do for you?

06:05.197 --> 06:07.290
All right, kids, here's the deal.

06:07.499 --> 06:09.524
According my client's will...

06:09.735 --> 06:14.297
... he wants to leave
all his earthly possessions...

06:14.539 --> 06:18.305
...to "the noisy girls
in the apartment above mine."

06:19.811 --> 06:20.971
What about his family?

06:21.213 --> 06:22.680
He didn't have any.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.879
Okay, so let's talk money.

06:28.687 --> 06:30.018
All right, there was none.

06:30.255 --> 06:31.882
Now, let's talk signing.

06:32.157 --> 06:35.320
You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.

06:36.928 --> 06:40.022
I can't believe that this whole time
we thought he hated us.

06:40.332 --> 06:43.768
Isn't it amazing how much
you can touch someone's life...

06:44.035 --> 06:46.003
...without even knowing it?

06:46.238 --> 06:47.728
Would you look at this dump?

06:47.939 --> 06:50.237
He hated us!
This was his final revenge!

06:50.509 --> 06:52.739
I've never seen so much crap!

06:53.044 --> 06:56.571
Actually, I think this apartment
sullies the good name of crap.

06:57.582 --> 06:59.209
Check this out.

07:01.186 --> 07:02.710
Can I have this?

07:04.122 --> 07:06.886
How can you not believe in evolution?

07:07.893 --> 07:10.862
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!

07:11.696 --> 07:14.529
Pheebs, I've studied evolution
my entire adult life.

07:14.766 --> 07:18.099
And we've collected fossils
from all over the world...

07:18.403 --> 07:21.804
...that actually show the evolution
of different species.

07:22.073 --> 07:24.803
I mean, you can literally see them...

07:25.043 --> 07:28.604
...evolving through time.

07:29.714 --> 07:31.739
Really? You can actually see it?

07:31.983 --> 07:36.579
You bet! In the U.S.,
China, Africa, all over!

07:37.322 --> 07:39.222
See, I didn't know that.

07:39.825 --> 07:41.918
Well, there you go.

07:43.728 --> 07:48.631
So now the real question is,
who put those fossils there and why?

07:52.637 --> 07:56.095
Look at this!
My Big Book of Grievances.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.267
Hey, there's me!

08:01.079 --> 08:03.843
"April 1 7th, excessive noise...

08:04.082 --> 08:06.983
... Italian guy comes home with a date."

08:07.819 --> 08:09.116
You're in here too.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.987
"April 1 8th, excessive noise...

08:12.257 --> 08:15.920
... Italian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cleaning."

08:22.868 --> 08:24.665
Well, that's excellent.

08:25.971 --> 08:27.336
Look at this lamp.

08:27.539 --> 08:29.973
Is this tacky or what?
We have to have this.

08:31.176 --> 08:33.337
I think we have enough regular lamps.

08:33.612 --> 08:35.705
What? Come on, it's not like...

08:35.947 --> 08:38.643
... I'm asking for this
girlie clock or anything.

08:38.884 --> 08:41.785
Which, by the way,
I also think is really cool.

08:42.654 --> 08:45.020
Look, it doesn't go
with any of my stuff.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.953
Well, what about my stuff?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.225
You don't have any stuff.

08:53.230 --> 08:55.994
You still think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

08:58.034 --> 08:59.092
Yes, you do.

08:59.369 --> 09:02.668
You think of it as your apartment
and I just rent a room.

09:05.575 --> 09:09.602
While you "mmm" on that,
I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

09:12.949 --> 09:16.544
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making
these little toys move?

09:19.756 --> 09:20.780
Opposable thumbs!

09:22.792 --> 09:27.252
Without evolution, how do you
explain opposable thumbs?

09:28.198 --> 09:32.134
Maybe the Overlords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

09:33.470 --> 09:34.528
Tell me you're joking.

09:35.071 --> 09:38.973
Look, can't we say that you believe
in something and I don't?

09:39.242 --> 09:41.938
-No, Pheebs, we can't.

09:54.712 --> 09:56.113
No, what's that all about?

09:56.849 --> 09:59.511
What is this obsessive need
to make everybody agree with you?

09:59.919 --> 10:04.982
I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

10:10.028 --> 10:12.087
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

10:14.700 --> 10:17.362
Check it out.
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

10:19.204 --> 10:20.501
He looks so normal!

10:20.739 --> 10:22.730
He's even kind of cute.

10:22.941 --> 10:25.239
"Heckles, you crack me up
in science class.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.501
You're the funniest kid in school."

10:27.746 --> 10:30.044
-Funniest? Heckles?
-That's what it says.

10:31.283 --> 10:34.548
Heckles was voted class clown,
and so was l.

10:36.454 --> 10:38.718
He was right!
Would you listen to that?

10:38.924 --> 10:41.256
I'd call that excessive.

10:42.193 --> 10:43.023
What?

10:43.295 --> 10:46.196
Heckles played clarinet in band,
and I played clarinet.

10:46.865 --> 10:49.959
He was in the scale
modeler's club and I was

10:50.201 --> 10:53.295
There was no club,
but I sure thought they were cool.

10:53.705 --> 10:56.037
So? You were both dorks.

10:56.708 --> 10:57.470
Big deal.

10:57.976 --> 11:00.968
I just think it's weird, you know?
Heckles and me

11:01.479 --> 11:03.242
Heckles and me. Me

11:03.715 --> 11:04.773
Me and Heckles.

11:05.283 --> 11:07.478
Hey, would you knock it off!

11:27.670 --> 11:28.898
Have you been here all night?

11:29.639 --> 11:30.936
Look at this.

11:31.574 --> 11:33.474
Pictures of all the women
Heckles went out with.

11:33.676 --> 11:37.407
Look what he wrote on them.
"Vivian, too tall."

11:37.647 --> 11:39.274
"Madge, big gums."

11:40.516 --> 11:41.505
"Too loud."

11:41.818 --> 11:43.911
"Too smart."
"Makes noise when she eats."

11:44.120 --> 11:45.747
This is me.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.853
This is what I do.

11:49.525 --> 11:51.959
I'm gonna end up alone,
just like he did.

11:52.195 --> 11:53.822
Heckles was a nut case.

11:54.097 --> 11:55.997
Our trains are on the same track.

11:56.265 --> 11:59.701
I'm coming up 30 years behind him,
but the stops are all the same.

12:00.003 --> 12:01.595
Bitter Town...

12:02.005 --> 12:04.599
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

12:06.175 --> 12:08.507
You know what we gotta do?
Get you out of here.

12:08.778 --> 12:10.439
I'll buy you breakfast.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.513
What if I never find somebody?
Or worse, what if I found her...

12:13.783 --> 12:17.651
... but I dumped her because
she pronounces it, "supposably"?

12:18.354 --> 12:21.346
Chandler, come on,
you're gonna find somebody.

12:21.624 --> 12:23.489
How do you know that? How?

12:23.693 --> 12:26.389
I don't know. I'm just
trying to help you out.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.362
You guys will all get married...

12:29.632 --> 12:31.031
...and I'll end up alone.

12:31.868 --> 12:33.495
Will you promise me something?

12:33.736 --> 12:37.035
When you're married, will you
invite me over for holidays?

12:37.540 --> 12:39.201
I don't know what we'll be doing.

12:42.211 --> 12:45.408
I mean, what if we're over
at her folks' place?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.742
Yeah, I understand.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.389
You can come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

12:55.591 --> 12:57.525
Every year, all right?

12:58.761 --> 13:02.094
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up like this.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.196
I'll see you, man.

13:13.776 --> 13:15.209
"Supposably."

13:17.947 --> 13:19.380
Supposably!

13:22.018 --> 13:24.248
Did they go to the zoo?

13:24.454 --> 13:26.684
Supposably.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.567
Hi. It's me.

13:43.306 --> 13:46.104
Oh, my God!

13:47.410 --> 13:49.605
Janice? You called Janice?

13:51.314 --> 13:52.440
Yes. Janice.

13:52.715 --> 13:54.615
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

13:54.884 --> 13:57.079
You remember Janice, right?

13:58.254 --> 14:02.782
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestly cared about me.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.721
Janice is my last chance
to have somebody.

14:12.802 --> 14:14.827
Oh, my God!

14:17.006 --> 14:18.633
Jeez, look how fat she got.

14:20.676 --> 14:24.339
-Hey, it's everybody!
-Hi, Janice.

14:24.647 --> 14:25.773
Janice, you're....

14:26.015 --> 14:28.006
Yes, I am.

14:28.818 --> 14:30.683
-ls it?
-ls it yours?

14:30.920 --> 14:32.945
You wish, Chandler Bing!

14:33.656 --> 14:37.592
You are looking at a married lady now.

14:42.265 --> 14:44.096
Congratulations.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.528
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

14:49.836 --> 14:51.701
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

14:51.971 --> 14:54.940
And what? Miss the expression
on your face? Oh, no!

14:55.141 --> 14:57.939
Janice likes to have her fun!

15:09.790 --> 15:11.849
You know what we haven't
played in a while?

15:12.859 --> 15:14.486
Hide the lamp.

15:16.463 --> 15:18.226
Monica, let it go.

15:19.566 --> 15:21.397
Did you know
I'm allergic to shellfish?

15:21.635 --> 15:24.695
Then you'll just have
to eat the other lamps.

15:27.841 --> 15:30.469
It's scary scientist man.

15:33.146 --> 15:34.875
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

15:35.082 --> 15:38.813
In this briefcase I carry
actual scientific facts.

15:39.052 --> 15:41.748
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

15:43.924 --> 15:48.987
Some of these fossils are
over 200 million years old.

15:49.262 --> 15:52.425
Before you even start,
I'm not denying evolution.

15:52.699 --> 15:54.758
It's just one of the possibilities.

15:55.001 --> 15:56.935
It's the only possibility.

15:57.204 --> 16:00.571
Ross, could you just open
your mind, like, this much?

16:02.375 --> 16:06.539
Didn't the brightest minds in
the world believe the Earth was flat?

16:07.447 --> 16:12.043
And up till 50 years ago, you thought
the atom was the smallest thing...

16:12.285 --> 16:16.016
...until you split it open
and this whole mess of crap came out.

16:18.358 --> 16:22.522
Are you telling me that you are
so unbelievably arrogant...

16:22.796 --> 16:26.596
...that you can't admit that
there's a teeny, tiny possibility...

16:26.800 --> 16:28.791
...that you could be wrong about this?

16:35.609 --> 16:37.543
There might be...

16:38.812 --> 16:40.643
...a teeny...

16:42.082 --> 16:43.140
...tiny...

16:44.818 --> 16:46.445
... possibility.

16:48.221 --> 16:50.416
I can't believe you caved.

16:53.326 --> 16:56.659
You just abandoned
your whole belief system!

16:58.064 --> 17:01.329
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but at least I respected you.

17:01.768 --> 17:02.996
But....

17:03.470 --> 17:05.665
How are you gonna go
into work tomorrow?

17:05.906 --> 17:08.636
How are you going to face
the other science guys?

17:08.842 --> 17:11.675
How are you going to face yourself?

17:28.261 --> 17:30.286
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

17:30.530 --> 17:31.428
I am.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.826
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

17:42.008 --> 17:42.838
What happened?

17:45.212 --> 17:46.645
It was an accident, I swear.

17:46.880 --> 17:50.816
I was putting on my jacket and
the thing and the lamp and it broke.

17:51.051 --> 17:54.452
Oh, please, Monica!
You've always hated my lamp!

17:54.688 --> 17:58.886
And now all of a sudden,
it's just magically, it's just broken?

17:59.159 --> 18:00.353
Phoebe, tell her?

18:00.627 --> 18:03.892
I didn't see it, because
I was putting on my jacket.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.461
But I want to believe you.

18:09.903 --> 18:13.839
Hey, Chandler. Monica just
broke my seashell lamp.

18:14.374 --> 18:15.534
Neat.

18:15.742 --> 18:17.642
I'm gonna die alone!

18:20.080 --> 18:20.910
Okay, you win.

18:23.016 --> 18:25.314
Chandler, you are not
gonna die alone.

18:25.919 --> 18:27.819
Janice was my safety net, okay?

18:28.054 --> 18:29.681
And now I have to get a snake.

18:32.058 --> 18:32.854
Why is that?

18:33.093 --> 18:36.494
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,
I'm gonna need a thing.

18:36.730 --> 18:38.357
You know, a hook.

18:38.565 --> 18:41.591
Like that guy on the subway
who eats his own face.

18:42.269 --> 18:44.328
So I figure I'll be
"Crazy Man With A Snake."

18:44.571 --> 18:45.833
Crazy Snake Man.

18:46.072 --> 18:48.063
Then I'll get more snakes,
call them my babies.

18:48.341 --> 18:50.434
Kids will run past my place!

18:50.744 --> 18:53.872
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"
they'll shout!

18:57.417 --> 18:59.908
You've got to get over this.

19:00.387 --> 19:01.752
You won't end up alone.

19:02.022 --> 19:03.546
Of course I will.

19:03.790 --> 19:07.556
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to actually go out with me...

19:07.761 --> 19:11.424
...and then I bitch that there
aren't any great women out there.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.397
You have just described...

19:15.602 --> 19:19.231
...virtually every man
that we've ever gone out with.

19:21.207 --> 19:23.300
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

19:24.978 --> 19:26.240
She's right.

19:53.446 --> 19:55.141
You're no different than the rest.

19:55.415 --> 19:57.576
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yes, he is.

19:57.784 --> 19:59.581
You are totally different.

19:59.819 --> 20:00.808
In a bad way?

20:01.087 --> 20:02.816
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

20:03.089 --> 20:04.818
You know what you want now.

20:05.058 --> 20:06.582
Most guys don't even have a clue.

20:06.826 --> 20:10.626
You're ready to take risks, be
vulnerable and intimate with someone.

20:10.897 --> 20:12.421
You're not gonna end up alone.

20:13.666 --> 20:18.797
You called Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone!

20:20.573 --> 20:22.473
-You've made it!
-You're there!

20:22.675 --> 20:25.109
You are ready to make a commitment!

20:25.345 --> 20:27.609
Don't know about that!

20:34.988 --> 20:36.080
What you got there?

20:36.289 --> 20:39.452
Something else that's not yours
that you can break?

20:42.362 --> 20:45.354
I know you like this
and I want you to have it.

20:45.598 --> 20:47.589
It'll look good in our apartment.

20:48.768 --> 20:50.599
Thank you.

20:56.676 --> 20:58.303
That's fine.

21:00.780 --> 21:04.341
You'll all be pleased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

21:05.118 --> 21:06.949
This woman Allison from work.
She is great.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.348
She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been...

21:10.623 --> 21:13.888
... holding off asking her out
in the past, because she has a...

21:14.994 --> 21:16.518
... unusually large head.

21:18.031 --> 21:21.194
But I'm not going to let
that stuff hang me up anymore.

21:21.801 --> 21:23.200
Look at me. I'm growing.

21:25.004 --> 21:27.666
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

21:28.508 --> 21:29.668
I'll take that.

21:29.909 --> 21:31.035
You want his yearbook?

21:32.045 --> 21:35.640
Some people said nice things about him.
Somebody should have it.

21:35.882 --> 21:38.316
Gosh, this is so weird.

21:38.651 --> 21:41.882
His whole life was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

21:43.156 --> 21:47.490
I think it would be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

21:48.594 --> 21:52.428
He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

21:59.272 --> 22:00.899
You're all going to hell.

22:01.174 --> 22:03.335
It's really not that big!

22:06.512 --> 22:08.776
-Taking that with you, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

22:15.721 --> 22:16.551
You coming?

22:17.190 --> 22:18.282
In a second.

22:34.474 --> 22:36.465
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

22:39.779 --> 22:41.940
We'll try to keep it down.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.717
My major was useless.

22:53.926 --> 22:58.022
How often do you look in the classifieds
and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

22:58.231 --> 22:59.721
Sure.

22:59.932 --> 23:02.162
My God, that's a big head!

23:04.070 --> 23:07.904
It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting.

23:08.107 --> 23:11.338
My head must look
like a golf ball at work.

23:12.445 --> 23:16.176
Don't get hung up on it. Quick!
List five things you like about her.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.416
Nice smile, good dresser.

23:18.618 --> 23:21.143
Big head, big head, big head!
