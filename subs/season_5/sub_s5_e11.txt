WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:03.758
Any entertainment there?

00:04.037 --> 00:08.565
All right. Here we go!
1999, the year of Joey.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.333
We're very happy for you.

00:10.577 --> 00:11.703
What's the matter?

00:11.911 --> 00:15.540
We wanted to kiss at midnight,
but nobody else will, so....

00:15.749 --> 00:18.411
All right, I'll take care of it.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.186
It's 30 seconds to midnight,
what are you gonna do?

00:21.321 --> 00:22.982
Will you just trust me?

00:23.123 --> 00:25.523
Thirty-three, 32, 31

00:25.792 --> 00:28.556
Who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?

00:29.562 --> 00:31.086
You can't kiss your sister.

00:31.431 --> 00:33.524
-Who's gonna kiss my sister?
-Chandler.

00:33.733 --> 00:34.722
Oh, man! Really?

00:34.968 --> 00:36.902
Would you rather
have me or him kiss her?

00:37.137 --> 00:38.399
That's a good point.

00:38.638 --> 00:42.096
Since I have that whole history
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.906
Phoebe! Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

00:47.113 --> 00:49.911
So obvious.
Why doesn't he just ask?

00:50.583 --> 00:53.074
-Rach! I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
-What?

00:53.286 --> 00:55.618
You can't kiss Ross.
You got the history.

00:55.822 --> 00:56.982
So?

00:57.223 --> 01:00.784
-Would you prefer me or Chandler?
-Good point.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.554
Three, two, one!

01:03.797 --> 01:05.128
Happy New Year!

01:11.638 --> 01:13.663
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.467
-Happy New Year.
-You too.

01:15.675 --> 01:16.903
Happy New Year, Joey.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.275
So that do anything for you?

01:23.850 --> 01:25.681
The One with
All the Resolutions

02:08.428 --> 02:09.486
You know what?

02:09.762 --> 02:13.858
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say "No divorces in '99!"

02:16.369 --> 02:18.360
But your divorce isn't final yet.

02:19.038 --> 02:21.131
Just the one divorce in '99!

02:23.443 --> 02:27.539
I am gonna be happy this year.
I am gonna make myself happy.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.873
Do you want us to leave the room?

02:30.783 --> 02:35.015
Every day I am gonna do one thing
I have never done before.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.381
That is my New Year's resolution.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.788
That's a good one!

02:40.026 --> 02:42.859
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.690
Now you only have to find
a planeload of people...

02:46.900 --> 02:50.063
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.

02:50.470 --> 02:54.372
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.

02:54.574 --> 02:58.340
Especially the ones who might
fly you to Europe for free.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.646
She has a better chance
of flying up your nose...

03:01.848 --> 03:04.316
...than you do of
not making fun of us.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.920
I'll bet $50 you can't go the year
without making fun of us.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.554
Better yet, a week.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.486
I'll take that bet, my friend.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.750
Paying me the $50 can be...

03:14.994 --> 03:17.519
...the "new thing you do" that day.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.223
And it starts right now!

03:22.835 --> 03:26.601
My New Year's resolution is
to learn how to play guitar.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.238
Really? How come?

03:28.441 --> 03:32.036
You know those special skills
I have listed on my resume?

03:32.245 --> 03:34.941
I would love it
if one of those was true.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.076
Want me to teach you?
I'm great.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.911
Really?
Who have you taught?

03:40.186 --> 03:42.677
Well, I taught me. And I loved me.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.856
That'd be great!
Yeah, thanks, Phoebe.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.728
My resolution is to be less obsessed
with being neat and clean.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.227
Really?

03:58.271 --> 04:00.262
Or something else.

04:01.941 --> 04:04.034
Look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.077
She'll need these to keep an eye
on that boyfriend.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.738
Who, from what I hear,
needs to keep his stapler...

04:10.950 --> 04:14.147
...in his desk drawer,
if you know what I mean!

04:15.054 --> 04:18.114
Maybe your resolution
should be to gossip less.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.258
What? I don't gossip.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.223
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.957
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.932
You know, kind of
like a public service.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.470
It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.
Is Ted Koppel a gossip?

04:35.675 --> 04:40.078
If Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.074
They were like this!

04:45.118 --> 04:49.578
Fine, my New Year's resolution
will be not to gossip.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.919
-It's easy.
-Easy? You have never kept a resolution.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.127
-Yes, I have.
-Okay, let's see how you did last year.

04:56.262 --> 04:59.356
No. No. Not my diary.
You cannot read my diary.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.466
"Dear diary: I'm so excited.

05:02.635 --> 05:07.265
My resolution is to write in you every day.
See you tomorrow."

05:07.407 --> 05:08.635
Nothing.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.571
You know, not a lot happened last year.

05:14.847 --> 05:19.375
All right, I will prove to you that I can keep it
this time. No more gossiping.

05:19.519 --> 05:23.580
I hate gossip. In junior high this girl
said a lot of mean stuff about me...

05:23.723 --> 05:25.520
...and I set her bike on fire.

05:25.658 --> 05:29.094
-Wow, what did she say about you?
-She said I was crazy.

05:29.228 --> 05:32.129
But I guess she got hers.

05:36.803 --> 05:40.364
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.334
I just asked that girl out.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.204
Nice!

05:46.479 --> 05:49.039
Is that part of
your "new thing" for today?

05:49.248 --> 05:51.182
Yes, it is. See?

05:51.484 --> 05:52.678
"Elizabeth...

05:53.653 --> 05:55.211
...Hornswoggle"?

05:56.756 --> 05:58.087
That's right.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.660
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.925
You okay, Chandler?

06:09.669 --> 06:11.694
Something funny about that name?

06:12.271 --> 06:15.434
No, I just think
I've heard it somewhere before.

06:18.411 --> 06:21.073
Oh, really? Where?

06:21.914 --> 06:24.382
Somewhere funny, I'll bet.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.313
Guess what.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.115
I have a date
with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.754
Oh, this must be killing you!

06:37.363 --> 06:39.194
All right, see you later.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.227
Not really.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.826
-I haven't told you her middle name yet.
-Well, don't. Just don't.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.701
-See you later.
-See you.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.071
All right, Phoebe,
I am ready for my first lesson.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.941
No, you don't touch the guitar.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.945
First you learn here, then here.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.754
Lesson one: Chords.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.753
Now, I don't know
the actual names of the chords.

07:08.861 --> 07:13.161
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.632
So then this is "Bear Claw."

07:19.672 --> 07:21.196
"Turkey Leg"...

07:22.508 --> 07:24.772
...and "Old Lady."

07:26.712 --> 07:29.977
What an interesting approach
to guitar instruction.

07:31.684 --> 07:36.178
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.

07:39.692 --> 07:40.681
Hey, everybody!

07:40.827 --> 07:43.694
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.456
I didn't.
Even when I found out

07:46.699 --> 07:49.725
Let's say I found out
something about someone...

07:49.969 --> 07:51.402
...and let's just say...

07:51.637 --> 07:53.298
...she's gonna keep it.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.708
Check this out.

08:02.715 --> 08:04.740
You nailed the Old Lady!

08:10.056 --> 08:15.153
I thought I was getting better,
so I stopped by this guitar store

08:15.394 --> 08:18.363
Did you touch
any of the guitars there?

08:19.365 --> 08:20.423
Did you?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.158
No.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.929
Give me your hands.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.840
Strings.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.502
Pick.

08:34.714 --> 08:38.411
-Do you want to learn to play guitar?
-Yes.

08:38.584 --> 08:39.846
Then don't touch one!

08:44.290 --> 08:46.724
-Hi, Ben.
-Auntie Monica!

08:48.227 --> 08:50.195
Ross is wearing leather pants!

08:54.634 --> 08:57.933
Does nobody else see
Ross is wearing leather pants?

08:58.638 --> 09:01.300
Someone comment on the pants!

09:02.909 --> 09:06.276
-I think they're very nice.
-I really like them a lot.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.874
Not what I had in mind.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.745
People like Ross don't wear
these types of pants.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.284
You see, they're very tight.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.414
Maybe there's something in that area?

09:19.959 --> 09:22.553
I think they look really good.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.421
Where'd you get them?

09:25.631 --> 09:27.758
I needed a new thing for today.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.492
There's this leather store
that always smells so good.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.104
And I thought to myself:
"Wow. I've never owned...

09:35.308 --> 09:39.642
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."

09:42.415 --> 09:44.280
Oh, come on!

09:48.254 --> 09:49.778
What do you think?

09:49.989 --> 09:51.149
You look like a freak.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.346
Awful!

09:56.128 --> 09:57.652
What are you doing?

09:57.863 --> 10:01.321
-It's my New Year's resolution.
-To blind my child?

10:02.101 --> 10:04.126
To take pictures of us together.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.067
It's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.673
Everyone will enjoy my music as well.

10:21.887 --> 10:25.789
My God, these pants!
I'm burning up.

10:27.693 --> 10:32.187
Oh God! She wants to snuggle now?
Is she trying to kill me?

10:32.398 --> 10:34.525
It's like a volcano in here!

10:36.168 --> 10:39.331
-Are you hot?
-No.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.996
It must just be me, then.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.084
That was just the pants
and the couch.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.987
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.390
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.139
My favorite part's coming up!

12:06.125 --> 12:07.717
Oh, my God!

12:11.497 --> 12:12.486
Tiger.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.655
Dragon.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.597
Iceberg!

12:15.935 --> 12:19.234
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?

12:19.505 --> 12:20.836
Yes, I did!

12:21.073 --> 12:22.267
Then do lceberg.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.665
G-sharp.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.275
G-sharp?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.643
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.240
Have you?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.077
Oh, my God!

12:36.322 --> 12:38.313
What? I didn't touch a guitar!

12:38.524 --> 12:40.253
But you're questioning my method!

12:40.459 --> 12:43.622
No, I'm not questioning it.
I'm saying it's stupid!

12:44.430 --> 12:45.419
What?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.027
Thank you.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.961
You know, none of my other student...

12:53.172 --> 12:54.867
...thought I was stupid.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.205
Your other student was you!

12:59.678 --> 13:03.671
Well, maybe you just need
to try a little harder!

13:03.883 --> 13:06.181
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!

13:06.385 --> 13:08.649
Here! Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.152
There's a picture of him with a kid.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.848
And the kid's got a guitar!

13:15.795 --> 13:16.784
Fine!

13:17.029 --> 13:19.691
You learn from
your "qualified instructor."

13:19.965 --> 13:22.525
But don't come crying
when everyone is sick...

13:22.735 --> 13:25.704
...of hearing you play
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!

13:29.475 --> 13:31.966
Oh, fine. Take his side!

13:38.417 --> 13:40.715
I can't wait to be with you.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.045
I'll sneak over as soon as I can.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.746
I'll tell Rachel
I'll be doing laundry.

13:46.025 --> 13:49.085
Laundry.
Is that my new nickname?

13:53.566 --> 13:56.330
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big

14:07.413 --> 14:12.146
Would you stop looking at me like that?
Phoebe was a terrible teacher.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.309
I wasn't learning anything from her

14:14.453 --> 14:17.945
Look I feel bad, too
Forget it, we're going around in circles.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.523
Joey, it's Ross.
I need some help.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.693
Chandler's not here.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.391
You can help me.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.739
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.567
Nice!

14:38.410 --> 14:41.868
No, I got really hot in my pants,
so I took them off.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.048
But they must have shrunk
from the sweat.

14:45.317 --> 14:48.548
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

14:48.821 --> 14:53.349
I can't get them back on, Joey.
I can't!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.759
That is quite a situation.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.390
Do you see any powder?

15:02.201 --> 15:04.396
Powder! Yeah, I have powder.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.069
Good, good.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.604
Sprinkle some on.
It'll absorb moisture.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.502
Then you can get your pants on.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.404
Yeah, hold on.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.368
They're not coming on, man.

15:39.038 --> 15:44.203
Okay, cut slits in the pants, right?
Then put them back on...

15:44.343 --> 15:48.074
...go out there
and tell her you're the lncredible Hulk.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.183
Chandler's not there?

15:52.885 --> 15:55.979
That would have worked,
but all right, fine.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.918
You see any....
Oh, Vaseline?

16:00.893 --> 16:03.862
I see lotion. I have lotion.
Will that work?

16:04.063 --> 16:06.361
Sure, throw some of that on there.

16:06.498 --> 16:07.487
Hold on.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.750
Sounds like it's working.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.581
They're still not coming on, man.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.284
And the lotion and the powder
have made a paste.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.389
Really.

16:41.567 --> 16:42.556
What color is it?

16:43.736 --> 16:46.364
What difference does that make?

16:46.605 --> 16:50.097
If the paste matches the pants,
you can make paste pants...

16:50.309 --> 16:51.867
...and she won't know!

16:54.046 --> 16:55.274
Do you have a minute?

16:55.481 --> 16:56.914
Dude, what am l

16:57.116 --> 17:00.142
Rachel's here, so good luck.
Let me know how it goes.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.155
Joey, I have such a problem.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.358
Your timing couldn't be better.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.255
I'm putting out fires
all over the place.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.965
I have got to tell you something.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.293
What is it?

17:16.502 --> 17:19.903
It's so huge! But promise me.
You cannot tell anyone.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.403
No, no, no!
I don't want to know.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.836
You do want to know.
This is unbelievable!

17:26.111 --> 17:29.444
I'm tired of being the guy
who knows all the secrets...

17:29.648 --> 17:31.138
...and can't tell anyone.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.816
You know secrets?

17:33.018 --> 17:34.645
You're not supposed to gossip!

17:34.853 --> 17:37.583
I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone

17:43.862 --> 17:45.693
I'm not listening to you!

18:02.881 --> 18:05.349
You've been in there for a long time.

18:05.617 --> 18:08.177
I'm starting to get
kind of freaked out.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.981
All right, I'm coming out.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.718
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

18:17.863 --> 18:20.559
Let's just leave the lights on.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.468
Oh, my God!

18:33.645 --> 18:35.545
I had a problem.

18:42.654 --> 18:47.023
I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.

18:52.197 --> 18:56.827
I want to apologize for saying
your method was stupid.

18:58.003 --> 19:01.530
And maybe ask you
to be my teacher again?

19:01.773 --> 19:05.504
I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.615
You really think I'm ready?

19:18.290 --> 19:20.258
Wow, cool!

19:40.579 --> 19:43.810
-Was the chord at least right before
-No.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.314
Oh, my God!

19:54.660 --> 19:57.561
We heard about your pants.
I'm so sorry.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.560
This year was supposed to be great.

20:01.466 --> 20:04.264
It's only the second day
and I'm a loser...

20:04.469 --> 20:07.563
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit!

20:08.640 --> 20:10.904
You're not a loser.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.340
Look at me!

20:19.785 --> 20:21.309
Hey, look!

20:22.621 --> 20:24.589
Ben drew a picture of you.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.917
You're a cowboy.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.697
Because of the leather pants?

20:35.601 --> 20:39.765
He thinks you're a cowboy,
not a loser. That's something.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.998
-lt really is something.
-Howdy, partner.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.144
Maybe I should get another pair.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.871
You know, they had some...

20:50.182 --> 20:53.276
...with fringe all down the sides.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.880
Phoebe, you may know this.
You know strange things.

20:58.023 --> 21:01.049
What is the boiling point of brain?

21:01.293 --> 21:03.488
I used to know this.

21:05.731 --> 21:08.063
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.304
I can't believe he thinks
I'm a cowboy.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.637
I would make a good cowboy.

21:23.415 --> 21:26.782
Now that everything's wrapped up,
I'll do my laundry.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.783
Yeah, me too.
If this shirt is dirty.

21:36.161 --> 21:38.322
I'm going to the airport.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.088
If I hang around there
long enough...

21:41.300 --> 21:44.565
...someone's bound to leave
a plane unattended.

21:45.837 --> 21:47.270
-Good luck, honey.
-Bye.

21:52.077 --> 21:55.069
Remember that thing
I was gonna tell you about?

21:59.184 --> 22:02.312
I won't tell you.
But if you found out on your own...

22:02.587 --> 22:05.420
...that would be okay
and we could talk about it.

22:05.657 --> 22:09.457
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So that would be okay.

22:13.432 --> 22:16.094
Would you mind going
into Chandler's bedroom...

22:16.335 --> 22:19.361
...and getting that book
he borrowed from me?

22:22.507 --> 22:24.941
Now? You want me
to go over there now?

22:27.479 --> 22:29.811
-Do you know something?
-Do you?

22:31.116 --> 22:33.607
-I might know something.
-I might too.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.718
-What do you know?
-You tell me first.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.445
-I can't.
-Then I can't.

22:38.657 --> 22:39.851
Okay, fine.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.724
You don't know.

22:50.902 --> 22:53.837
I'll walk into his bedroom
and see the thing...

22:54.005 --> 22:57.372
...I think I know is actually
the thing I think I know!

22:58.410 --> 22:59.968
-You know!
-And you know!

23:00.212 --> 23:01.236
Yeah, I know!

23:01.480 --> 23:04.381
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable!

23:04.649 --> 23:06.879
-How long have you known?
-Too long!

23:07.085 --> 23:10.179
I've been dying to talk
to someone about this!

23:10.389 --> 23:14.348
You can't say anything to anybody.
They're so weird about that.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.187
It's raining.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.730
I don't like to fly in the rain.

23:25.170 --> 23:28.196
I am gonna go for a walk
in the rain.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.566
Me too.

23:33.879 --> 23:35.278
That's weird.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.844
I bet they're doing it.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.653
Okay, look.
I can't take it anymore.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.883
So you win. Okay?
Here.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.824
Flying a jet?
Make it a spaceship...

23:52.030 --> 23:54.328
...so you can get back
to your home planet!

23:56.067 --> 23:59.525
Phone call for you. Tom Jones.
He wants his pants back!

24:00.906 --> 24:05.002
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating
a character from Fraggle Rock?
