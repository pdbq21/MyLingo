WEBVTT

00:03.611 --> 00:05.922
- So you and Rachel tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.450
Yeah, it's actually
our first official date.

00:08.616 --> 00:11.257
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?

00:11.418 --> 00:14.892
No. This is the part
I'm actually good at.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.623
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-loathing?

00:20.708 --> 00:22.347
It's okay.

00:23.350 --> 00:25.583
How can you be so confident?

00:25.753 --> 00:28.474
Well, I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

00:28.636 --> 00:32.713
- Really? Like, you have a routine?
- No. See, each woman is different.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.636
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.884
- Really?
- No, I do six things.

00:39.046 --> 00:43.009
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.

00:43.170 --> 00:47.965
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.889
You mean like this?

00:54.381 --> 00:57.775
No, not like that. No, no.
No, like this:

01:01.428 --> 01:03.547
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.

01:09.076 --> 01:11.513
- More foosball?
- And beer.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.157
The One With Ross's Tan

01:58.806 --> 02:00.764
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:00.928 --> 02:02.966
Hey, sweetie.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.576
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.

02:12.740 --> 02:16.578
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.

02:17.104 --> 02:20.099
I'm sorry, it's just...
How'd you get so tan?

02:20.267 --> 02:23.387
She went to one of those
spray-on tan places.

02:23.951 --> 02:26.262
You got a spray-on tan?

02:26.433 --> 02:28.745
Chandler gets pedicures!

02:29.076 --> 02:32.037
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.952
Why? Why?

02:36.003 --> 02:37.677
I can't believe that's sprayed on.

02:37.845 --> 02:40.885
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.

02:41.048 --> 02:45.250
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.

02:45.412 --> 02:49.489
So do you get colors
or just French tips?

02:52.940 --> 02:56.698
- Here. Here's their card.
- Thanks.

02:56.864 --> 02:59.096
Hey, I know where this place is.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.463
It used to be an X-rated video...

03:04.752 --> 03:06.027
Florist.

03:09.877 --> 03:12.519
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.638
You won't believe
who moved back to town.

03:14.802 --> 03:16.202
I know. Amanda.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.483
- She called me too. She's the worst.
- Who's Amanda?

03:19.647 --> 03:22.288
She's this girl who lived in the building
before you did.

03:22.449 --> 03:25.604
Then she moved to England and
picked up this fake British accent.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.925
On the machine, this is her message:

03:28.095 --> 03:32.058
"Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."

03:32.820 --> 03:35.701
Are you trying to do a British accent?

03:38.425 --> 03:39.906
Chandler gets pedicures.

03:42.349 --> 03:45.663
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?

03:46.193 --> 03:48.470
know what Amanda said
when she called me?

03:48.636 --> 03:51.152
"Oh, so sorry to catch you
on your mobile."

03:52.560 --> 03:57.001
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.

03:57.565 --> 04:00.799
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.

04:00.968 --> 04:02.368
Oh, I know!

04:02.530 --> 04:05.285
"I slept with Billy Joel."

04:06.013 --> 04:08.131
All right, who hasn't?

04:08.295 --> 04:10.892
What are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.

04:11.058 --> 04:12.652
Let's just cut her out.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.461
- What?
- Cut her out of our lives.

04:15.623 --> 04:19.016
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.

04:19.186 --> 04:23.024
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.

04:23.190 --> 04:26.789
- Have you ever done that?
- No. Had it done to me, though.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.108
Feels good.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.561
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.764
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.

04:41.929 --> 04:44.206
Well, I like how you look.
What are you?

04:44.371 --> 04:46.888
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.811
You'll face the red light.

04:50.978 --> 04:54.657
When the light's on, the spraying's
about to start, so close your eyes.

04:54.822 --> 04:57.258
When the spraying stops,
count to five...

04:57.424 --> 05:01.307
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?

05:01.468 --> 05:05.625
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.

05:05.793 --> 05:10.268
- You catch on quick.
- Well, I have a Ph.D., so...

05:31.619 --> 05:34.614
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three...

05:35.743 --> 05:40.663
Wait, wait!
I'm not... I'm not finished counting!

05:44.872 --> 05:47.104
You sprayed my front twice!

05:47.314 --> 05:50.468
- You never turned?
- No! I barely got to "three Mississippi"!

05:50.638 --> 05:54.031
Mississippi? I said count to five.

05:54.802 --> 05:56.441
Mississippi-less-ly?

05:58.005 --> 05:59.804
Well, how bad is it?

05:59.967 --> 06:03.167
Not that bad yet. But it gets
darker for the next four hours.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.849
- So how dark will it get?
- You got sprayed with two twos and...

06:07.014 --> 06:08.847
I'm a four?

06:09.577 --> 06:12.811
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.620
Really?

06:15.302 --> 06:17.899
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay!

06:26.594 --> 06:29.315
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.

06:29.476 --> 06:33.109
How do I know
when it's gonna start? Hello?

06:34.401 --> 06:36.200
My eyes!

06:48.776 --> 06:50.928
The same thing happened again!

06:51.098 --> 06:53.854
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight!

06:59.266 --> 07:00.542
Thanks for dinner.

07:01.949 --> 07:03.224
I thought you paid.

07:05.472 --> 07:08.228
Guess we won't be going back there.

07:09.076 --> 07:11.547
- So...
- Yeah.

07:21.609 --> 07:25.241
Hey, what do you say we move this
onto the likes of the couch?

07:25.412 --> 07:28.213
I say cheesy line, but okay.

07:47.474 --> 07:50.037
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

07:50.197 --> 07:52.998
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.836
Okay. Sorry.

08:06.774 --> 08:10.167
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.

08:10.337 --> 08:12.455
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.

08:16.383 --> 08:20.096
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.180
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:39.006 --> 08:40.440
Was that good for you?

08:44.371 --> 08:46.683
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.

08:46.854 --> 08:50.167
Yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.

08:52.219 --> 08:55.818
- It could be Amanda.
- Oh, you're right.

08:55.983 --> 09:00.857
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.383
Hello, Monica.
It's Amanda calling again.

09:04.552 --> 09:07.148
I'm in the neighborhood,
hoping I could pop by your flat.

09:07.314 --> 09:11.311
You're from Yonkers!
Your last name is Buffamonteezi!

09:11.919 --> 09:14.276
Let's see.
So should you get this directly...

09:14.441 --> 09:15.876
...ring me back on my mobile.

09:16.043 --> 09:18.081
Okay, don't hold thy breath.

09:20.928 --> 09:24.561
- Hello? Is someone on the line?
- Yes. I was looking for Monica.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.693
Hang on, she's right here.

09:29.857 --> 09:33.091
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.

09:34.902 --> 09:37.054
I get pedicures.

09:40.227 --> 09:42.026
Hi, Amanda.

09:44.191 --> 09:47.824
Actually, now is not a good time.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.631
Dinner tomorrow night?

09:50.838 --> 09:53.115
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.672
Why? Why?
Why didn't you just say no?

09:55.843 --> 09:59.395
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.958
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.

10:03.330 --> 10:07.247
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.

10:07.414 --> 10:09.726
- Oh, and you would?
- I did.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.056
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

10:16.223 --> 10:18.420
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.

10:18.586 --> 10:20.818
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.030
Okay, well, how can
we make it easier?

10:25.472 --> 10:28.035
Okay. Let's work from the top down.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.517
- Just work the bra, Joe.
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.

10:38.365 --> 10:40.677
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:54.061 --> 10:56.019
- Is this thing welded shut?
- Okay.

10:56.744 --> 11:00.262
All right, turn around.
I gotta get a look at this thing.

11:05.993 --> 11:07.951
Sorry.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.150
Well, this is romantic.

11:12.319 --> 11:14.916
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

11:15.082 --> 11:17.918
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.

11:18.085 --> 11:21.000
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...

11:21.168 --> 11:23.286
...and it popped open.

11:23.731 --> 11:27.728
- I blame your bra.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.

11:27.935 --> 11:31.898
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.

11:32.059 --> 11:36.022
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.

11:36.183 --> 11:42.378
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?

11:44.592 --> 11:46.824
No, I don't have another level.

11:58.365 --> 12:03.398
Hold on. There's something different.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.973
I went to that tanning place
your wife suggested.

12:09.136 --> 12:12.097
Was that place the sun?

12:13.661 --> 12:15.493
Oh, and it gets worse.

12:19.547 --> 12:23.669
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and Ivory" all by yourself.

12:25.232 --> 12:27.829
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.

12:27.995 --> 12:30.637
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.

12:30.798 --> 12:33.075
- How do you count to five?
- One, two, three...

12:33.240 --> 12:34.595
Damn it!

12:36.724 --> 12:38.238
I know!

12:41.128 --> 12:44.089
What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

12:45.292 --> 12:46.852
How was your date with Joey?

12:47.014 --> 12:51.409
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.

12:51.579 --> 12:55.097
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...

12:55.262 --> 12:56.856
...and I kept slapping it away.

12:57.024 --> 12:58.299
You didn't like that?

13:00.187 --> 13:02.909
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.744
He couldn't even undo my bra.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.186
Really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.

13:11.438 --> 13:13.671
I do not know what's wrong with us.

13:13.841 --> 13:16.073
We've kissed before
and that's been great.

13:16.443 --> 13:18.242
But this time
it was leading somewhere...

13:18.405 --> 13:21.765
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.

13:21.929 --> 13:23.762
You guys have been friends forever.

13:23.931 --> 13:26.367
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.

13:26.534 --> 13:29.494
You couldn't stop laughing.
You got through that.

13:29.657 --> 13:32.936
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.300
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

13:36.463 --> 13:38.582
Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:38.746 --> 13:42.219
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

13:49.276 --> 13:51.588
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.

13:51.759 --> 13:53.273
You don't know.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.719
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

13:58.886 --> 14:01.038
- Is Amanda here yet?
- No.

14:01.248 --> 14:05.006
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.

14:05.172 --> 14:08.167
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.330
Okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?

14:11.498 --> 14:15.051
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

14:15.583 --> 14:18.224
- Are you kidding? I love it!
- Okay.

14:19.466 --> 14:21.858
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:22.510 --> 14:24.388
Hello!

14:25.593 --> 14:27.586
It's so nice to see you.

14:27.755 --> 14:31.718
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look!

14:33.521 --> 14:36.083
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

14:36.243 --> 14:41.368
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.

14:41.529 --> 14:44.250
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

14:44.411 --> 14:48.534
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's...
- Oh, smell my neck.

14:48.776 --> 14:53.775
It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

14:55.743 --> 14:57.496
Musty.

14:58.345 --> 15:02.422
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.

15:02.590 --> 15:05.152
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.

15:05.713 --> 15:08.434
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was 1992.

15:08.596 --> 15:13.196
And I remember, because that was
the year I had sex with Evel Knievel.

15:14.562 --> 15:16.201
We were friends in 1992.

15:16.363 --> 15:19.403
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...

15:19.567 --> 15:21.639
...and trying to avoid seeing her.

15:22.730 --> 15:26.647
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.

15:26.814 --> 15:28.727
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, bugger.

15:28.896 --> 15:34.214
Should I not have said that?
I feel like a perfect arse.

15:35.943 --> 15:38.459
Well, in America, you're just an ass.

15:42.990 --> 15:44.584
Hello?

15:44.752 --> 15:46.585
Chandler, what's wrong?

15:46.874 --> 15:50.791
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.998
I'm so sorry,
but Chandler was in a car accident.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.676
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

15:55.843 --> 15:58.565
- Was Mike with him?
- Nope.

16:03.450 --> 16:05.842
- Got the champagne?
- Yes. Ready to power through.

16:06.013 --> 16:08.849
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...

16:09.016 --> 16:12.649
...and, in the interest
of powering through...

16:16.784 --> 16:19.984
Okay, sexy, sexy...

16:20.147 --> 16:24.349
...very sexy. Sexy.
All right, let's do it!

16:24.512 --> 16:26.630
Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.

16:26.794 --> 16:29.390
Get over it, soldier,
we gotta do this.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.112
- Okay. You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.402
You like that?
Let's kick this into high gear, huh?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.118
Yeah, baby!
I'll show you how we do it!

16:40.287 --> 16:41.563
No, no, no!

16:41.729 --> 16:43.402
You kneed me in my misters!

16:43.571 --> 16:48.171
What? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

16:48.536 --> 16:51.098
Joey? Are you okay?

16:55.503 --> 16:57.495
Soldier down.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.260
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.

17:03.751 --> 17:07.907
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.

17:08.876 --> 17:12.668
Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

17:12.840 --> 17:18.317
- I have nothing to say to you.
- My flat is twice this size.

17:18.485 --> 17:21.480
Please, Monica, in the hall?

17:23.651 --> 17:27.169
Oh, that accident
must have been terrible.

17:27.334 --> 17:30.569
You look positively ghastly.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.730
Well, aren't you a treat.

17:35.543 --> 17:38.856
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?

17:39.026 --> 17:41.223
It was right after we
were living together...

17:41.428 --> 17:43.182
...and you were driving me crazy,
okay?

17:43.350 --> 17:46.983
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

17:47.154 --> 17:49.990
Well, I'm still all those things!

17:50.357 --> 17:54.833
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.402
I am scrappy.

17:59.567 --> 18:03.849
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.

18:04.011 --> 18:05.526
Of all the people I've cut out...

18:05.693 --> 18:08.893
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.

18:10.978 --> 18:12.936
That's because I'm scrappy.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.379
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

18:16.544 --> 18:18.935
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.

18:19.426 --> 18:22.182
I don't know what
I would do without you.

18:26.794 --> 18:30.472
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.

18:30.638 --> 18:34.521
- We should do the same for Amanda.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.689
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.502
Let me explain how this works.
Go in the booth and...

18:55.663 --> 19:00.058
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Glenda. Okay?

19:00.227 --> 19:02.869
Does it look like this is
my first time?

19:03.030 --> 19:08.234
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.

19:08.956 --> 19:10.356
Okay.

19:22.890 --> 19:28.367
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
Which one is it? Which one is it?

19:30.097 --> 19:32.374
Oh, son of a bitch!

19:38.586 --> 19:41.341
What is the matter with us?

19:41.549 --> 19:44.270
Well, I know what's
the matter with me.

19:44.431 --> 19:48.714
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...

19:49.236 --> 19:50.796
...difficult?

19:52.520 --> 19:54.193
I don't know.

19:54.401 --> 19:58.638
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.126
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:00.287 --> 20:04.330
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...

20:04.491 --> 20:09.012
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?

20:09.857 --> 20:12.613
kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys...

20:12.780 --> 20:14.977
No, no, no. No, I mean...

20:15.142 --> 20:16.736
...sexually.

20:16.904 --> 20:21.664
Yeah, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...

20:21.829 --> 20:23.981
...really wrong?

20:26.033 --> 20:28.755
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?

20:28.916 --> 20:33.038
If felt like, "I can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."

20:34.802 --> 20:38.354
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.

20:41.128 --> 20:45.570
Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.

20:51.418 --> 20:55.051
Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

20:55.222 --> 20:56.816
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

20:57.024 --> 21:00.303
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.141
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...

21:02.349 --> 21:06.028
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.

21:06.193 --> 21:08.630
If not, we'll just be a couple
that never has sex.

21:08.796 --> 21:10.355
That's a plan.

21:23.811 --> 21:28.286
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.

21:28.736 --> 21:34.452
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.

21:35.302 --> 21:36.976
Me too.

21:40.908 --> 21:44.108
Well, how come Monica and Chandler
could do it?

21:50.558 --> 21:53.792
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.

21:57.885 --> 22:00.037
I bet you're right.

22:04.852 --> 22:06.445
So...

22:09.817 --> 22:11.537
Yeah.

22:13.581 --> 22:15.300
I love you.

22:16.063 --> 22:18.135
Love you too.

22:19.667 --> 22:22.946
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

22:24.952 --> 22:28.744
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.

22:37.204 --> 22:41.406
- Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away!

22:42.369 --> 22:44.009
I don't wanna see anybody!

22:44.171 --> 22:48.327
I went to the tanning place and the
same thing happened to me. Let me in.

22:48.495 --> 22:49.976
Really?

22:50.257 --> 22:53.058
Did you count Mississippi-ly?

22:54.582 --> 22:55.857
You're not tan.

22:56.023 --> 23:00.977
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.

23:03.470 --> 23:04.460
