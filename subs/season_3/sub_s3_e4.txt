00:05.586 --> 00:08.680
Welcome, everybody!
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!

00:10.124 --> 00:11.352
It's on again!

00:11.592 --> 00:13.924
Guys, could we please
not watch this?

00:14.695 --> 00:17.960
This ever happen to you?
You go to get a glass of milk...

00:18.165 --> 00:21.464
...but these cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open!

00:21.669 --> 00:23.534
Boy, you said it, Mike.

00:26.207 --> 00:29.540
- There's gotta be a better way.
- There is, Kevin!

00:30.010 --> 00:33.309
- Can we please turn this off?
- No way, Kevin!

00:33.514 --> 00:37.109
What if I told you there's
a new product that guarantees...

00:37.351 --> 00:40.218
...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?

00:40.521 --> 00:42.716
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

00:44.959 --> 00:47.621
- Intrigued?
- You're flinging, flanging right I am!

00:49.296 --> 00:53.824
This is the first time he's used this.
You'll see how easy this is to do.

00:54.735 --> 00:57.761
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy!

00:57.972 --> 01:00.372
Now I can have milk every day.

01:02.776 --> 01:04.869
I can't watch this anymore.

01:05.079 --> 01:07.673
You've suffered enough.
We'll change it.

01:07.882 --> 01:12.979
- How many times has this happened?
- There's gotta be a better way!

01:18.459 --> 01:20.825
The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel

02:03.837 --> 02:06.431
It's official.
There are no good movies.

02:06.607 --> 02:09.440
So let's go to a bad one,
and make out.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.274
Perhaps you'd like me to turn so you
can bunny-bump against my back?

02:20.888 --> 02:23.982
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Maybe you can tell me.

02:24.191 --> 02:27.820
My agent wants to know why I didn't
show up at my audition today...

02:28.095 --> 02:31.428
...my first good one in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?

02:31.865 --> 02:34.527
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...

02:35.102 --> 02:36.797
...but it wasn't me.

02:37.004 --> 02:39.666
Yes, it was.
It was him!

02:40.674 --> 02:42.232
Okay, it was me!

02:44.278 --> 02:47.770
- How was it you?
- Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

02:48.015 --> 02:50.882
Chandler was in the closet,
counting to 10...

02:51.151 --> 02:54.314
...and I hadn't found a place
to hide yet.

02:54.555 --> 02:58.992
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.291
Yep, that's my audition.

03:01.495 --> 03:04.396
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.

03:04.598 --> 03:08.398
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.

03:08.602 --> 03:12.163
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.

03:12.373 --> 03:16.366
Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.

03:16.577 --> 03:17.805
Well, that is unfair!

03:18.078 --> 03:20.672
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was my fault.

03:20.881 --> 03:23.816
You can't. The casting director
doesn't talk to friends.

03:24.018 --> 03:27.283
- She only talks to agents.
- What a sad little life she must lead.

03:30.991 --> 03:33.824
- What are you doing?
- No, I know, I know.

03:35.162 --> 03:38.529
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.228
Is Anne there for Phoebe?

03:42.669 --> 03:44.728
She'll know what it's about.

03:44.938 --> 03:46.428
Hang up. Hang up right...

03:48.442 --> 03:52.037
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got
a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

03:52.246 --> 03:55.738
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?

03:56.016 --> 03:58.109
Estelle? I don't know
what to do with her.

03:58.352 --> 04:02.652
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world doesn't stop.

04:03.857 --> 04:05.415
Is anybody else scared?

04:07.027 --> 04:10.929
If Joey loses this audition, then
that is it for Estelle. I don't care!

04:11.932 --> 04:15.732
Annie, you are a doll. What time can
you see him? I need a pen. Pen!

04:22.709 --> 04:26.304
Get the woman a pad!
Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

04:26.780 --> 04:29.476
Oh, now you want a pad.

04:36.990 --> 04:41.484
That's funny. Ugly Naked Guy's naked,
but his dog's wearing a sweater.

04:45.165 --> 04:46.325
Hey!

04:46.500 --> 04:48.434
Where's my boy?

04:48.602 --> 04:50.695
Here's my boy!

04:50.871 --> 04:54.898
And here's his Barbie!

04:59.880 --> 05:02.075
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

05:03.016 --> 05:05.644
He picked it out at the store.
He loves it.

05:05.853 --> 05:08.378
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.

05:08.689 --> 05:11.283
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

05:12.659 --> 05:14.456
Yeah, it's cute.

05:14.661 --> 05:17.494
Why does he have it again?

05:17.731 --> 05:20.996
So he's got a doll. So what?

05:21.502 --> 05:24.994
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...

05:25.272 --> 05:27.035
...in show business.

05:27.541 --> 05:29.509
This wouldn't have
to do with the fact...

05:29.710 --> 05:31.735
...that he's being raised
by two women?

05:33.247 --> 05:38.310
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.

05:38.519 --> 05:41.784
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie.

05:41.989 --> 05:45.356
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?

05:46.293 --> 05:47.590
No? Okay.

05:48.228 --> 05:51.925
How about a Dino-Soldier?

05:56.236 --> 05:57.760
You are so pathetic.

05:57.971 --> 06:01.532
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?

06:07.581 --> 06:09.208
I gotta go to work.

06:10.918 --> 06:12.749
Has anybody seen my left boob?

06:14.621 --> 06:17.055
I loved that movie.

06:20.394 --> 06:22.555
Here it is.
What are you doing?

06:23.163 --> 06:25.461
I'm sorry. It just felt nice.

06:29.269 --> 06:30.463
Answer the phone.

06:30.904 --> 06:35.000
I only got one arm. You should
do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.

06:35.976 --> 06:37.500
Just do it! It's Janice.

06:37.778 --> 06:40.713
And if I get it, I'll have
to see her tonight.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.941
That's great.
I'll have to see her tonight.

06:45.152 --> 06:47.416
Why don't you want to see Janice?

06:47.621 --> 06:49.589
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...

06:49.823 --> 06:54.760
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

06:56.496 --> 06:58.487
And that's bad...

06:58.799 --> 07:01.290
...because you hate chicken piccata?

07:03.103 --> 07:07.631
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.

07:07.841 --> 07:09.604
Suddenly, we were this "couple."

07:09.810 --> 07:12.335
And this alarm started going off
in my head.

07:12.646 --> 07:14.978
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"

07:17.017 --> 07:21.147
Men are unbelievable. Janice thought
she was giving you chicken.

07:21.321 --> 07:24.586
She didn't think she was giving you
scary chicken.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.315
What is it with you people?

07:26.627 --> 07:29.425
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

07:29.796 --> 07:31.889
I know. That...

07:33.000 --> 07:37.699
That's why I don't want to go tonight.
I'm afraid I'll say something stupid.

07:37.971 --> 07:41.134
You mean that "guy thing" where
you act mean and distant...

07:41.341 --> 07:43.036
...until we break up with you?

07:43.243 --> 07:44.437
You know about that?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.007
What do I do?
I wanna get past this.

07:48.282 --> 07:50.546
I don't want to be afraid
of commitment.

07:50.784 --> 07:54.151
I want to go through the tunnel
to the other side!

07:54.988 --> 07:58.287
Where there's no fear of commitment.

07:58.759 --> 08:00.750
Do we have any...

08:04.665 --> 08:06.428
Do we have any thoughts here?

08:06.733 --> 08:09.531
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...

08:09.803 --> 08:13.102
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.

08:15.342 --> 08:19.745
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.

08:20.013 --> 08:22.914
Fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.

08:23.150 --> 08:25.175
You're afraid of bugs.

08:25.485 --> 08:26.918
Get a bug.

08:29.723 --> 08:31.588
You have a fear of commitment.

08:31.825 --> 08:36.159
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was!

08:36.363 --> 08:38.627
Amazingly, that makes sense.

08:39.399 --> 08:42.596
- Do you think?
- Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

08:42.836 --> 08:43.928
Jump off the high dive!

08:44.204 --> 08:47.901
Stare down the barrel of the gun!
Pee into the wind!

08:49.609 --> 08:52.043
If I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...

08:52.245 --> 08:55.442
...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing
every which way.

08:59.953 --> 09:02.615
Listen to this and tell me
what you think.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.923
That's interesting.

09:09.096 --> 09:12.156
- Honey?
- Oh, because it's a beeper.

09:13.233 --> 09:17.135
It's your audition from this morning!
Can I use the phone?

09:17.337 --> 09:22.240
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and pretend agents.

09:22.743 --> 09:25.075
Come on, baby! Come on!

09:26.380 --> 09:29.543
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay
returning a page.

09:29.750 --> 09:33.311
Okay, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.181
Very nice touch.

09:36.390 --> 09:37.789
Okay, go ahead.

09:39.226 --> 09:41.251
Talk, talk, talk!

09:41.762 --> 09:43.286
Hi, Annie?

09:43.463 --> 09:44.953
Fantastic. You got it!

09:47.801 --> 09:52.465
Will he work for scale, you ask me?
Well, I don't know about that.

09:52.672 --> 09:54.867
Except that I do and he will.

09:55.242 --> 09:57.710
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

09:57.911 --> 10:03.315
I would love to have lunch with you!
How about we have lunch next...

10:03.517 --> 10:05.508
Went through a tunnel.

10:05.719 --> 10:06.879
Unbelievable.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.883
Oh, thank you so much!

10:09.389 --> 10:13.587
It was really fun. I mean, I've never
talked on a car phone before.

10:14.428 --> 10:17.295
You are so amazing!
Could you do me this huge favor?

10:17.564 --> 10:20.931
There's another audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.

10:21.134 --> 10:23.625
I don't know.
It was fun one time, but...

10:23.837 --> 10:26.328
Please? It would just be
this one more.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.268
- Well, actually it's two.
- Two?

10:29.476 --> 10:35.415
Well, really it's three. Please?
You're so good at it. I love you.

10:35.982 --> 10:39.383
- Okay. But just these three, right?
- No, it's four.

10:43.824 --> 10:45.985
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?

10:46.593 --> 10:48.959
Because I wanted...

10:49.162 --> 10:51.153
...to give you this.

10:52.098 --> 10:55.693
Are you a puppy!

10:59.272 --> 11:00.739
Contact paper!

11:02.275 --> 11:05.210
What do you say when someone
you're sleeping with...

11:05.479 --> 11:07.037
...gives you contact paper?

11:07.714 --> 11:12.208
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go...

11:12.486 --> 11:15.080
...in your brand new drawer!

11:17.190 --> 11:19.556
See, the drawer actually
goes in my dresser.

11:20.594 --> 11:24.792
- You didn't have to do this.
- Yes, I did.

11:24.965 --> 11:27.593
Yes, I did.
Because you're my girlfriend...

11:27.834 --> 11:30.735
...and that's what girlfriends
should get.

11:32.672 --> 11:35.197
Well, I gotta buy a vowel...

11:36.710 --> 11:40.510
...because, oh, my God!

11:40.780 --> 11:43.078
Who would've thought that someday...

11:43.250 --> 11:46.219
...Chandler Bing would buy me
a drawer?

11:47.454 --> 11:49.649
Well, not me.

11:50.423 --> 11:53.688
But that's what's happened.
And there's more.

11:55.729 --> 11:57.560
We should take a trip.

11:58.198 --> 11:59.187
We should?

11:59.466 --> 12:02.196
We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.

12:02.769 --> 12:04.737
And I wanna meet your parents.

12:04.938 --> 12:07.964
We should take a trip
with your parents!

12:11.945 --> 12:17.349
I don't think we need to because
you're tripping me out right now!

12:17.517 --> 12:19.849
- Are you okay?
- No, I am.

12:20.387 --> 12:22.287
I actually am! This is amazing.

12:22.556 --> 12:25.889
My entire life, I have feared
this place.

12:26.059 --> 12:29.358
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?

12:29.529 --> 12:32.930
I could probably say, "Let's move in
together," and I'd be okay.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.733
You probably want us
to move in together?

12:36.903 --> 12:39.963
- It doesn't scare me!
- Yeah, well it scares me!

12:40.240 --> 12:44.006
I'm not even divorced yet! You just
invited me over here for pasta...

12:44.277 --> 12:47.337
...and now you're talking
about moving in together.

12:47.614 --> 12:49.309
And I wasn't even that hungry.

12:49.649 --> 12:53.813
You know what? It's getting really
late, and I should just...

12:54.020 --> 12:56.784
Don't go! I've scared you!
I've said too much!

12:56.990 --> 13:00.653
I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love!

13:07.267 --> 13:09.132
Hey, Janice, it's me.

13:10.437 --> 13:14.965
I wanted to apologize in advance for
having chased you down the street.

13:23.683 --> 13:25.981
Here you go, honey. This will help.

13:26.786 --> 13:28.777
So I catch up to her
and she says...

13:29.022 --> 13:32.480
...this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.489
That is never good.

13:34.694 --> 13:35.854
Then I got all...

13:36.830 --> 13:39.298
...needy and clingy.

13:39.933 --> 13:44.233
- You didn't beg, did you?
- I said please.

13:44.437 --> 13:48.430
Was it please with one E
in the middle or lots of E's?

13:48.942 --> 13:50.637
Oh, dear Lord, I begged.

13:51.544 --> 13:54.911
Wait a minute. Maybe it's
not so bad. How did you leave it?

13:55.115 --> 13:56.514
She said she'd call me.

13:59.285 --> 14:01.116
Oh, God.

14:01.287 --> 14:04.120
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

14:04.557 --> 14:07.549
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.

14:07.727 --> 14:11.288
Yeah, well, it's that
low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

14:11.531 --> 14:13.999
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.

14:14.968 --> 14:18.426
When you're getting screwed over all
the time, you gotta switch to low fat.

14:18.638 --> 14:20.469
Yeah, you do.

14:21.341 --> 14:23.309
You don't think I'm terminal?

14:23.476 --> 14:27.776
Not at all. You're not terminal.
We just need some damage control.

14:27.981 --> 14:31.473
- Okay. Should I call her?
- No!

14:32.485 --> 14:36.387
Very critical time. If you feel
yourself reaching for that phone...

14:36.623 --> 14:39.057
...go shopping, get your butt
in a bubble bath.

14:39.259 --> 14:42.854
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

14:43.563 --> 14:45.622
Aloof?

14:47.267 --> 14:49.701
She needs to know you're not needy.

14:49.903 --> 14:54.636
So what you have to do is accidentally
run into her on purpose...

14:54.808 --> 14:56.776
...and then act aloof.

14:57.877 --> 15:00.641
- And then I'll be okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

15:02.115 --> 15:04.106
So I'm not gonna lose her?

15:04.284 --> 15:07.412
Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.

15:10.657 --> 15:13.421
I said, "So I'm not gonna lose her?"

15:20.867 --> 15:22.129
Guess who's here!

15:22.368 --> 15:25.337
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

15:25.505 --> 15:29.498
Real American hero
I'm G.I. Joe!

15:29.676 --> 15:32.042
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

15:32.245 --> 15:35.806
G.I. Joe?
You really think he'll fall for that?

15:36.950 --> 15:40.442
G.I. Joe?
Cool! Can I play?

15:42.155 --> 15:45.784
Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects
U.S. Oil interests overseas!

15:45.959 --> 15:48.291
Go, Joe!

15:49.295 --> 15:50.660
Hello?

15:50.864 --> 15:53.059
- There you are!
- No, it's not. Sorry.

15:53.266 --> 15:55.928
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.
Phoebe!

15:56.102 --> 15:59.435
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay!
See, I didn't recognize you...

15:59.706 --> 16:01.037
...in those pants.

16:02.776 --> 16:06.576
That TV movie I went in for, did you
hear anything? I think I got a shot.

16:07.413 --> 16:09.643
Yes, they called!
You didn't get it!

16:10.383 --> 16:14.149
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:14.454 --> 16:16.820
That's okay. These things happen.

16:17.090 --> 16:19.923
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?

16:20.160 --> 16:22.788
You're in a terrible,
terrible business.

16:23.496 --> 16:27.125
I don't want to be the person
who makes you look like that.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.301
I'm okay. See?

16:31.137 --> 16:33.469
Now you're sad and creepy.

16:34.007 --> 16:35.565
I'm sorry. I quit.

16:36.309 --> 16:40.211
No, no, you can't quit!
You're the best agent I ever had.

16:40.413 --> 16:43.940
Rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.

16:44.150 --> 16:48.644
They said they'd never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent.

16:49.255 --> 16:50.847
They actually said that?

16:51.057 --> 16:55.016
Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job!

16:55.228 --> 16:58.755
This is why you have to do
this job! Agents always lie.

16:58.965 --> 17:01.934
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way."

17:02.168 --> 17:03.965
But this? I can use this.

17:04.170 --> 17:07.105
I can work on a new accent.

17:07.941 --> 17:11.274
Yeah, okay. If it
helps you, okay. Yeah.

17:11.477 --> 17:15.140
You'll never get me, Joe!

17:27.827 --> 17:29.727
No, thank you.

17:31.598 --> 17:36.001
- Chandler!
- Hello, Janice.

17:38.238 --> 17:40.035
What are you doing here?

17:40.673 --> 17:42.368
Just a bit of shopping.

17:42.642 --> 17:43.973
How have you been?

17:45.545 --> 17:47.570
Are you being British?

17:49.883 --> 17:51.214
Not anymore.

17:52.352 --> 17:55.480
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.

17:55.822 --> 17:58.222
Were you here waiting for me?

18:02.028 --> 18:03.120
I'm just...

18:03.663 --> 18:06.325
...picking up some things for a party.

18:08.268 --> 18:09.360
Barley?

18:10.270 --> 18:12.363
What kind of party serves barley?

18:12.572 --> 18:15.666
I'm sorry if my friends aren't
as sophisticated as yours.

18:17.143 --> 18:19.668
- Where is this party?
- Here in Chelsea.

18:20.079 --> 18:21.546
Whose party is it?

18:21.748 --> 18:22.874
A woman's.

18:23.082 --> 18:24.140
What woman?

18:25.585 --> 18:27.746
Chelsea.

18:28.821 --> 18:32.018
Either you're seeing somebody
behind my back...

18:32.225 --> 18:34.921
...which would make you
the world's biggest jerk...

18:35.128 --> 18:37.426
...or you're pretending
to see somebody...

18:37.630 --> 18:41.191
...which makes you so pathetic
I could cry right here!

18:41.401 --> 18:44.893
So which of these two guys
do you want to be?

18:45.939 --> 18:47.702
Can I be that guy?

18:50.310 --> 18:55.179
Okay, we got some more good
rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.

18:55.648 --> 18:56.774
Okay. Shoot.

18:57.050 --> 19:00.611
- Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.
- I didn't get it?

19:00.820 --> 19:05.348
No. They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being."

19:06.259 --> 19:08.284
So you can work on that.

19:09.295 --> 19:10.284
Great.

19:10.763 --> 19:11.752
What else?

19:12.065 --> 19:15.933
The off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb."

19:16.102 --> 19:19.128
Oh, no wait. I'm sorry.
That's "pretty dumb."

19:19.405 --> 19:21.600
Look, it's okay, no, no, no.
Really.

19:21.841 --> 19:22.899
Look...

19:23.309 --> 19:25.436
...I really appreciate this...

19:26.312 --> 19:28.576
...but I'm gonna have to
go back to Estelle.

19:29.449 --> 19:32.350
Don't get me wrong.
You're a better agent than she is...

19:32.652 --> 19:36.418
...but at least with her, I don't want
to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

19:37.623 --> 19:39.614
Yeah, no, I understand.

19:39.826 --> 19:41.293
You do? Thanks. Okay.

19:41.627 --> 19:42.616
Sorry.

19:46.466 --> 19:47.592
Wait a minute.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.096
Wait a minute.

19:49.335 --> 19:52.668
Did you make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?

19:52.939 --> 19:54.304
Oh, he caught me.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.438
I am so busted!

19:59.645 --> 20:01.806
That's what I suspected!

20:05.218 --> 20:07.277
And then I just, you know...

20:08.154 --> 20:11.453
...threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.

20:12.058 --> 20:15.824
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"
not "a doof."

20:17.497 --> 20:20.330
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?

20:21.901 --> 20:24.426
Is it time for the good ice cream now?

20:25.438 --> 20:27.133
- It's time.
- Yeah, it is.

20:30.276 --> 20:32.972
Everything's gonna be okay.
You know why?

20:33.146 --> 20:37.446
Because you got 65 grams of fat
coming your way.

20:40.319 --> 20:42.947
Hello? Hi, Janice.

20:44.023 --> 20:46.753
Can you hold on for a second?
Okay.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.984
Okay. What do I do?

20:49.195 --> 20:51.163
I don't know.
This is unprecedented.

20:51.364 --> 20:53.992
If we did what you did,
a man would never call.

20:54.767 --> 20:58.225
I got it! Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off!

20:58.438 --> 21:00.770
- Be sleepy!
- Yes! And grumpy!

21:00.973 --> 21:03.601
What are you...?
Stop naming dwarfs!

21:06.345 --> 21:08.575
Hello, Janice? Hi.

21:08.748 --> 21:11.410
I'm so glad that you called.

21:12.618 --> 21:17.021
I know I've been acting
really weird lately...

21:18.357 --> 21:21.383
...and it's just because
I'm crazy about you...

21:24.197 --> 21:28.361
...and I just got stupid and scared...

21:28.568 --> 21:30.536
...and stupid a couple more times.

21:31.637 --> 21:32.626
And I'm sorry.

21:34.207 --> 21:35.196
Really?

21:37.310 --> 21:38.368
Really?

21:39.579 --> 21:41.706
He's so lucky.
If Janice were a guy...

21:41.881 --> 21:45.112
...she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.

21:46.085 --> 21:47.450
I love you too.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.344
It's so unfair!

21:57.396 --> 21:59.421
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!

21:59.599 --> 22:03.695
I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.

22:03.970 --> 22:06.495
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

22:06.706 --> 22:08.901
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

22:09.108 --> 22:13.101
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.

22:14.614 --> 22:18.448
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

22:18.684 --> 22:20.914
You used to dress up like a woman.

22:26.859 --> 22:28.690
What?

22:28.895 --> 22:31.261
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?

22:31.464 --> 22:33.193
What are you talking about?

22:33.432 --> 22:36.663
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?

22:36.836 --> 22:39.304
Okay. You are totally
making this up.

22:39.672 --> 22:41.503
How can you not remember?

22:41.774 --> 22:43.708
You made us call you "Bea"?

22:50.216 --> 22:52.309
Oh, God.

22:52.652 --> 22:56.110
I've literally never been this happy.

22:56.389 --> 22:58.516
Wasn't there a little song?

22:58.724 --> 23:01.124
Oh, please, God,
let there be a song.

23:01.327 --> 23:03.352
There was no song.
There was no song.

23:03.563 --> 23:05.087
- I am Bea
- Okay.

23:05.464 --> 23:07.125
- I drink tea...
- That's enough.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.799
Won't you?

23:09.902 --> 23:11.233
Won't you?

23:12.305 --> 23:13.738
Won't you?

23:15.208 --> 23:17.802
Won't you dance around with me?

23:23.449 --> 23:25.974
I am Bea

23:26.152 --> 23:28.848
I drink tea

23:29.021 --> 23:34.482
Won't you dance around with...?

23:41.968 --> 23:42.957
Ross!

23:46.639 --> 23:47.628
