WEBVTT

00:01.849 --> 00:03.373
Here you go, Pheebs.

00:03.551 --> 00:06.111
Who else wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

00:06.287 --> 00:08.312
- I will have one.
- I do.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.883
- That's okay.
- I'm not having one.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.551
No, no. It's just my tooth.

00:14.795 --> 00:16.660
- All right.
- I'll have one.

00:17.898 --> 00:20.366
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

00:20.534 --> 00:24.868
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

00:25.039 --> 00:28.270
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

00:28.442 --> 00:34.210
It's very unsettling to see all those
metal tools just flying around.

00:35.983 --> 00:37.245
Why can't you go to him?

00:37.418 --> 00:42.321
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

00:43.657 --> 00:46.490
That is so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist...

00:46.727 --> 00:48.854
...I look down the hygienist's blouse.

00:49.763 --> 00:52.197
Phoebe, what?

00:52.366 --> 00:53.390
What?

00:53.734 --> 00:55.326
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

00:55.603 --> 00:57.969
And then there was John,
my mailman.

00:58.272 --> 01:00.866
And then my cowboy friend,
Albino Bob.

01:02.109 --> 01:04.270
And all these people actually died?

01:04.445 --> 01:06.606
Yes. While I was in the chair.

01:06.780 --> 01:09.010
That's why I take such
good care of my teeth.

01:09.183 --> 01:12.277
It's not about oral hygiene.
I floss to save lives.

01:13.287 --> 01:15.221
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

01:15.389 --> 01:19.086
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.750
It's just a coincidence.

01:20.928 --> 01:25.262
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

01:26.600 --> 01:28.727
The One With the Giant Poking Device

02:13.314 --> 02:14.781
Thanks, Gunther.

02:15.849 --> 02:17.441
Can I get a napkin too?

02:17.618 --> 02:20.246
Like you don't already
have everything.

02:25.592 --> 02:29.289
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist. Just go.

02:29.463 --> 02:31.624
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

02:31.799 --> 02:35.030
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

02:35.936 --> 02:36.925
I promise.

02:37.104 --> 02:40.335
Although, don't feel
like you can't visit.

02:41.575 --> 02:43.975
Hey, is Chandler here?

02:45.446 --> 02:47.880
No. No, he's not.

02:48.449 --> 02:53.182
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

02:53.354 --> 02:54.412
What?

02:54.588 --> 02:57.614
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

02:57.825 --> 03:01.090
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be...

03:01.261 --> 03:02.250
...to not.

03:03.230 --> 03:06.427
You can't keep this to yourself.
If you know, you have to tell him.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.864
It'll kill him.
It'll just kill him.

03:09.036 --> 03:11.937
Wait until I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

03:17.511 --> 03:22.676
Ugly Naked Guy's using his new
hammock. It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

03:23.484 --> 03:25.611
I'm going to the dentist.
So listen...

03:25.786 --> 03:30.086
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

03:30.257 --> 03:32.851
...or that can fall on you...

03:33.027 --> 03:34.324
...or...

03:34.495 --> 03:35.962
Or just look out!

03:37.865 --> 03:39.992
And I also just want to...

03:40.167 --> 03:43.295
I just want to tell you all that...

03:48.575 --> 03:51.840
Okay. I have a problem. I have
to go into work for a few hours.

03:52.012 --> 03:54.810
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

03:54.982 --> 03:55.971
What did they do?

03:56.150 --> 03:59.244
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

04:00.220 --> 04:05.021
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

04:05.526 --> 04:07.517
Do you want me
to watch Ben for you?

04:07.694 --> 04:09.719
That's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

04:09.897 --> 04:11.922
Wait, hello!
What about me?

04:12.099 --> 04:15.557
You? You want to watch Ben.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.306
That would be great!
I just asked Monica...

04:22.476 --> 04:24.808
...because I know how empty
her life is.

04:30.317 --> 04:31.909
I got a science question.

04:32.086 --> 04:38.548
If the Homo sapiens were,
in fact, "homo" sapiens...

04:39.159 --> 04:42.458
...is that why they're extinct?

04:44.631 --> 04:47.862
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

04:48.035 --> 04:51.095
Hey, I'm not judging.

04:52.339 --> 04:54.773
Look, Benny. Spoon!

04:54.942 --> 04:57.069
Spoon!

04:58.045 --> 05:01.446
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

05:01.615 --> 05:03.947
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

05:04.118 --> 05:06.018
You wanna show Rachel?
Come here.

05:06.186 --> 05:08.518
You wanna do something fun?
Okay.

05:19.733 --> 05:22.759
Who's so brave?
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

05:22.936 --> 05:24.836
- You're so brave.
- You're okay.

05:25.005 --> 05:27.269
He's fine.
Let's just put him down.

05:27.441 --> 05:30.274
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

05:30.511 --> 05:34.743
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

05:34.948 --> 05:36.973
Nothing, because we're not
telling him.

05:37.184 --> 05:38.310
- We're not?
- No.

05:38.485 --> 05:40.817
All right, I like that.

05:41.255 --> 05:43.553
So we're okay.
We're okay, aren't we?

05:43.724 --> 05:45.954
No, we're not okay.
There's a bump.

05:46.126 --> 05:47.286
What bump?

05:47.461 --> 05:50.021
Oh, my God! Well, push it in!
Push it in!

05:50.197 --> 05:52.995
I cannot push it in!

05:53.734 --> 05:55.861
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.

05:56.036 --> 05:57.367
- That's it.
- Okay.

05:57.538 --> 05:58.732
- I got it!
- Okay.

05:58.906 --> 06:00.567
The second Ross walks in...

06:00.741 --> 06:03.608
...take him to your bedroom,
and do whatever it is you do...

06:03.777 --> 06:05.540
...that makes him go...

06:07.481 --> 06:09.176
Or...

06:10.584 --> 06:12.518
...we could put a hat on his head.

06:12.686 --> 06:17.521
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

06:17.691 --> 06:19.283
I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

06:19.493 --> 06:21.859
Because he'll know what to do?

06:22.196 --> 06:23.891
Oh, my God.
You're a genius!

06:24.097 --> 06:25.860
It's kind of sewn on.

06:26.033 --> 06:27.500
- Give it. Give it.
- Okay.

06:32.172 --> 06:35.608
It's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

06:40.414 --> 06:43.110
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.852
Do you think these pearls are nice?

06:47.020 --> 06:48.817
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

06:50.190 --> 06:54.092
Janice's birthday is coming up.
I wanna get her something special.

06:54.995 --> 06:57.054
- Come in here with me.
- Wait!

06:59.600 --> 07:02.000
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

07:02.169 --> 07:04.933
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

07:05.505 --> 07:09.134
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba Bubba birthday."

07:10.544 --> 07:13.104
I would like to get her
something serious.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.441
You want something serious.

07:15.616 --> 07:18.915
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those...

07:19.086 --> 07:20.610
...barium enemas.

07:22.823 --> 07:25.314
Those are dead serious.

07:25.492 --> 07:28.518
And you know she'll never
get one for herself.

07:29.563 --> 07:33.329
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

07:33.500 --> 07:36.264
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

07:36.436 --> 07:38.700
You just can't. You can't,
You can't, you can't!

07:38.872 --> 07:40.772
Why not?

07:42.109 --> 07:43.770
Oh, God.

07:45.212 --> 07:47.043
Here's the thing.

07:47.781 --> 07:49.908
This is the thing.
Okay, the thing is...

07:50.083 --> 07:51.175
What is the thing?

07:52.886 --> 07:56.117
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

07:56.323 --> 07:59.258
...and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

08:01.128 --> 08:02.493
What?

08:02.663 --> 08:05.598
They were in his office.

08:07.567 --> 08:10.536
She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

08:10.704 --> 08:12.365
I'm telling you, I saw it.

08:12.539 --> 08:14.473
Well, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

08:14.641 --> 08:16.199
I'm not wrong.

08:16.376 --> 08:18.970
I wish I was.

08:20.347 --> 08:22.542
I'm sorry.

08:25.952 --> 08:28.614
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now.

08:31.391 --> 08:36.226
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.

08:36.997 --> 08:40.091
Oh! You're alive!
You're alive!

08:41.435 --> 08:44.029
I promised you no one
would die, didn't I?

08:44.204 --> 08:47.696
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

08:47.874 --> 08:50.900
Sure. We have no money.
Go ahead.

08:51.912 --> 08:55.439
Hey, you're not dead!
Okay, see you.

08:57.351 --> 08:59.148
Monica.

08:59.353 --> 09:01.821
Oh, my God!
He just said my name!

09:01.988 --> 09:03.819
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

09:04.524 --> 09:06.992
Monica bang!

09:09.629 --> 09:12.029
Okay, I heard that.

09:12.199 --> 09:14.326
Did he just say, "Monica bang"?

09:14.568 --> 09:17.901
Oh, my God!
He's gonna rat me out!

09:18.071 --> 09:20.767
Monica bang!

09:21.174 --> 09:24.507
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

09:24.678 --> 09:27.238
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

09:27.414 --> 09:29.507
You see? We all do it all the time.

09:29.716 --> 09:31.115
See? Watch this.

09:33.053 --> 09:35.920
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

09:36.223 --> 09:37.247
Ben bang!

09:37.457 --> 09:38.856
Rachel bang!

09:39.359 --> 09:41.418
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

09:41.928 --> 09:44.396
- Isn't it fun?
- Look at that!

09:44.865 --> 09:46.423
We all do it!

09:46.600 --> 09:49.330
- Okay, I'm stopping now.
- Are you okay?

09:49.503 --> 09:53.166
Yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

10:04.284 --> 10:06.548
How's my Bing-a-ling?

10:10.390 --> 10:11.880
I don't know.

10:12.058 --> 10:13.457
You tell me.

10:14.528 --> 10:17.088
Anything you want to tell me?

10:17.764 --> 10:19.493
Because if you...
You should...

10:19.666 --> 10:21.793
You would tell me.

10:23.370 --> 10:26.271
Why are your eyes so wide?

10:26.940 --> 10:28.931
You tell me.

10:29.109 --> 10:31.737
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

10:31.912 --> 10:34.346
Oh, no. That was you!

10:34.581 --> 10:36.139
Oh, my God!

10:36.316 --> 10:37.943
- All right!
- How did you know?

10:38.118 --> 10:40.245
Joey told me.
He saw you two kissing.

10:40.420 --> 10:42.445
In the park?

10:43.089 --> 10:45.922
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

10:46.092 --> 10:48.890
- Just those two!
- Why? Why? Why?

10:49.062 --> 10:51.792
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

10:51.965 --> 10:55.230
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm so, so...

10:55.902 --> 10:58.029
I'm so, so sorry. I just...

11:00.073 --> 11:02.803
What happened was I...
I can't breathe.

11:03.343 --> 11:06.744
Can you get me a bag or something?

11:06.913 --> 11:09.973
Here. Here. Here.

11:13.153 --> 11:15.121
- It's the receipt.
- I'll take it.

11:16.990 --> 11:19.254
Look, I've got to know.

11:21.428 --> 11:24.295
Are you finished with me?

11:25.799 --> 11:27.630
Are you finished with him?

11:31.771 --> 11:34.239
Do you still love him?

11:36.943 --> 11:39.605
Do you still love me?

11:40.380 --> 11:41.711
All right, look...

11:42.782 --> 11:45.410
...l'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

11:45.585 --> 11:47.644
So which is it?

11:48.788 --> 11:50.278
Him or me?

11:59.399 --> 12:01.492
I don't know.

12:03.503 --> 12:07.564
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

12:13.547 --> 12:17.950
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

12:18.118 --> 12:21.918
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

12:22.088 --> 12:25.489
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

12:25.659 --> 12:28.287
And number two, I...

12:29.896 --> 12:33.263
- What?
- You said, "number two."

12:36.236 --> 12:38.329
I also said, "number one."

12:38.505 --> 12:40.700
I know.

12:42.275 --> 12:43.572
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi!

12:43.743 --> 12:45.734
How's my little boy?

12:45.912 --> 12:47.812
He's perfect.
Aren't you, Ben?

12:47.981 --> 12:52.042
- He's never been better.
- What did you do, take him whaling?

12:53.587 --> 12:55.020
Monica.

12:55.188 --> 12:59.921
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

13:00.093 --> 13:02.357
Monica bang!

13:02.796 --> 13:07.290
That's right. That's what
I'd sound like if I exploded.

13:09.102 --> 13:11.798
The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know...

13:11.972 --> 13:14.133
...and everyone is alive!

13:18.945 --> 13:22.403
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

13:27.821 --> 13:29.584
My God, I killed another one!

13:29.756 --> 13:33.817
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

13:34.394 --> 13:36.089
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

13:36.262 --> 13:39.026
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

13:39.199 --> 13:40.632
We should call somebody.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.031
And tell them what? The naked guy
we stare at isn't moving?

13:44.204 --> 13:46.502
We've got to find out if he's alive.

13:46.673 --> 13:49.164
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

13:49.342 --> 13:51.071
Well, there is one way.

13:51.244 --> 13:54.042
His window's open.
I say...

13:54.214 --> 13:56.580
...we poke him.

14:01.321 --> 14:03.949
You know how we save
all those chopsticks...

14:04.124 --> 14:06.820
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

14:07.994 --> 14:10.656
Well, now we got a reason.

14:11.197 --> 14:12.323
What?

14:12.499 --> 14:15.468
We're fashioning a very long
poking device.

14:17.337 --> 14:18.804
All right.

14:21.441 --> 14:23.204
Hey, what's the matter?

14:26.146 --> 14:28.137
I talked to Janice.

14:28.314 --> 14:31.340
Oh, my God.
Is she going back to him?

14:31.518 --> 14:33.281
She doesn't know.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.921
Says she loves us both.

14:36.623 --> 14:39.456
I woke up this morning,
I was in love.

14:39.626 --> 14:42.151
I was happy!

14:42.996 --> 14:45.726
It serves me right for buying
that 12-pack of condoms.

14:48.001 --> 14:52.267
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

14:54.974 --> 14:58.535
What are you gonna do?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.945
I don't know.

15:02.649 --> 15:05.846
You know? What would you do?

15:07.787 --> 15:10.881
- It doesn't matter what I'd do.
- Come on. Come on. Tell me.

15:13.793 --> 15:16.284
All right, you're...

15:16.696 --> 15:20.257
You're probably not gonna
want to hear this...

15:21.935 --> 15:25.598
...but if it was me,
and this is just me...

15:25.772 --> 15:28.502
...I would bow out.
- What?

15:30.276 --> 15:33.370
What are you talking about?

15:35.348 --> 15:38.146
They have a kid together,
you know?

15:38.318 --> 15:42.152
They're, like, a family.

15:42.689 --> 15:44.748
And if, I don't know...

15:44.924 --> 15:48.052
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

15:48.228 --> 15:51.197
...I know I wouldn't wanna be
the guy who stood in the way.

15:55.902 --> 15:57.927
You okay?

15:58.938 --> 16:01.202
You...

16:01.374 --> 16:04.207
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

16:06.246 --> 16:09.079
Well, he's finally asleep.

16:09.349 --> 16:13.046
About that bump on his head...

16:13.720 --> 16:15.915
Are you sure it's a new bump?

16:16.089 --> 16:20.321
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

16:20.593 --> 16:24.120
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

16:24.297 --> 16:27.289
It was your first time babysitting.
You did the best you could.

16:27.734 --> 16:29.861
- I did!
- I know.

16:30.036 --> 16:32.334
You have to watch them
all the time.

16:32.539 --> 16:35.372
I did! I watched! I watched!

16:35.575 --> 16:38.840
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

16:39.846 --> 16:42.212
Monica did it?

16:46.586 --> 16:51.421
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

16:51.758 --> 16:52.850
No, why?

16:53.026 --> 16:57.019
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song"...

16:57.197 --> 17:00.325
...which he used to be good at.
Suddenly, he's leaving out E and F.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.903
It's like they just, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

17:06.539 --> 17:11.442
- Really?
- And also, he's walking...

17:11.611 --> 17:12.737
...kind of funny.

17:14.380 --> 17:18.908
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

17:19.085 --> 17:20.882
Yeah, he's in there, just...

17:24.724 --> 17:28.490
Oh, my God!
I wrecked your baby!

17:30.463 --> 17:33.864
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.492
You jerk!

17:35.668 --> 17:40.799
- You know how much I love that kid!
- Monica bang! Monica bang!

17:43.877 --> 17:46.243
I'll get the hat.

17:49.816 --> 17:51.807
I have something to tell you.

17:51.985 --> 17:54.249
And I want you to let me
get through it...

17:54.420 --> 17:56.581
...because...

17:56.756 --> 18:01.216
...it's not gonna be easy.
- Okay.

18:03.496 --> 18:07.023
I think you should go back with Gary.

18:07.667 --> 18:11.103
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

18:11.404 --> 18:14.965
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

18:15.141 --> 18:17.473
Whenever I would see him,
I would always think:

18:17.644 --> 18:21.171
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together."

18:21.347 --> 18:24.544
And I hated that guy.

18:25.285 --> 18:30.279
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.528
It's the right thing to do.

18:43.903 --> 18:45.928
You're right.

18:46.439 --> 18:52.002
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye...

18:52.378 --> 18:56.007
...there's something I really
need you to know.

18:56.182 --> 18:58.946
The way I feel about you...

18:59.118 --> 19:02.417
...it's like I finally understand...

19:02.588 --> 19:06.080
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

19:06.359 --> 19:08.827
You know?
I mean, what we have...

19:08.995 --> 19:12.089
...it's like movie love.

19:12.498 --> 19:15.092
You're my soul mate.

19:15.468 --> 19:20.235
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

19:21.607 --> 19:24.132
Then don't leave me.

19:24.644 --> 19:25.633
What?

19:25.812 --> 19:28.781
Forget what I said.
I was babbling. Pick me!

19:28.948 --> 19:32.645
No, you were right! I gotta give
my marriage another chance.

19:33.519 --> 19:35.419
No, you don't!

19:35.588 --> 19:38.819
I say, you have to give your divorce
another chance!

19:38.992 --> 19:43.588
Sweetie, you should not have
to settle for just half my heart.

19:43.763 --> 19:46.857
I'll settle for half your heart.
I'll settle for a quarter.

19:47.033 --> 19:50.992
I'll settle for a little, tiny...
A ventricle.

19:54.107 --> 19:56.598
I'm sorry.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.246
- Don't go.
- No, I gotta go.

20:04.984 --> 20:06.713
No.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.649
No! No, no.

20:08.821 --> 20:10.880
Honey. Honey.

20:11.057 --> 20:14.083
- People are looking.
- I don't care.

20:14.260 --> 20:15.887
I don't care!

20:16.729 --> 20:19.197
Yeah, okay. I'm...

20:19.365 --> 20:21.765
I'm leaving now.

20:23.503 --> 20:26.529
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

20:29.876 --> 20:33.277
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

20:43.856 --> 20:46.848
Rachel has those in burgundy.

20:49.262 --> 20:54.131
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.235
Fortunately, I have
experience in that area.

20:58.137 --> 21:00.367
What are you, 12 today?

21:00.640 --> 21:05.441
Can we please focus here? A naked
man's life hangs in the balance.

21:05.611 --> 21:07.044
I'm telling you, he's dead.

21:07.213 --> 21:10.649
What we're about to have here
is a dead, fat guy on a stick!

21:11.617 --> 21:14.484
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

21:14.654 --> 21:15.643
Steady.

21:15.822 --> 21:17.551
Steady.

21:17.723 --> 21:19.714
Okay, a little higher.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.483
Careful of the angle.

21:21.661 --> 21:24.391
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

21:28.301 --> 21:31.236
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

21:36.476 --> 21:39.673
He's alive! He's alive!

21:41.247 --> 21:43.681
And yet we're still poking him.

21:43.850 --> 21:46.717
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

21:47.019 --> 21:49.715
He does not look happy.

21:49.889 --> 21:53.052
Now he's showing us
his poking device.

21:54.093 --> 21:58.189
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy!

23:07.433 --> 23:08.422
