WEBVTT

00:02.690 --> 00:03.965
Hi!

00:04.131 --> 00:05.406
- Hey!
- Hi!

00:05.853 --> 00:08.609
- How was the honeymoon?
- Oh, incredible!

00:08.776 --> 00:12.978
Oh, champagne, candle-lit dinners,
moonlight walks on the beach.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.133
It was so romantic.

00:15.342 --> 00:16.936
- Where's Mike?
- He's at the doctor.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.983
He didn't poop while we were there.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.424
- I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
- Oh, why, what's up?

00:24.632 --> 00:27.672
I have an audition for this play,
and I have to speak French...

00:27.835 --> 00:30.910
...which, according to my resume,
I'm fluent in.

00:31.078 --> 00:35.360
- Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
- Yeah, you really shouldn't.

00:35.523 --> 00:38.198
By the way, how was
that yearlong dig in Cairo?

00:39.967 --> 00:41.481
It was okay.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.409
I did not know you spoke French.

00:49.056 --> 00:50.490
You're so sexy.

00:51.298 --> 00:53.861
- Well, so will you help me?
- Sure.

00:56.544 --> 00:59.014
Seriously, stop it.
I'm gonna jump on you.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.461
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:40.628 --> 01:42.541
Why are you wearing my apron?

01:43.310 --> 01:44.711
I'm making cookies for Erica.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.947
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.

01:48.155 --> 01:51.275
When she gets here, is it okay
if I introduce you two as my wife...

01:51.438 --> 01:53.955
...and the woman who's
carrying my child?

01:55.402 --> 01:56.757
No?

01:56.964 --> 01:58.364
Divorce?

02:00.167 --> 02:01.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:01.769 --> 02:04.331
- You know where Rachel is?
- Haven't seen her since morning.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.931
It's unbelievable. She was supposed
to meet me a half-hour ago with Emma.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.735
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:09.937 --> 02:13.137
- These are for Erica!
- She's gonna eat all those cookies?

02:13.300 --> 02:16.660
Well, I want the baby to come out
all cute and fat!

02:18.225 --> 02:21.539
- So why is Erica coming to visit?
- We wanna get to know her better.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.829
She's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist spots:

02:24.992 --> 02:26.825
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.

02:27.034 --> 02:30.713
There's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.

02:30.878 --> 02:35.080
And, you know, there's always
some idiot who goes, "Moo."

02:35.482 --> 02:38.238
Well, if it annoys you so much,
then why do you do it?

02:40.487 --> 02:43.801
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for
showing up 30 minutes late.

02:44.011 --> 02:47.564
No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?

02:47.735 --> 02:50.889
A mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?

02:51.619 --> 02:53.930
My father had a heart attack.

02:54.101 --> 02:56.412
While I was at Barneys.

02:58.906 --> 03:00.420
- Oh, my God, Rach.
- Honey?

03:00.588 --> 03:02.979
- I'm so sorry.
- Is he okay?

03:03.190 --> 03:05.502
Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
but he's heavily sedated.

03:05.673 --> 03:07.666
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long Island with you.

03:07.835 --> 03:12.276
- I mean, you can't be alone right now.
- No, come on, I'm totally okay.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.831
I don't need you to come.

03:15.042 --> 03:20.566
- I can totally handle this on my own.
- Still, still, let me come for me.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.888
Okay. If you really need to.

03:24.051 --> 03:26.966
I bet someone could use one
of Monica's freshly baked cookies.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.246
Oh, I really could.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.977
All right, it seems pretty simple.

03:38.145 --> 03:40.138
Your first line is,
"My name is Claude."

03:40.307 --> 03:42.459
So just repeat after me.

03:50.077 --> 03:52.992
- Well, let's try it again.
- Okay.

03:59.687 --> 04:00.962
It's not...

04:01.128 --> 04:03.086
...quite what I'm saying.

04:03.891 --> 04:06.966
Really?
Sounds exactly the same to me.

04:07.174 --> 04:09.485
- It does, really?
- Yeah.

04:09.657 --> 04:11.091
- Let's just try it again.
- Okay.

04:11.298 --> 04:13.690
- Really listen.
- Got it.

04:24.592 --> 04:26.983
- Hey, you guys!
- Hi.

04:27.154 --> 04:29.751
I want you to meet
someone really special.

04:29.917 --> 04:33.310
Phoebe, this is Erica.
And this is the baby!

04:33.480 --> 04:36.077
- Joey, Erica, baby.
- Hi.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.680
Everyone, Erica! Baby!

04:39.206 --> 04:41.324
Monica. Calm. Self.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.603
- Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.

04:43.771 --> 04:46.492
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.216
Well, welcome to New York City,
or should I say:

04:49.777 --> 04:51.656
New York City.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.615
Why would you say that?

04:55.863 --> 04:57.981
Okay. What are you
gonna be doing today?

04:58.185 --> 05:02.900
Well, I wanna see everything! Times
Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center.

05:03.110 --> 05:06.025
You should walk to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.955
- Oh, yeah, let's do that.
- Great.

05:09.156 --> 05:10.910
This baby better be really good.

05:16.644 --> 05:19.844
Hi. Excuse me, I'm here to see my
father. My name is Rachel Green.

05:20.047 --> 05:22.883
- And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
- Ross, please, this is a hospital.

05:23.050 --> 05:25.168
That actually means something here.

05:25.773 --> 05:27.527
- So can we please go in?
- Absolutely.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.608
Rach, I think I'm gonna
wait out here...

05:29.777 --> 05:33.615
...because my throat is feeling a little
scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.

05:33.821 --> 05:38.216
- Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
- I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.420
- He's under sedation, so he's out.
- I'm feeling better.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.825
Oh, my God.

05:49.116 --> 05:53.512
That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

05:54.441 --> 05:58.040
Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

05:58.245 --> 05:59.805
Oh, great. Are you gonna be okay?

06:00.007 --> 06:03.161
- He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
- Okay.

06:39.086 --> 06:41.443
- Did the TV wake you?
- No.

06:41.609 --> 06:46.004
When you put your feet up on my bed,
you tugged on my catheter.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.060
What are you doing here, Geller?

06:54.221 --> 06:57.341
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.

06:58.265 --> 07:01.978
- So, what's new?
- Oh, I had a little heart attack.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.149
Right. Is it painful?

07:04.351 --> 07:07.312
What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?

07:08.435 --> 07:11.316
Let's see if we can get
that Rachel back in here.

07:11.478 --> 07:15.316
So, what's new with you? Knocked up
any more of my daughters lately?

07:15.523 --> 07:18.039
Nope. Just the one. Rach!

07:23.891 --> 07:25.565
No!

07:25.813 --> 07:28.488
Okay, maybe if we just break it down.

07:28.656 --> 07:33.655
Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.

07:37.384 --> 07:38.978
Great! Okay, faster.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.434
- Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
- What are you doing?

07:49.597 --> 07:52.193
I have to go before I put your head
through a wall.

07:52.439 --> 07:56.072
Don't go, I need you!
My audition is tomorrow!

08:11.739 --> 08:13.936
Hey. I was gonna
make us some dinner...

08:14.101 --> 08:17.939
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.

08:18.586 --> 08:20.863
I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.

08:21.468 --> 08:24.110
- Did you call your parents?
- Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.

08:24.311 --> 08:25.712
Oh, good.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.115
- What?
- I just can't believe...

08:30.277 --> 08:32.510
...I'm in Rachel Green's room.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.155
- You've been in my room before.
- Yeah, sure, right.

08:38.526 --> 08:40.519
Like I'd ever be
in Rachel Green's room.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.001
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.

08:44.451 --> 08:45.772
Sorry.

08:47.454 --> 08:49.652
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:49.857 --> 08:51.496
- Yeah, you had a rough day.
- Yeah.

08:51.659 --> 08:55.861
It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.

08:56.023 --> 08:58.824
You don't expect doctors to get sick.

08:59.026 --> 09:00.859
But we do.

09:04.952 --> 09:06.626
He's gonna be okay, Rach.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.839
I don't want him to wake up alone.
I should go to the hospital.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.761
- What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
- What?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.597
They gave him a lot of medication.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.564
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.805
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.

09:21.969 --> 09:24.360
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No... God, hey.

09:24.572 --> 09:26.565
Rach, you've been an
amazing daughter, okay?

09:26.734 --> 09:30.777
- Right now you need to get some rest.
- Okay, maybe you're right.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.612
Good night.

09:34.261 --> 09:36.174
Wait, wait, wait.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.705
Would you stay here with me
for a little while?

09:40.708 --> 09:43.019
- Sure.
- Okay.

09:43.871 --> 09:47.469
- Thank you for coming with me today.
- Oh, of course.

09:47.675 --> 09:50.750
Rachel Green is very happy
you're in her room.

09:51.919 --> 09:54.276
Me too. Come here.

09:55.723 --> 09:58.718
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.

09:59.006 --> 10:03.687
Okay, well, I can maybe grab
a sleeping bag or...

10:18.145 --> 10:20.297
No, Rach!

10:20.828 --> 10:24.541
I'm sorry, I just don't
think this is a good idea.

10:24.752 --> 10:27.633
Well, we won't know that
until we do it, will we?

10:27.955 --> 10:29.469
Look...

10:29.797 --> 10:34.158
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...

10:34.321 --> 10:36.234
...and I just don't feel
it would be right.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.000
I feel like I'd be, you know,
taking advantage of you.

10:39.206 --> 10:43.203
What...? Taking advantage? I am giving
you the advantage. Enjoy!

10:44.411 --> 10:46.483
Look, I'm sure it would be great...

10:46.654 --> 10:49.808
...but I think one of us
has to be thinking clearly.

10:49.977 --> 10:52.413
So I'm gonna go.

10:57.304 --> 10:59.024
Okay.

11:02.309 --> 11:04.222
I'll see you in the morning.

11:07.034 --> 11:10.917
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!

11:16.764 --> 11:19.964
Thanks so much for taking me
to all those places. I had a great time.

11:20.127 --> 11:22.849
I'm glad. Listen, I wanna apologize
about Chandler, though.

11:23.010 --> 11:27.531
- I just did not see this coming.
- New York is awesome!

11:29.256 --> 11:32.092
- What is with you?
- I've been to these places before...

11:32.259 --> 11:33.933
...but I've never really seen them.

11:34.141 --> 11:36.099
Yeah, you miss a lot
when you're mooing.

11:37.745 --> 11:40.820
- Thank you for showing me around.
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

11:40.988 --> 11:43.265
We're so much enjoying
getting to know you.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.583
Well, if there's anything else
you wanna know...

11:48.716 --> 11:50.389
Okay.

11:51.158 --> 11:53.276
Can we ask you some
questions about the father?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.559
Oh, sure. Yeah.

11:56.203 --> 11:59.995
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.

12:00.728 --> 12:03.962
- Got a scholarship and went to college.
- That's great.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.367
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

12:10.057 --> 12:11.377
How's that, now?

12:11.899 --> 12:14.495
Well, there's a chance
it's another guy.

12:14.662 --> 12:18.101
I mean, I've only ever been
with two guys...

12:18.265 --> 12:20.543
...but they sort of overlapped.

12:21.268 --> 12:22.703
So, what does the other guy do?

12:22.870 --> 12:26.229
- Does he go to college too?
- No, he's in prison.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.917
Was he falsely accused of something?

12:32.640 --> 12:33.960
No.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.318
He killed his father with a shovel.

12:38.445 --> 12:40.039
Other than that, he's a great guy.

12:40.327 --> 12:43.083
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

12:51.699 --> 12:53.817
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.862
Assume from now on
that I'm always awake.

12:58.225 --> 13:01.744
All right, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.

13:01.909 --> 13:05.542
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.

13:09.396 --> 13:11.309
Well, all right,
let's say that it is him.

13:11.519 --> 13:12.999
Would we not want the baby? No.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.473
- Would we treat him any differently?
- I'd keep an eye on him.

13:19.086 --> 13:20.999
We have to find out
who the father is.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.882
- How?
- I don't know.

13:23.090 --> 13:26.973
- They have tests for these things, right?
- Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.

13:27.134 --> 13:30.447
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.652
He probably loves his mommy.

13:32.820 --> 13:36.293
He's probably got a tattoo that says
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.

13:41.589 --> 13:44.105
We'll now count from one to five.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.804
- Good job.
- Thank you.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.765
- Hey.
- Hey, Joey.

13:59.927 --> 14:03.526
Listen, I feel really badly about
yesterday, and I thought about it a lot.

14:03.691 --> 14:07.004
No, I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.854
That's okay. I don't need your help.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.852
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say I am pretty good.

14:12.740 --> 14:16.418
- Really, can I hear some of it?
- Sure, sure.

14:17.184 --> 14:18.778
Okay.

14:26.113 --> 14:27.753
See?

14:28.435 --> 14:30.473
You, you're not...

14:30.838 --> 14:32.238
You're not... You're...

14:32.399 --> 14:35.394
Again, you're not speaking French!

14:37.244 --> 14:40.923
Oh, well, I think I am! Yeah, and I think
I'm definitely gonna get the part!

14:41.128 --> 14:43.086
How could you possibly think that?

14:43.290 --> 14:45.853
The guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!

14:49.937 --> 14:52.579
Hey, Rach, can you grab me
a cup of coffee?

14:54.542 --> 14:56.101
Sure.

14:57.665 --> 15:00.740
You've been quiet all morning.
Is everything okay?

15:03.110 --> 15:05.262
- You sure you're all right?
- Yep.

15:06.313 --> 15:07.589
Okay.

15:07.755 --> 15:10.191
Well, I'm gonna go
grab us some breakfast.

15:10.397 --> 15:13.073
- FYI.
- There it is.

15:14.241 --> 15:20.801
In the future, when a girl asks for some
ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.

15:21.769 --> 15:25.766
Wait, wait, you're mad at me
about last night?

15:25.933 --> 15:28.575
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- Really?

15:28.736 --> 15:30.329
If you had done the right thing...

15:30.497 --> 15:33.298
...I wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.820
I would've woken up feeling
comforted and satisfied.

15:38.706 --> 15:41.063
- Well...
- Oh, stop that!

15:41.909 --> 15:44.665
I can't believe this!
I was just being a good guy.

15:44.832 --> 15:47.394
I treated you with
respect and understanding.

15:47.595 --> 15:48.995
Oh, that is so hot.

15:50.037 --> 15:51.757
Hey, I was looking out for you.

15:51.919 --> 15:54.151
Oh, really? Well, you know what?
I am a big girl.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.963
I don't need someone telling me
what is best for me.

15:57.765 --> 16:02.445
I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot
of times before. This is the worst ever!

16:02.890 --> 16:05.930
Oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.

16:06.373 --> 16:08.286
Okay, you know...?
Hey, hey, you know what?

16:08.455 --> 16:10.368
To avoid this little thing
in the future...

16:10.578 --> 16:13.048
...let's just say you and me?
Never having sex again.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.618
- What?
- That's right! Sex is off the table!

16:15.783 --> 16:19.575
I am never having sex with you again!

16:25.272 --> 16:27.743
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

16:30.277 --> 16:33.352
- Hey! How was lunch?
- We had a good time.

16:33.561 --> 16:36.282
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

16:36.483 --> 16:39.559
It would really mean a lot to me
if the baby was a boy...

16:39.727 --> 16:41.640
...that you name him after my father...

16:41.809 --> 16:43.961
...Jiminy Billy Bob.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.176
- Oh, really?
- No!

16:51.338 --> 16:53.650
You were right. That was fun.

16:55.663 --> 16:57.382
I'm gonna go finish packing.

17:01.348 --> 17:04.184
- So is she gonna take the test?
- No, she doesn't have to.

17:04.351 --> 17:06.709
- I found out who the father is.
- Oh, God.

17:06.914 --> 17:09.590
- It's Shovely Joe, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

17:09.757 --> 17:11.032
How do you know?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.475
Erica didn't pay attention
in sex ed class...

17:13.641 --> 17:16.032
...because the things she did
with that prison guy?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.196
It'd be pretty hard to make
a baby that way.

17:18.405 --> 17:22.642
Oh, God, what was it? The thing we
hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?

17:24.732 --> 17:26.371
The thing we never do.

17:27.454 --> 17:29.766
Shovely Joe.

17:38.906 --> 17:41.376
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right.

17:49.557 --> 17:54.032
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Dude, come on, French it up.

17:55.002 --> 17:57.040
Joey, do you speak French?

18:03.931 --> 18:06.003
You know what?
I think this audition is over.

18:07.815 --> 18:09.488
Excuse me?

18:09.697 --> 18:12.612
I am Regine Phalange.

18:14.421 --> 18:17.542
I was passing by when
I heard this man speaking...

18:17.705 --> 18:23.502
...the regional dialect of my
French town of Estee Lauder.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.350
You really think this man
is speaking French?

18:55.903 --> 18:58.373
Good job, little buddy.

19:01.388 --> 19:03.028
That was some really good French.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.832
But I think we're gonna go
with someone else for the part.

19:06.714 --> 19:09.754
- All right, but my French was good?
- It was great.

19:09.917 --> 19:10.907
See?

19:20.728 --> 19:23.449
- Emma's down for the night.
- Oh, good.

19:23.611 --> 19:27.323
- So I guess I'm gonna take off.
- Okay.

19:27.494 --> 19:30.091
Hey, listen, just before you go...

19:30.297 --> 19:32.415
I just wanna say thank you
for coming with me.

19:32.620 --> 19:33.974
Oh, no problem.

19:35.142 --> 19:37.021
And also, you know, I...

19:37.184 --> 19:41.740
I was thinking about what you said,
you know, about the whole sex thing...

19:41.909 --> 19:45.461
Probably not a great idea
to go down that road again.

19:45.673 --> 19:48.634
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

19:48.836 --> 19:51.797
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.475
Yeah.

19:54.642 --> 19:56.953
Yeah, that's true.

19:57.324 --> 20:00.080
Hey, do you remember
that one really great time?

20:00.247 --> 20:01.967
- Oh, yeah!
- You know?

20:02.129 --> 20:05.283
- It was Valentine's Day.
- It was your birthday.

20:06.213 --> 20:08.650
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

20:11.779 --> 20:15.856
Well, I guess that's all
in the past now.

20:20.588 --> 20:23.423
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.

20:23.911 --> 20:27.065
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it...

20:27.234 --> 20:30.274
...really bad.
- That's what we decided.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.111
Right.

20:34.802 --> 20:37.443
- It's kind of hard, though. You know?
- Yeah.

20:37.605 --> 20:41.807
When two people have a connection,
you know, that's...

20:42.089 --> 20:44.207
Just seems like...

20:44.371 --> 20:45.806
...such a...

20:45.973 --> 20:47.931
...waste.

20:50.978 --> 20:52.332
I hate waste.

20:57.545 --> 21:00.107
- Ross?
- Yes?

21:00.307 --> 21:01.981
Just so you know...

21:02.870 --> 21:04.703
...with us...

21:04.992 --> 21:07.509
...it's never off the table.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.719
Damn it, it's never off the table.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.571
- Okay, can you really tap-dance?
- No.

21:31.779 --> 21:33.692
It's off the resume.

21:34.421 --> 21:36.733
- Archery?
- No.

21:36.944 --> 21:40.303
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.

21:41.709 --> 21:43.941
You can drink a gallon of milk
in 10 seconds?

21:44.151 --> 21:45.711
That I can do.

21:46.033 --> 21:49.472
Come on, you can drink
a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

21:49.677 --> 21:51.556
All right, watch me.

21:53.400 --> 21:58.001
- Okay, you time me, ready?
- Ready, go!

22:26.674 --> 22:27.949
You did it!

22:31.438 --> 22:33.431
