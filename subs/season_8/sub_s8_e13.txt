WEBVTT

00:05.872 --> 00:09.467
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?

00:09.709 --> 00:15.306
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.

00:15.548 --> 00:19.951
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"

00:22.522 --> 00:26.982
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.

00:27.227 --> 00:32.859
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

00:33.700 --> 00:39.138
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

01:23.917 --> 01:26.078
Are you..? Are you high?

01:27.220 --> 01:29.415
I just had the most amazing bath.

01:29.656 --> 01:33.023
-Really? I don't like baths.
-You like them with me.

01:33.293 --> 01:36.558
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

01:38.064 --> 01:42.091
-Baths are so relaxing.
-Really? What do you do?

01:42.335 --> 01:45.668
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.908
How dirty do you think I am?

01:50.176 --> 01:54.738
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you would love it.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.075
It would take all of your stress away.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.785
It's 2:00 on a Wednesday
and I'm watching Road Rules.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.183
How stressed do you think I am?

02:05.191 --> 02:09.093
Hey, Chandler. You got a minute?
I really need to talk to you.

02:09.462 --> 02:13.728
Oh, yeah. Is this a cold-pizza talk
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

02:13.900 --> 02:15.128
Well, neither.

02:16.102 --> 02:18.468
Oh, my God, what's up?

02:19.672 --> 02:22.163
I don't know. It's just..

02:22.575 --> 02:25.703
Lately, I've been feeling..

02:26.846 --> 02:29.280
Okay, here's what it is.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.118
You know what?
I feel a lot better. Thanks.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.588
No. Come back here and talk to me,
mon frere.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.087
-Who?
-Just come back.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.486
Okay.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.026
You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

02:49.269 --> 02:53.763
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.909
But that's different. There are rules
there too, you know what I mean?

02:58.645 --> 03:00.112
Do you?

03:03.049 --> 03:07.884
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place, right?

03:08.054 --> 03:09.282
-In London?
-Yeah.

03:09.455 --> 03:13.016
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

03:13.459 --> 03:16.553
You know what. This is a bad idea.
Forget all about it.

03:16.796 --> 03:20.027
And listen, do me a favor,
this conversation between you and me.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.801
If that.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.535
How do I keep losing at tic-tac-toe?

03:31.711 --> 03:34.646
Oh, no, no, honey.
My circle always stays in the middle.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.183
Oh, Ross, don't forget we have
that doctor's appointment tomorrow.

03:40.353 --> 03:43.550
-To find out the sex of the baby?
-No. We don't wanna know.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.123
All we care about
is that it's happy and healthy.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.590
Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.

03:48.761 --> 03:51.559
-And smart. With an aptitude for science.
-Popular.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.789
Are you two talking
about the same baby?

03:55.902 --> 03:59.998
-Hey, have you thought of names?
-Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.231
-Really? Me too.
-Me too.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.639
Really?

04:04.877 --> 04:09.780
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

04:11.951 --> 04:16.650
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.118
-Rach, what were you thinking?
-Okay.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.292
I was thinking if it's a girl..

04:22.528 --> 04:26.897
how about Sandrene? It's French.

04:27.133 --> 04:31.331
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.974
-Okay, fine. What do you have?
-It's for a boy.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.577
I know it's a little out there, but..

04:41.914 --> 04:43.541
Darwin.

04:44.917 --> 04:48.409
Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten
to death in the schoolyard.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.486
Yeah, by Sandrene.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.155
You're saying that
because I said no to your name.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.624
I'm really, really not.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.263
How about you each get five vetoes?

04:59.465 --> 05:03.834
-That sounds fair.
-I don't think you'll need it. Check this out.

05:04.103 --> 05:07.504
If it's a girl, Rain.

05:08.374 --> 05:11.571
-Veto.
-Why?

05:11.811 --> 05:15.178
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

05:15.448 --> 05:20.044
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

05:21.587 --> 05:23.817
I know her!

05:24.090 --> 05:26.615
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

05:29.095 --> 05:34.795
-Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
-Why do you hate our child?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.970
-Fine, you go.
-Okay. James.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.604
-But only if it's a girl.
-Veto.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.332
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

05:44.544 --> 05:47.707
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

05:50.116 --> 05:52.744
-How about Dayton?
-Veto. Stewart.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.612
Veto. Sawyer.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.153
-Veto. Helen.
-Veto.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.459
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

06:06.366 --> 06:09.028
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.135
Sex on the balcony?

06:11.337 --> 06:14.795
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

06:15.641 --> 06:17.768
-What is it?
-I drew you a bath.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.912
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of us having sex on the balcony?

06:23.082 --> 06:25.949
Please. Will you just try it for me.
I used all my best stuff.

06:26.219 --> 06:31.521
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

06:31.758 --> 06:36.957
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

06:38.164 --> 06:43.363
-This does butch it up a bit.
-I swear, if you try it, you will love it.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.663
If I do this, can we at least discuss
sex on the balcony?

06:46.873 --> 06:48.170
Absolutely.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.377
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

07:01.220 --> 07:07.455
All right, this isn't so bad.
I like the flowery smell.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.322
Which is okay,
because I've got my boat.

07:12.999 --> 07:17.265
I can actually feel my tension
just melting away.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.530
I could fall asleep in here.

07:19.705 --> 07:22.105
I could drown in here.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.769
Drowning.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.608
-So?
-Oh, my God.

07:31.851 --> 07:36.345
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.520
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

07:48.868 --> 07:52.099
I don't think you had an open mind
about the name Ruth.

07:52.271 --> 07:55.570
I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller?
How cute is that?

07:55.775 --> 07:59.973
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

08:01.147 --> 08:06.608
Okay. All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in knowing the sex of the baby?

08:06.819 --> 08:10.846
-No, we're not.
-But you have it right there in that file?

08:11.123 --> 08:13.250
You could tell us
whether it's a boy or a girl?

08:13.426 --> 08:16.827
Dayton or Sandrene?
Phoebe or Pheebo?

08:17.029 --> 08:19.497
That's right.
But if you don't wanna know..

08:19.665 --> 08:23.465
-No, we wanna wait. Right?
-Right. Right.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.865
Oh, I'll be right back.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.169
I know it's really not my place..

08:30.376 --> 08:33.834
but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

08:38.718 --> 08:42.210
So which of these babies
do you think is the ugliest?

08:42.488 --> 08:45.389
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.492
They're babies.
They're all beautiful.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.130
-Third one from the left?
-Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

08:52.999 --> 08:59.199
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you..? You're looking!

08:59.405 --> 09:00.872
-I didn't!
-I saw you!

09:01.073 --> 09:03.598
Fine, I did,
but I didn't see anything.

09:03.776 --> 09:07.371
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

09:07.880 --> 09:12.078
-Okay. But listen to me, I didn't..
-Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

09:12.418 --> 09:14.852
I couldn't even if I wanted to,
because I don't know!

09:15.021 --> 09:19.924
I swear I didn't see anything! I don't want
to know. It was just a momentary lapse.

09:20.092 --> 09:23.289
Momentary lapse?
Don't you have any self-control?

09:23.529 --> 09:26.862
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.771
Hello?

09:32.972 --> 09:36.965
I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
I think there's something wrong.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.269
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.237
I'm in the bathtub.

09:47.219 --> 09:50.450
-What's wrong?
-I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.

09:50.623 --> 09:55.356
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
and is now lodged places.

09:56.562 --> 10:01.499
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?

10:02.568 --> 10:05.230
-What?
-Bath salts.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.802
They're starting to effervesce.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.409
It's different.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.569
It's interesting.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.743
Okay. Let's talk about something else.

10:16.916 --> 10:20.818
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

10:22.622 --> 10:26.353
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.118
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

10:30.329 --> 10:34.425
-I had the same conversation.
-You did? What was he talking about?

10:34.634 --> 10:39.071
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since we saw him in Macbeth.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.501
That was a long night.

10:43.909 --> 10:47.037
All right, let's break this down.
What exactly did he say to you?

10:47.279 --> 10:52.342
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.882
-He didn't say that to me.
-What'd he tell you?

10:55.121 --> 10:58.181
He was asking questions
about you, me and London.

10:58.457 --> 11:01.893
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

11:02.828 --> 11:06.764
Okay. So you, me and London.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.229
Looking at people differently.

11:09.902 --> 11:13.599
Maybe he wants to do what you and I
did in London with someone.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.138
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

11:16.308 --> 11:20.142
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

11:20.379 --> 11:24.509
-Because he was looking at her differently.
-And Phoebe is his friend.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.845
So he thinks that would be
breaking the rules.

11:27.053 --> 11:30.318
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

11:30.823 --> 11:33.815
-You guys?
-Just a minute!

11:34.193 --> 11:38.357
-That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
-You don't say anything.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.565
Why would I say anything?

11:40.733 --> 11:44.294
That two of our friends could start
the greatest love affair of their lives?

11:44.470 --> 11:48.167
They would have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

11:49.275 --> 11:52.540
-I'm not gonna let you say anything.
-You just stay here.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.905
Oh, God!

11:58.951 --> 12:00.851
Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.581
Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.918
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.594
-What?
-Nothing.

12:16.902 --> 12:20.736
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.235
Fine.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.140
It's a humdinger.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.306
Well, then it's really too bad
that you can't tell me.

12:28.514 --> 12:29.879
Somebody likes you!

12:34.120 --> 12:35.553
Is it Chandler?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.914
-No!
-Then tell him to stop staring.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.188
It's Joey.

12:42.995 --> 12:47.091
Really? Joey? You don't say.

12:47.299 --> 12:51.668
-Is it something you'd be interested in?
-I don't know, I don't know.

12:52.471 --> 12:56.032
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

12:57.977 --> 13:01.140
But, you know, on the other hand..

13:02.148 --> 13:05.777
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.680
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

13:08.921 --> 13:14.154
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

13:14.360 --> 13:18.319
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

13:19.331 --> 13:22.926
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

13:24.170 --> 13:28.004
-Not Chandler. Just Joey.
-Sure.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.211
You know what? I've been thinking about it.
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.115
I think I would actually consider
naming our child that.

13:42.822 --> 13:47.156
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.187
Wait a minute.

13:52.798 --> 13:58.703
Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

13:58.971 --> 14:02.634
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.708
You did see. You know it's a boy!

14:05.978 --> 14:09.209
I didn't see anything.
I actually changed my mind about the name.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.315
I don't think so.
You're giving me Ruth..

14:12.585 --> 14:15.782
so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

14:16.021 --> 14:21.891
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.391
I would.. Sequoia!

14:24.630 --> 14:27.622
-Veto.
-Fine.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.461
Unless..

14:33.239 --> 14:36.731
you anticipated
that I would figure all this out..

14:36.976 --> 14:40.343
and you know that
it actually is a girl.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.038
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

14:44.250 --> 14:49.916
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

14:50.189 --> 14:55.058
-But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
-Not like this!

14:59.865 --> 15:01.332
What's up?

15:01.634 --> 15:05.695
-Joey, I know.
-What?

15:07.139 --> 15:10.802
-I know.
-What?

15:11.911 --> 15:16.143
-I know about your feelings.
-Oh, my God, you do?

15:16.348 --> 15:21.547
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

15:21.787 --> 15:26.952
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for those guys.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.626
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.795
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

15:35.734 --> 15:40.194
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.203
She's my pregnant friend
who's Ross 'ex!

15:43.442 --> 15:45.569
Yeah, that's Rachel.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.505
Beat me over the head with it.

15:50.049 --> 15:54.679
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

15:54.887 --> 15:58.687
I stayed up all last night and made a list
of everything I don't like about her.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.722
-You wanna hear it?
-Yeah.

16:03.896 --> 16:09.266
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

16:09.468 --> 16:12.835
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

16:14.506 --> 16:18.636
Joey, I think you're getting upset for
nothing. This is probably just a crush.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.306
You think?

16:20.479 --> 16:24.415
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but then it goes away.

16:24.616 --> 16:29.110
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

16:29.355 --> 16:32.222
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.325
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

16:35.594 --> 16:39.155
I know I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

16:40.966 --> 16:44.959
-And I'm sure you've had them for us.
-Not really.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.367
Throw me a bone here.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.776
So I called the doctor.

17:01.353 --> 17:05.517
-Now we both know the sex of the baby.
-What?

17:05.758 --> 17:09.854
That's right.
The student has become the master.

17:10.329 --> 17:16.029
-Ross, I swear. I don't know.
-Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

17:16.235 --> 17:17.702
A what?

17:19.071 --> 17:20.299
You really didn't know?

17:20.472 --> 17:22.997
-We're having a girl?
-No.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.106
-That's what you said.
-No.

17:25.344 --> 17:29.440
-You said girl.
-Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.014
I'm not! We're having a girl!

17:32.284 --> 17:37.221
Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,
but still, we're having a girl!

17:37.823 --> 17:42.817
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

17:43.028 --> 17:46.327
Yes, we'll have ourselves
a little baby Ruth.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.304
-Permission to veto.
-Yes, please.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.873
Do I smell essential oils?

18:03.082 --> 18:06.574
Yeah. I'm gonna take a bath.
I was just gonna get a magazine.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.235
What do you think you're doing?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.504
Leaving my troubles behind?

18:29.475 --> 18:33.775
I know that you're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

18:34.012 --> 18:37.641
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.881
Okay, fine. You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.152
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.685
Hi, bubbles. Manly.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.758
I thought I would drop by
and let you know how it went.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.797
You told her?

18:56.235 --> 19:00.569
She pulled it out of me!
She's like a conversational wizard!

19:00.739 --> 19:04.641
-How did it go?
-You were wrong. He doesn't like me.

19:04.843 --> 19:08.142
How would you like it if I sent you
to Lee Majors' house..

19:08.313 --> 19:10.440
and I told you he liked you
and you went there..

19:10.616 --> 19:13.744
and you found out that he didn't like you.
How would you feel?

19:16.922 --> 19:20.358
-I don't think I'd care.
-Really? Lee Majors is hot.

19:22.227 --> 19:26.220
-Hello?
-We're in the bathroom!

19:26.732 --> 19:30.793
-Why?
-Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

19:33.305 --> 19:36.968
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Oh, my God.

19:37.209 --> 19:41.805
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.447
-It's Rachel!
-You like Rachel?

19:44.650 --> 19:49.519
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.780
Dude, you gotta rearrange
your bubbles.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.990
Mazel tov.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.993
Ross and I were looking for you.

20:02.234 --> 20:06.500
What are we all doing in here?
Oh, my.

20:08.207 --> 20:13.235
-Honey, cover it up with the boat.
-It's not an aircraft carrier.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.941
Hello?

20:16.148 --> 20:20.084
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

20:21.987 --> 20:28.017
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.759
-Did you tell them?
-No. I was waiting for you.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.490
-Tell us what?
-We're having a girl.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.259
Oh, wow! Really?

20:41.873 --> 20:43.306
I'll get you later.

20:50.315 --> 20:54.308
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.248
That's all. Just a little crush.

20:57.489 --> 21:01.289
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.462
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"

21:09.601 --> 21:13.128
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's just a crush.

21:14.906 --> 21:18.706
-Hi, sweetie.
-I love you.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.813
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

21:30.222 --> 21:33.658
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.850
I'm not touching you.

21:36.995 --> 21:39.361
-You're not?
-It's the salts.

21:39.531 --> 21:42.932
Oh, sweet Lord,
new realms of pleasure.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.494
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
