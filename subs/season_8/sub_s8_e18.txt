WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:05.937
Is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary?

00:06.172 --> 00:07.196
-Sure.
-Yeah.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.672
-Who's the guy?
-Parker, we met at the cleaners.

00:11.277 --> 00:15.043
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.674
Who said that?

00:19.019 --> 00:23.956
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

00:24.224 --> 00:29.958
He treats me like a queen. Except
when he treats me like a naughty girl.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.064
Would it be okay if I give the toast?

00:34.434 --> 00:37.198
Even after what happened
at their 20th?

00:37.404 --> 00:41.932
-I'd really like to.
-Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

00:42.175 --> 00:47.545
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

00:47.747 --> 00:53.413
-This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
-You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

00:53.620 --> 00:58.751
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone
cries and pats him on the back.

00:58.992 --> 01:03.691
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

01:03.930 --> 01:08.264
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

01:09.803 --> 01:12.772
Well, at least one
person will be crying.

01:12.939 --> 01:17.205
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

01:17.410 --> 01:21.471
-Really? You can do that?
-Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

01:31.357 --> 01:34.815
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me!

02:17.003 --> 02:18.766
Hey.

02:18.938 --> 02:21.463
Oh, my God.
You look so fantastic.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.870
On my way over,
I pictured you in my mind's eye.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.706
Now I'm like,
"Mind's eye, you had no idea!"

02:32.352 --> 02:34.149
-Let's do that again!
-Okay.

02:40.927 --> 02:44.294
-What are you doing?
-I'm working on my toast.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.989
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

02:49.669 --> 02:51.534
I cannot wait to see them cry.

02:51.704 --> 02:56.004
It's not gonna be like regular crying. It's
gonna be like Terms of Endearment crying.

02:56.576 --> 03:01.536
I'm gonna reduce my parents
to sniffling, quaking masses of..

03:02.649 --> 03:05.117
I may have some unresolved anger
from my childhood.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.481
-Hey, check this out.
-It's a dog.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.248
It's a dead dog.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.426
Chi-Chi. She died
when I was in high school.

03:14.627 --> 03:18.529
-You're talking about a dead pet?
-It's good stuff, huh?

03:22.502 --> 03:25.562
Joey? You got a present
for my parents?

03:25.772 --> 03:30.573
In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

03:30.810 --> 03:37.010
-That is so cool.
-And I got Kama Sutra for the Elderly.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.618
You know, I think maybe
the one present is enough.

03:46.326 --> 03:49.159
-Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
-Sure.

03:49.362 --> 03:55.892
What do you need? We got lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt..

03:56.669 --> 03:59.570
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

04:02.976 --> 04:07.845
Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.

04:08.047 --> 04:12.643
Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

04:13.820 --> 04:18.883
-What?
-You're the 200-pounder who rode her!

04:22.395 --> 04:26.058
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is..

04:26.332 --> 04:31.269
No, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel..

04:31.504 --> 04:35.235
and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

04:35.842 --> 04:39.278
Chandler, I'm kidding!
Already you're my favorite.

04:39.512 --> 04:44.415
-Tell me a little about yourselves.
-Actually, we should get going.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.785
Classic Ross!

04:50.423 --> 04:53.915
Rachel, look how you glow! May I?

04:54.527 --> 04:56.495
I think you already are.

04:56.696 --> 05:00.132
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

05:00.566 --> 05:06.027
Is there anything more miraculous..
A picture of a dog! Whose is this?

05:07.707 --> 05:10.767
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

05:11.010 --> 05:17.074
Well, at least you were lucky to have
him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.086
You guys, we really should get going.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.519
There I go again, my catch phrase.

05:24.691 --> 05:28.058
-So where's the party?
-It's in Massapequa.

05:28.328 --> 05:33.994
Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it
steeped in Native American history?

05:34.200 --> 05:37.727
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.666
I've got my notes. You got the presents?

05:40.907 --> 05:44.900
-I've got the car keys.
-We're driving? Aces.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.844
-So he seems like a nice guy.
-Yeah, I like him a lot.

05:52.085 --> 05:57.022
-You want to hang back and take a cab?
-Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.898
-Hey, Mom.
-This is such a great party!

06:09.302 --> 06:14.239
Thirty-five years. Impressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?

06:14.741 --> 06:19.542
-Jack?
-Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

06:19.746 --> 06:23.273
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

06:25.017 --> 06:29.386
-Congratulations, you two.
-Thank you, we're so excited.

06:29.589 --> 06:33.286
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

06:34.227 --> 06:38.095
-Can we talk to you for just a moment?
-Yeah.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.394
It's just a little thing.

06:41.601 --> 06:47.471
While we think it's marvelous you're
having this baby out of wedlock..

06:48.074 --> 06:50.941
our friends are less open-minded.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.737
-We told them you're married.
-What?

06:53.946 --> 06:56.437
Thanks for going along with this.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.953
-We have to pretend that we're married?
-I had to shave my ears.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.452
You can do this.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.318
-Can you believe that?
-I know.

07:07.593 --> 07:11.927
If you do the ears, you may as well
take a pass at the nose.

07:12.131 --> 07:15.430
I don't want to have to lie
about being married.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.571
I don't either. But it's their party,
and it's one night.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.332
We don't have to lie.
We won't talk.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.874
If it comes up,
we'll smile, we'll nod along..

07:26.112 --> 07:27.136
-Ross?
-Rachel?

07:27.346 --> 07:30.645
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

07:30.850 --> 07:35.787
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

07:37.190 --> 07:41.650
-Here's something to start you out.
-How's marriage treating you?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.458
-Unbelievable. It's great!
-We love marriage.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.098
We'll see you later.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.495
-Hey!
-Hi!

07:50.002 --> 07:53.494
Can I just say, Monica,
that your driving is exquisite.

07:53.906 --> 07:57.103
Thanks. Like I said before,
I pretty much just stayed in the lines..

07:57.276 --> 07:58.800
and tried not to hit anybody.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.472
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

08:03.716 --> 08:09.120
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C..

08:09.989 --> 08:14.358
I feel so lucky. Think of the good
times that happened here.

08:14.527 --> 08:19.658
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

08:20.666 --> 08:24.796
None will compare with tonight.
I don't want to forget it.

08:25.004 --> 08:30.271
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

08:31.043 --> 08:34.137
I don't think the flash went off.

08:37.550 --> 08:40.110
-I'm gonna find the men's room.
-I'll go with you.

08:40.286 --> 08:42.777
Somewhere there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun..

08:42.955 --> 08:45.651
and a huge butterfly net looking
for that man.

08:47.193 --> 08:52.028
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.063
Glad we weren't in the car.
Did he let up?

08:55.301 --> 08:59.567
He called the Long lsland
Expressway a "concrete miracle."

09:00.139 --> 09:03.040
This room. This night.

09:03.309 --> 09:09.214
That waiter! His shoes!
I must take a mental picture!

09:09.482 --> 09:11.040
Sorry.

09:14.687 --> 09:18.145
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.883
That depends, how much did you hear?

09:22.995 --> 09:26.692
He's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

09:26.866 --> 09:29.858
-It's so much.
-Well, so what? I like him.

09:30.069 --> 09:34.233
Do I make fun of the people you date?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

09:34.507 --> 09:38.841
No, because friends don't do that.
Do you want my opinion?

09:39.011 --> 09:45.507
Your collective dating record reads
like a who's who of human crap!

09:47.019 --> 09:50.318
-I feel terrible.
-I know.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.324
What was wrong with Mona?

09:57.496 --> 10:00.158
-Open it, open it, open it.
-Yeah, baby!

10:00.366 --> 10:04.234
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

10:04.437 --> 10:10.535
-We were surprised we weren't invited.
-No, it was a small wedding.

10:10.710 --> 10:15.443
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

10:15.648 --> 10:20.449
-Where did you have it?
-On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

10:20.720 --> 10:25.919
And Stevie Wonder sang " lsn't She
Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.118
-Stevie's a family friend.
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.

10:30.396 --> 10:34.162
-I'd love to see pictures.
-Yeah, so would I.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.929
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.764
Would you excuse us for a second?

10:47.680 --> 10:52.845
-What are you doing?
-What? This may be my only wedding.

10:53.753 --> 10:57.484
-And I want it to be amazing.
-Okay.

10:57.757 --> 11:02.091
-Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
-Ross, it has to be realistic.

11:07.133 --> 11:11.263
Say, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

11:11.470 --> 11:17.170
-No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
-And I'm with you. What a great time!

11:18.678 --> 11:21.647
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

11:22.682 --> 11:27.085
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.953
Oysters! Let me feed you.
That's not necessary.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.647
-Please?
-I don't eat..

11:32.858 --> 11:36.225
-I won't quit until you try one.
-Okay, fine.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.959
-Good.
-What're they like? I've never had one.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.301
-Try one.
-They look too weird.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.240
I know, I know.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.640
Listen, your family is really
starting to warm up to me.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.011
You just kissed the caterer.

12:00.853 --> 12:05.552
-What are you doing?
-Going over my toast.

12:05.791 --> 12:10.922
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

12:11.297 --> 12:15.791
If you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just..

12:16.869 --> 12:21.932
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

12:22.174 --> 12:25.610
-Blind?
-Not at first, but it's intricate work.

12:25.878 --> 12:30.110
They said even though they lost
their sight, it was worth it.

12:30.549 --> 12:33.916
-I bet you looked beautiful.
-Well, I don't know.

12:34.186 --> 12:39.123
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

12:39.558 --> 12:44.188
-How did you propose?
-Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

12:45.264 --> 12:49.462
Well, actually, I took her
to the planetarium.

12:49.869 --> 12:53.532
That's where we had our first date.

12:53.939 --> 12:58.467
I had the room filled with lilies,
her favorite flower.

12:59.145 --> 13:02.911
-That is so sweet!
-I want to hear the rest!

13:04.450 --> 13:09.387
Then Fred Astaire singing,
"The Way You Look Tonight" came on..

13:09.588 --> 13:12.557
the lights came down,
I got on one knee..

13:12.792 --> 13:17.126
and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

13:17.396 --> 13:19.990
"Will you marry me?"

13:20.933 --> 13:24.960
And the ring was the size of my fist.

13:26.372 --> 13:29.603
Hey, Phoebe? Look..

13:31.143 --> 13:34.806
I want to apologize. Okay?
We were being jerks.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.107
-Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.
-You better do it now.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.786
-Why?
-Because I'm gonna kill him.

13:41.987 --> 13:46.686
-What?
-He's too excited about everything.

13:46.926 --> 13:51.295
I'm all for living, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.523
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.668
I'm having the worst time.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.000
There was a line for the buffet,
and when I got to the plates..

14:01.207 --> 14:04.438
I slipped on a giant booger.

14:06.545 --> 14:09.673
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

14:10.516 --> 14:13.417
It could've been.
I didn't look at it.

14:13.652 --> 14:17.611
I wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.793
I thought he was a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

14:21.994 --> 14:25.430
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.996
There's nothing wrong with him.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.191
-You think?
-Yeah, know what?

14:30.436 --> 14:34.167
-We were all just being too negative.
-You're right.

14:34.440 --> 14:39.468
He's just embracing life. We could
all stand to be more like Parker.

14:39.645 --> 14:43.240
You know what? I'm like him!
I'm a positive person!

14:43.682 --> 14:46.708
-Actually, you have an edge.
-What's that?

14:48.854 --> 14:51.584
-Oh, it's Parker!
-Look, the Bunny Hop!

14:51.857 --> 14:53.484
-Oh, I love it!
-You do?

14:53.692 --> 14:58.391
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on!

15:00.332 --> 15:03.028
Okay, it's time for the toast.

15:03.202 --> 15:08.003
I know normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'll do it.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.902
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.179
Okay.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.748
Mom, Dad, when I got married..

15:20.019 --> 15:26.049
the thing that made me sure I could
do it was the example you two set.

15:26.692 --> 15:30.355
For that, and other things,
I want to thank you.

15:30.562 --> 15:34.521
I know I probably don't
say it enough..

15:35.000 --> 15:37.025
but I love you.

15:47.913 --> 15:54.512
When I look around, I'm saddened by the
thought of those who could not be here.

15:54.820 --> 16:00.156
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.290
But she can't..

16:02.561 --> 16:04.153
because she's dead.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.902
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.930
I mean, look how cute she is.. was.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.104
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

16:21.313 --> 16:26.410
Remember she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.086
Wow!

16:36.962 --> 16:38.862
Does anybody remember when..

16:39.131 --> 16:44.660
Debra Winger had to say goodbye to
her children in Terms of Endearment?

16:46.138 --> 16:47.628
Didn't see that?

16:48.574 --> 16:51.099
No movie fans?!

16:52.878 --> 16:55.005
You want to hear something sad?

16:55.280 --> 16:59.512
I was watching a 60 Minutes
piece on orphans in Romania..

16:59.785 --> 17:04.813
who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.596
You people are made of stone!

17:13.799 --> 17:17.132
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

17:23.475 --> 17:26.967
Thank you, Monica.
That was interesting.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.911
-Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
-Why don't I remember this dog?

17:34.253 --> 17:37.484
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

17:37.689 --> 17:41.557
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

17:41.827 --> 17:46.196
You're not saying anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

17:47.666 --> 17:49.429
No, of course.

17:52.237 --> 17:57.766
Everybody? I just wanted to say..

17:58.043 --> 18:01.206
on behalf of my new bride, Rachel..

18:04.516 --> 18:08.418
and myself, that if..

18:09.154 --> 18:14.592
if in 35 years, we're half
as happy as you guys are..

18:14.860 --> 18:19.058
we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.533
Oh, Ross.

18:24.570 --> 18:29.200
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

18:35.781 --> 18:39.717
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

18:40.686 --> 18:45.749
Can I get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

18:46.058 --> 18:50.256
I must say, this apartment,
it's.. there are no words.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.090
-Thank God.
-It's a haven.

18:53.332 --> 18:58.634
-A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.
-Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.

18:58.837 --> 19:05.265
Listen, why don't we just sit and
relax, just be with each other quietly.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.845
That sounds great.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.583
This is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.719
Let's try something.
Let's play a game.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.719
-I love games.
-Shocking.

19:19.224 --> 19:22.660
Let's play the game of..

19:23.295 --> 19:26.822
who can stay quiet the longest.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.023
Or Jenga.

19:30.235 --> 19:36.640
Let's play this one first, and
remember, whoever talks first loses.

19:40.045 --> 19:44.539
-I lose, now Jenga.
-Oh, my God.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.782
-Is something wrong?
-You know the word "wrong"?

19:48.954 --> 19:51.548
Everything isn't perfect or magical?

19:51.823 --> 19:55.520
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of fairies?

19:55.794 --> 19:58.058
They were just brake lights, Parker!

19:58.230 --> 20:02.291
Excuse me for putting a good spin
on a traffic jam.

20:03.068 --> 20:06.299
You don't have to put
a good spin on everything!

20:06.505 --> 20:11.272
-I'm sorry. I'm a positive person.
-No, I'm a positive person.

20:11.510 --> 20:15.640
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

20:15.914 --> 20:19.509
At Disneyland, getting laid!

20:20.485 --> 20:24.546
You want me to be negative?
You want me to be less happy?

20:24.790 --> 20:26.815
Much less happy.

20:27.192 --> 20:31.151
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

20:33.098 --> 20:35.066
So long!

20:35.434 --> 20:40.599
Don't let the "best door in the world"
hit you in the ass on your way out.

20:44.576 --> 20:49.206
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've had in your life?

20:51.883 --> 20:58.049
We could've gone from the ceremony to
the reception with you in the sidecar.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.122
It just isn't feasible.

21:00.359 --> 21:05.922
But a dove placing the ring on your
finger would've been no problem.

21:07.399 --> 21:12.598
-It was fun being married to you.
-Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.698
-Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

21:17.943 --> 21:22.573
-That proposal at the planetarium?
-I know, I know. It was stupid.

21:22.781 --> 21:28.720
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

21:28.887 --> 21:33.950
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

21:34.760 --> 21:37.422
I thought of it
when we were going out.

21:37.663 --> 21:42.396
That's how I imagined
I would ask you to marry me.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.894
Wow.

21:45.804 --> 21:50.298
Well, that would've been
very hard to say no to.

21:53.278 --> 21:58.739
It's a good thing I didn't do it, it
sounds like a very expensive wedding.

22:04.956 --> 22:08.653
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

22:11.897 --> 22:15.924
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
to protect your hair?

22:16.134 --> 22:19.467
-I will think about it.
-That's all I'm asking.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.038
Okay, that's it. I give up.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.906
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you give the speech.

22:29.114 --> 22:32.845
You know, I don't understand
why they didn't cry.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.145
-Come on.
-That stuff you said about true love?

22:36.421 --> 22:40.915
You were right. We did learn
a lot from Mom and Dad.

22:41.159 --> 22:44.856
That picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

22:45.130 --> 22:51.535
And what you said about Nana? Yeah,
she really would've wanted to be there.

22:52.003 --> 22:54.471
And you know what?

22:55.540 --> 22:57.667
I think she was.

22:59.144 --> 23:02.807
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it?
