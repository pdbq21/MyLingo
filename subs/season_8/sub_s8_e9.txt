WEBVTT

00:08.475 --> 00:11.069
Did you know that during pregnancy..

00:11.311 --> 00:16.578
your fingers swell up to twice
their size and never go back?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.383
Oh, my God! Let me see that.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.683
You fall for it every time.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.550
Hey! I brought you
my old maternity clothes.

00:27.761 --> 00:32.721
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute!

00:32.966 --> 00:37.164
Look. See how they expand
as the baby grows?

00:37.370 --> 00:42.672
And after the baby's born
they're great for shoplifting melons.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.044
Good, you're all here.
Thanksgiving, 4:00.

00:48.248 --> 00:52.685
Guess who I invited? Remember
Will Culvert from high school?

00:53.353 --> 00:55.548
-No.
-He was in Ross' class.

00:55.755 --> 01:00.419
Marching band, was kind of overweight.
Really overweight.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.251
I was his thin friend.

01:04.497 --> 01:08.900
I don't remember. Are you talking
about your imaginary boyfriend?

01:09.102 --> 01:12.071
No, that was Jared.

01:13.206 --> 01:17.074
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.

01:19.312 --> 01:23.772
Will's here on business, and he didn't have
a place to go, so I invited him here.

01:24.017 --> 01:28.386
-That's nice.
-Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.

01:28.588 --> 01:32.080
He looks good.
Okay, I mean really gorgeous.

01:36.629 --> 01:41.259
-I still love Chandler.
-Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.

01:42.802 --> 01:46.238
Just so you know,
I'm not gonna make a turkey this year..

01:46.840 --> 01:49.138
-What?
-Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

01:49.342 --> 01:53.779
-Phoebe!
-Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.

01:53.980 --> 01:59.077
No, they're not! They're ugly
and stupid and delicious!

01:59.252 --> 02:01.220
Plus, eating them is like a tradition.

02:01.387 --> 02:06.154
It goes back to the first Thanksgiving when
the lndians sat down with the cowboys.

02:06.860 --> 02:12.093
Oh, right. That's when they had
that big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.

02:12.499 --> 02:16.731
It's not just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet,
Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food..

02:16.903 --> 02:20.304
-Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
-She is?

02:20.540 --> 02:23.907
Yeah. Remember? I had to leave
the other day when you had that chicken.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.374
I thought that was
because I put the whole thing..

02:26.546 --> 02:28.741
on my hand
and made it walk across the table.

02:29.949 --> 02:34.886
It's not worth it to make a whole turkey
for just three people. It's a lot of work.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.589
But you gotta have turkey
on Thanksgiving!

02:37.824 --> 02:42.557
Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
Fourth of July with no apple pie.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.959
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.595
Fine, if it means that much to you.
But there's gonna be a ton left over.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.328
No. I promise I will finish that turkey.

02:53.573 --> 02:57.475
You're telling me you can eat
almost an entire turkey in one sitting?

02:57.710 --> 03:03.649
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
This is what we do.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.853
We may not be great
thinkers or world leaders..

03:08.121 --> 03:12.820
we don't read a lot or run fast,
but damn it, we can eat!

03:48.561 --> 03:51.530
Four wide receivers. On third and 18.

03:51.764 --> 03:57.361
Isn't it weird how next year
there will be a baby at the table?

04:00.373 --> 04:04.139
Rachel's. But good to know
where you're at.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.141
-Hey!
-Hey!

04:06.379 --> 04:08.279
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too!

04:08.548 --> 04:10.413
-Can I help?
-Yes.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.710
Chandler usually helps,
but he's into the game.

04:13.953 --> 04:18.913
Could you fold these napkins? I'm gonna
go across the hall to check on the yams.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.923
No, sweetie. No, not like that.

04:23.196 --> 04:26.256
We're not at a barn dance.

04:26.532 --> 04:30.161
Fold them like swans.
I showed you at Christmas. Remember?

04:30.336 --> 04:33.897
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.942
-So how's the game?
-I have no idea.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.443
-What?
-I'm pretending to watch..

04:42.682 --> 04:44.843
so I don't have to help out.

04:45.885 --> 04:51.846
I don't believe you!
That is brilliant!

04:52.358 --> 04:54.258
-And Monica has no idea?
-No.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.658
Once in a while,
I just yell stuff at the TV.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.658
Hey! What? Aw! Hey!

05:03.069 --> 05:06.937
-Your team winning?
-Anderson just scored again.

05:07.173 --> 05:09.971
There is no Anderson.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.380
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

05:14.580 --> 05:18.949
I can't help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.086
-You like football?
-Normally, I don't.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.190
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

05:26.726 --> 05:31.060
-You like Green Bay?
-It's only my favorite bay.

05:42.642 --> 05:46.738
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Will, I'm so glad that you came.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.810
You look great. You must've lost..

05:49.082 --> 05:53.712
150 pounds. I'll be on one of those
Subway commercials.

05:55.722 --> 06:00.091
-A pie!
-It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.852
-It's no good. Throw it out.
-Meet some people.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.066
This is my husband, Chandler.
This is Will.

06:07.300 --> 06:12.101
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand
but I'm really into the game.

06:12.338 --> 06:17.002
Plus, it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand next to each other.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.603
-This is Phoebe.
-Hi.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.908
Hey. Wow!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.446
Well done.

06:29.689 --> 06:34.854
-Wanna give me a hand?
-I can't get over how great you look.

06:35.061 --> 06:40.761
-You look incredible too. You're so fit.
-I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.

06:41.567 --> 06:46.027
-I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
-Great, I love Ross.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.106
Good. And Rachel Greene too.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.906
-Is there a problem?
-No. It's okay.

06:56.149 --> 07:00.085
It's just.. God, I hated her.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.277
-What?
-I hated her.

07:02.488 --> 07:05.719
She was horrible to me in high school.

07:05.958 --> 07:11.863
But hey, that was a long time ago. I'm in
a good place. Might be fun to see her again.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.590
Got any cakes or cookies
or something?

07:17.069 --> 07:20.004
No, Will! No!

07:20.239 --> 07:22.799
It's been a while since we screamed.
Maybe we should.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.067
-Oh, okay. No!
-Come on!

07:26.312 --> 07:30.180
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!

07:33.786 --> 07:38.155
What are you doing?
You've got an entire turkey to eat.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.986
Let me explain to you how
the human body works.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.993
I have to warm up my stomach first.

07:45.264 --> 07:48.893
-Eating chips is like stretching.
-Okay.

07:49.101 --> 07:53.970
-Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
-I'm here to tell you something.

07:54.207 --> 07:58.541
You can eat and eat, but nothing
will ever fill that void.

08:00.313 --> 08:05.546
-Who the hell is this guy?
-This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.709
-Want some chips?
-No.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.286
-Will!
-Ross!

08:11.524 --> 08:17.429
Hey, you came!
Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!

08:18.531 --> 08:21.830
-Hot stuff?
-It's good to see you, man.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.834
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?

08:25.404 --> 08:29.340
-I'm a commodities broker.
-That sounds interesting.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.136
-Yeah, it's not.
-Oh.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.472
-But I'm rich and thin.
-Oh.

08:35.681 --> 08:40.380
I haven't seen you since
Lance Davis' graduation party.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.383
That was such a fun night.

08:42.622 --> 08:46.820
Would've been good if we had
gotten in, but still fun.

08:47.026 --> 08:51.690
We were lame. Do you remember
how into dinosaurs we were?

08:54.433 --> 08:57.368
-Yeah.
-So, what do you do now?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.765
So how long are you in town?

09:02.942 --> 09:06.503
-Hi.
-Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.202
Rachel Greene.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.679
Oh, that's right.
Are you gonna be okay?

09:12.919 --> 09:19.017
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just..
God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.358
High school was a long time ago.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.657
Look at her standing there
with those yams.

09:26.866 --> 09:32.463
My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greene
and complex carbohydrates.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.738
Oh, my God. Who is that?

09:37.043 --> 09:42.276
-That's Will, from high school.
-Oh! I do not remember him.

09:42.548 --> 09:47.986
Wow, really got that sexy
smoldering thing going on.

09:52.124 --> 09:55.958
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.822
He's trying to mouth something to me.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.727
I hate you!

10:03.703 --> 10:06.194
-Okay, dinner's ready!
-Okay!

10:06.405 --> 10:10.273
-Solid effort. Solid effort.
-Oh, so who won?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.808
-Green Bay.
-Detroit.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.572
-What?
-The Lions technically won.

10:15.815 --> 10:20.752
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.921
Hi! Will, right?
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.

10:28.127 --> 10:33.224
-Oh, I remember you.
-Really? Aren't you sweet?

10:33.432 --> 10:38.597
I gotta tell you, I'm having
the hardest time placing you.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.238
Hang on! I think I remember you.

10:41.474 --> 10:46.935
Did we fool around at
Lance Davis' graduation party?

10:47.613 --> 10:50.878
-You are unbelievable.
-Thank you.

10:51.817 --> 10:57.016
Rachel? Why don't you sit here?
And Will, you sit way over there.

11:02.895 --> 11:06.387
That's it? Even if nobody helps me,
I can eat that. No problem.

11:06.632 --> 11:11.899
-At least give me a challenge.
-This is Chandler's chicken.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.634
This is the turkey.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.771
Oh. How big is that?

11:20.980 --> 11:26.418
-About 19 pounds.
-It's like me when I was born.

11:27.319 --> 11:32.586
-Who would like some yams? Will?
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

11:34.226 --> 11:37.161
What? Oh, can we please keep
the chicken..

11:37.363 --> 11:39.888
and the turkey on the other side?

11:40.099 --> 11:43.865
-The smell is just..
-Typical.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.037
-What?
-I said it was typical.

11:48.307 --> 11:54.405
Typical of you. Queen Rachel does
whatever she wants in Rachel-land.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.682
Seriously, who is this guy?

12:02.088 --> 12:04.852
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?

12:05.057 --> 12:10.085
-I don't know. Do I? Do I?
-I think you do.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.461
You were a little mean
to him in high school.

12:14.700 --> 12:19.364
-A little mean? You made my life miserable.
-I had no idea. I'm sorry.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.269
Well, you should be.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.267
But you worked so hard.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.946
-Yams!
-Okay.

12:30.649 --> 12:35.245
I'm real sorry for whatever
I did to you in high school.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.389
It wasn't just me. We had a club.

12:38.624 --> 12:43.493
-You had a club?
-The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!

12:43.729 --> 12:47.392
So you all just joined together
to hate me?

12:47.600 --> 12:51.900
-Who else was in this club?
-Me and Ross.

12:56.408 --> 13:00.276
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.

13:06.585 --> 13:10.885
-You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
-Yes, he was.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.351
No, no.

13:14.059 --> 13:19.929
-So who else was in this club?
-That exchange student from Thailand.

13:20.132 --> 13:24.296
But I don't think he knew what it was.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.867
You guys were cool.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.469
So, Ross, we went out for two years..

13:29.642 --> 13:32.475
and you never told me you were
in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?

13:32.645 --> 13:36.103
You went out with her? We had a pact.

13:37.216 --> 13:43.451
-It's not like it was binding forever.
-It had the word "eternity" in it.

13:44.723 --> 13:47.749
I'm thinking of joining
an "I Hate Turkey Club."

13:47.927 --> 13:50.555
Although, I do love a turkey club.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.331
Monica? Did you know about this?

13:55.568 --> 13:59.698
I didn't. Is that why
you used to lock the bedroom door?

13:59.939 --> 14:03.431
-Yeah.
-A little relieved, I gotta say.

14:05.277 --> 14:09.941
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.582
-The only reason I joined..
-Cofounded.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.616
Cofounded.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.649
Cofounded the club,
was that I was in love with you.

14:19.992 --> 14:23.894
I didn't handle it very well. If you think
about it, the "I Hate Rachel Club"..

14:24.163 --> 14:27.098
was really
the "I Love Rachel Club."

14:27.366 --> 14:30.494
Except that it was really
the "I Hate Rachel Club."

14:30.736 --> 14:35.036
So you'd get together
and say mean things about me?

14:35.274 --> 14:39.608
-We did a little more than that.
-No, no, no.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.512
What else did you do?

14:41.747 --> 14:45.877
-We started a rumor.
-What rumor?

14:46.185 --> 14:50.121
Come on, Will,
just take off your shirt and tell us.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.086
-Ross?
-It was no big deal.

14:56.362 --> 15:02.130
We said that.. The rumor was that..

15:02.401 --> 15:07.737
you had both male and female
reproductive parts.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.902
-What?
-That's right. We said your parents..

15:11.076 --> 15:17.606
flipped a coin, decided to raise you
as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.

15:17.883 --> 15:20.647
-Oh, my God!
-You started that?

15:20.886 --> 15:25.380
-You heard that?
-Everyone at our school heard it!

15:25.591 --> 15:28.890
Everyone at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?

15:29.094 --> 15:31.062
Oh, no!

15:32.331 --> 15:36.665
It makes sense now. This is why
Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.894
Why Billy would just stay
in this region.

15:40.139 --> 15:44.269
Billy's gay now, so that one's
not really our fault.

15:45.277 --> 15:49.077
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I thought it might be true.

15:49.315 --> 15:53.649
I was afraid that you were gonna cry
and then show it to me.

15:59.325 --> 16:02.783
Stop staring! There's nothing there!
It's not true!

16:02.995 --> 16:05.429
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.263
Come on, whip it out.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.210
You are my Everest.

16:28.420 --> 16:32.789
-You don't have to finish.
-I do. Otherwise, what's next?

16:33.058 --> 16:38.257
Today I can't finish a turkey,
but tomorrow I eat half a PowerBar..

16:38.497 --> 16:41.762
wrap it up and put it
in the fridge? No!

16:42.001 --> 16:47.200
I gotta change my pants. What was
I thinking? Jeans have no give.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.273
Guys, help me with the dishes.
There's a lot of pots and pans.

16:51.443 --> 16:54.105
Honey, I'd love to,
but the second game is about to start.

16:54.279 --> 16:58.978
Oh, yeah, the second game.
More football for the Pheebster.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.381
-Who's playing?
-Los Angeles.

17:01.553 --> 17:04.420
Last time I checked,
Los Angeles didn't have a football team.

17:04.590 --> 17:08.458
Did I say Los Angeles? I meant the team
that used to be in Los Angeles..

17:08.627 --> 17:12.358
and is now in St. Louis.
I actually knew that.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.500
Okay, quick, name three players
on that team.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.100
Gretzky..

17:18.937 --> 17:20.564
Agassi..

17:22.908 --> 17:25.376
I'm a pretty little girl.

17:29.481 --> 17:34.544
Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.

17:34.753 --> 17:39.713
"Dear Rach, you're such a great
person." Not girl, "person."

17:39.992 --> 17:43.758
I think you're reading a little
too much into it.

17:44.029 --> 17:47.897
"You're a great person.
Sorry about your teeny weenie."

17:51.670 --> 17:53.103
What do you want me to do..

17:53.272 --> 17:56.503
call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?

17:56.708 --> 17:59.233
-Yes.
-Also, tell them I'm skinny now.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.339
Oh! Me too!

18:02.548 --> 18:06.075
I won't call anybody.
It was a million years ago.

18:06.285 --> 18:11.746
I don't care. You told people
that I was half and half!

18:12.024 --> 18:15.755
I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.393
That's not totally true.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.892
-What?
-What?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.897
You did start that rumor about Ross..

18:23.135 --> 18:27.902
making out with Mrs. Altmann,
our 50-year-old librarian.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.634
How did you know that?

18:33.779 --> 18:37.215
-It's true?
-No.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.909
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it
behind the card catalog.

18:42.087 --> 18:47.115
-Hey, what were you doing in the library?
-They had magazines.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.817
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out..

18:50.062 --> 18:54.123
with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night
before he went back to Thailand.

18:55.234 --> 18:58.931
In high school you made out
with a 50-year-old woman?

18:59.171 --> 19:03.301
-Hey, she didn't look 50!
-Did she look 16?

19:03.542 --> 19:07.672
There's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.

19:08.180 --> 19:12.082
-Wow.
-She didn't photograph well!

19:12.317 --> 19:14.683
She probably wasn't familiar
with the process..

19:14.853 --> 19:17.947
having spent most of her life sitting
for oil paintings.

19:19.458 --> 19:24.157
How did this happen? Did she lure
you to an early-bird dinner?

19:30.235 --> 19:35.832
I was working late in the library
one afternoon. It was just the two of us.

19:36.041 --> 19:40.000
She needed some help
with her word jumble.

19:40.412 --> 19:44.178
And one thing led to another.

19:44.750 --> 19:50.416
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.859
May she rest in peace.

19:57.229 --> 20:01.689
-Didn't she walk with a cane?
-Only when it was damp!

20:02.134 --> 20:07.162
I can't believe you told people
about this. Everybody knew?

20:07.439 --> 20:11.773
-You know what? I'm back in the club!
-Yeah!

20:11.944 --> 20:14.845
-Shall I call the meeting to order?
-Is everybody present?

20:15.013 --> 20:17.447
With the exception of Ta-Taka.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.481
-I wanna join!
-Phoebe?

20:19.718 --> 20:24.052
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.
I didn't go to high school.

20:24.323 --> 20:28.919
But three of us would meet behind
a dumpster to learn French.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.062
Fine, you can have
your stupid, little club.

20:32.231 --> 20:36.691
But what you did to me is way worse
than what I did to you.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.360
-You gave me a teeny weenie.
-Yeah!

20:43.542 --> 20:47.535
You're just being silly.
Rachel, even with that rumor..

20:47.713 --> 20:52.013
you were one of the most popular girls.
Everyone wanted to be like you.

20:52.184 --> 20:56.052
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.052
Wow.

20:59.391 --> 21:03.589
And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor,
no one would've known who you were.

21:03.762 --> 21:08.825
-She put you on the map.
-As a romancer of the elderly.

21:10.035 --> 21:13.232
Mrs. Altmann, you can tell,
she used to be pretty.

21:13.438 --> 21:17.465
The eyes did still sparkle.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.839
This stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.846
You got so much more
important stuff going on in your life.

21:27.085 --> 21:29.553
Can't you just let this go?

21:31.990 --> 21:35.756
-She's right.
-We are having a baby together.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.861
Hold on.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.860
-You got her pregnant?
-Yeah.

21:42.334 --> 21:44.666
-Are you getting married?
-No.

21:44.870 --> 21:49.603
So you knocked her up but you're
not gonna marry her. Dude.

21:52.577 --> 21:55.808
-Anybody?
-Okay.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.847
It's exactly how I imagined
it would be.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.320
All right, where's that turkey?

22:12.998 --> 22:18.732
-Those are my maternity pants!
-No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

22:25.177 --> 22:28.374
Well, that's it. I'm done.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.874
Here come the meat sweats.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.120
Well, Joey, we're all
very proud of you.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.295
I believe we can expect a call
from the president any moment now.

22:45.297 --> 22:49.700
-Anything we can do?
-No. Just nobody press on my stomach.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.927
You can keep those pants, by the way.

22:54.139 --> 22:58.235
What you got there?
What is that, pie?

22:58.443 --> 23:02.607
-Yeah. You want some?
-Just cut me a little sliver.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.913
Little bigger.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.614
Little bigger.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.948
Are you afraid you're gonna run out?
Cut me a real piece!
