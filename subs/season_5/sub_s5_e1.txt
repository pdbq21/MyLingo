WEBVTT

00:02.185 --> 00:05.848
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate...

00:06.122 --> 00:08.955
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

00:09.859 --> 00:12.089
Now, Ross, repeat after me.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.085
"l, Ross."

00:14.330 --> 00:15.490
I, Ross.

00:15.832 --> 00:17.322
"Take thee, Emily."

00:17.600 --> 00:19.158
Take thee, Rachel.

00:29.713 --> 00:31.510
Shall I go on?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.646
He said, "Rachel," right?

00:33.850 --> 00:36.148
Do you think I should go up there?

00:36.886 --> 00:38.820
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

00:39.022 --> 00:41.320
I think we'd better start again.

00:42.525 --> 00:44.049
Repeat after me.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.352
"l, Ross."

00:45.628 --> 00:46.856
I, Ross.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.155
"Take thee, Emily."

00:52.535 --> 00:54.799
Take thee, Emily.

00:56.873 --> 00:58.841
Like there'd be anybody else.

01:00.510 --> 01:04.139
"As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

01:04.380 --> 01:05.972
...till death parts us."

01:06.182 --> 01:10.915
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

01:11.187 --> 01:13.747
...until death parts us.

01:14.057 --> 01:16.252
Really, I do. Emily.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.525
Do you have the rings?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.192
Place this ring on Ross' finger...

01:23.433 --> 01:26.197
...as a symbol of
your bond everlasting.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.207
Ross, place this ring...

01:34.410 --> 01:36.435
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

01:36.679 --> 01:39.113
...of the love that
encircles you forever.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.077
Happy to.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.279
They have made
their declarations...

01:45.555 --> 01:50.117
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.227
You may kiss the bride.

01:59.102 --> 02:02.401
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.571
Just keep smiling.

02:12.816 --> 02:15.114
Well, that went well.

02:15.752 --> 02:18.880
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.220
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

02:26.496 --> 02:28.430
The One After Ross Says "Rachel"

03:14.477 --> 03:17.105
You spoiled everything!
It's a nightmare!

03:17.313 --> 03:21.807
My friends and family are out there!
How can I face them?

03:22.118 --> 03:24.245
No matter what happens with them...

03:24.487 --> 03:25.977
...we still get cake, right?

03:28.491 --> 03:33.224
That's all right. You take your time.
I'll be right out here.

03:34.731 --> 03:37.063
She's just fixing her makeup.

03:37.433 --> 03:38.422
I hate you!

03:38.668 --> 03:41.330
And I love you!

03:43.740 --> 03:46.231
A bad time
to say the wrong name, huh?

03:48.912 --> 03:50.812
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.908
People should be dancing.

03:55.118 --> 03:57.780
This is a party! Come on!

03:57.987 --> 03:59.614
Joey! Dance!

04:11.834 --> 04:13.768
Yes, Waltham lnteriors.

04:13.970 --> 04:18.532
This is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Filangie.

04:20.443 --> 04:21.432
Who?

04:21.644 --> 04:25.512
I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

04:25.715 --> 04:28.377
Without it, in the brain of Ross...

04:28.618 --> 04:31.815
...women's names are interchangeable.

04:32.055 --> 04:34.182
Through no fault of his own.

04:34.991 --> 04:36.288
Oh, my God! Phoebe.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.727
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.

04:40.964 --> 04:42.989
Oh, no! You have it too!

04:45.435 --> 04:48.268
What kind of bitch hangs up
on a doctor?

04:56.579 --> 05:00.071
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

05:00.316 --> 05:03.217
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight.

05:03.486 --> 05:06.922
I'm worried about what it
might do to our friendship.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.084
I know.

05:09.926 --> 05:13.418
-How could we have let this happen?
-Seven times!

05:15.431 --> 05:18.229
You know, look.
We were away.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.560
In a foreign, romantic country.

05:22.105 --> 05:23.504
I blame London.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.105
Bad London!

05:26.743 --> 05:27.767
So look...

05:28.111 --> 05:32.047
...while we're still in London,
we can keep doing it, right?

05:32.248 --> 05:34.739
Well, I don't see that
we have a choice.

05:35.218 --> 05:37.880
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.452
Only here.

05:41.057 --> 05:43.457
You know, I saw
a wine cellar downstairs.

05:44.394 --> 05:46.419
I'll meet you there in two minutes.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.865
Mon? I gotta ask you something.

05:51.134 --> 05:52.123
Now?

05:52.368 --> 05:56.566
Ross said my name.
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.

05:57.073 --> 05:58.438
I don't know.

05:59.142 --> 06:00.803
Monica, what should I do?

06:01.544 --> 06:03.671
Just do the right thing.

06:04.847 --> 06:06.109
What?

06:06.282 --> 06:09.376
Tow the line! Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!

06:09.585 --> 06:12.782
I'll talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.283
Wait! Rachel, no.

06:15.558 --> 06:16.582
He's married.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.388
Married.

06:18.594 --> 06:21.586
If you don't realize that,
I can't help you.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.766
Okay. You're right.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.457
You're right.
You can't help me.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.604
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

06:33.776 --> 06:36.768
Who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

06:37.013 --> 06:38.776
How are you supposed to eat this?

06:38.981 --> 06:40.448
Hey, what's up?

06:43.019 --> 06:44.680
You and me, next dance?

06:44.921 --> 06:47.754
Sorry, dear,
I only dance when I'm drunk.

06:47.924 --> 06:49.983
Want me to get you something?

06:52.028 --> 06:53.757
We were supposed to meet.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.987
-Forget it. That's off.
-Why?

06:56.265 --> 06:59.291
The next tour of the wine cellar...

06:59.836 --> 07:03.704
...will commence in two minutes.

07:05.608 --> 07:07.132
Joey, what are you doing?

07:07.343 --> 07:09.504
You promised, no meat
till Phoebe has the babies.

07:09.712 --> 07:12.476
We're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

07:13.316 --> 07:15.045
-True.
-He's got a point.

07:20.957 --> 07:22.788
I'm sorry things aren't working out.

07:24.127 --> 07:27.324
It could be better.
It'll be okay, right?

07:27.530 --> 07:30.658
Oh, yeah! Of course.
She'll get over this.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.333
So you said my name.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.129
You just said it
because you saw me there.

07:35.338 --> 07:37.966
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

07:38.207 --> 07:40.141
"l take thee, Circus Freak."

07:41.811 --> 07:44.041
It didn't mean anything.
It's a mistake.

07:44.247 --> 07:47.580
It didn't mean anything.
Right?

07:47.817 --> 07:51.685
Oh, no! Of course
it didn't mean anything.

07:51.921 --> 07:55.254
I can understand why Emily
thought it meant something...

07:55.491 --> 07:56.719
...because it was you.

07:56.993 --> 08:00.360
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't! It didn't!

08:01.764 --> 08:04.892
The band's ready
for your first dance with Emily.

08:05.101 --> 08:07.831
Oh! The band's ready!

08:08.037 --> 08:12.838
We've got to do what the band says.
I don't care about the stupid band!

08:14.677 --> 08:16.440
You spit on me, man!

08:17.780 --> 08:19.247
I'm sorry.

08:19.615 --> 08:22.516
Emily is taking kind of a long time.

08:22.718 --> 08:24.913
When I locked myself up
at my wedding...

08:25.121 --> 08:28.386
...I was trying to pop
the window out of the frame.

08:28.624 --> 08:31.593
Get the hell out of there.
You know?

08:39.535 --> 08:40.695
I'm coming in!

08:43.739 --> 08:46.105
Oh, look at that.
Same thing.

08:50.613 --> 08:55.073
In the middle of everything,
if I scream, "Yippee!" just ignore me.

08:58.254 --> 09:01.223
-Oh, my God! Rachel!
-Oh, hello, Rachel.

09:02.225 --> 09:04.159
Ross said my name.

09:04.427 --> 09:05.894
Okay? My name!

09:06.229 --> 09:07.958
Ross said my name up there.

09:08.164 --> 09:10.632
That obviously means
he still loves me!

09:11.767 --> 09:13.758
Don't believe me.
I know I'm right.

09:14.003 --> 09:16.130
Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

09:16.405 --> 09:17.633
Yes, we do.

09:19.342 --> 09:21.276
But we have to change first.

09:21.510 --> 09:23.171
Yes, I want to change.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.313
-Go get a table.
-We'll only be five minutes.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.107
Fifteen minutes.

09:34.857 --> 09:36.449
Oh, Phoebe! It's Phoebe!

09:36.659 --> 09:38.684
-Oh, hey, hey.
-Oh, great.

09:39.795 --> 09:41.092
So, what happened?

09:41.297 --> 09:42.787
Well, Ross said my name.

09:43.532 --> 09:46.000
But I don't think
that means anything.

09:46.202 --> 09:48.295
Let's look at this objectively.

09:48.537 --> 09:49.970
Ninth grade, right?

09:50.172 --> 09:51.639
The obsession starts.

09:53.776 --> 09:56.939
Then he sees me in
a two-piece for the first time.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.443
His obsession begins to grow, right?

09:59.982 --> 10:01.882
Why don't we go change in my room?

10:02.118 --> 10:03.517
My clothes are....

10:19.735 --> 10:20.861
Wow, you look

10:21.137 --> 10:22.536
No time for that.

10:26.642 --> 10:30.134
Hey, dude! Let me in!
I got a girl out here!

10:31.314 --> 10:32.906
I got a girl in here!

10:34.050 --> 10:37.247
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.212
Well, we're hanging out.

10:42.325 --> 10:46.261
Which one of us will be
having sex in there? Me or you?

10:46.896 --> 10:49.729
I suppose I would
have to say you.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.260
-What if we're watching a movie?
-Which we are!

10:54.537 --> 10:56.061
And we've paid for it.

10:56.339 --> 10:57.533
It's My Giant.

10:58.841 --> 10:59.865
My Giant?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.169
I love that movie!

11:07.183 --> 11:08.445
Think this is okay?

11:08.718 --> 11:11.551
Well, Ross and Emily
aren't going to use it.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.048
Oh, it's so beautiful!

11:16.125 --> 11:17.854
I don't feel right about this.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.727
This is the honeymoon suite.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.366
The room expects sex.

11:27.236 --> 11:30.763
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.806
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.980
Nope! Not under here!

11:45.955 --> 11:48.287
-You didn't find her?
-I've looked everywhere.

11:48.557 --> 11:51.151
You couldn't have,
or you would've found her.

11:51.394 --> 11:54.090
-Keep looking!
-Yeah! For about 30 minutes?

11:54.296 --> 11:55.729
Or 45?

11:58.467 --> 12:01.061
In 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

12:04.573 --> 12:09.636
For all I know, she's trying to find me
but couldn't, because I kept moving.

12:09.945 --> 12:12.573
From now on,
I'm staying in one place.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.248
Right here.

12:18.087 --> 12:20.487
-It's getting late.
-We're going to go.

12:21.924 --> 12:24.586
Do you guys mind staying here
for a while?

12:25.928 --> 12:28.488
We've got to get up early
and catch that plane.

12:28.697 --> 12:30.688
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

12:33.269 --> 12:34.702
That's cool.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.830
But we'll stay here with you.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.643
Thanks, guys!

12:43.946 --> 12:48.007
I really appreciate this,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.890
We have to leave in an hour.

13:05.167 --> 13:07.795
I know. I've been looking
at those doors.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.972
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.671
We can't do that.
That's insane.

13:13.976 --> 13:17.412
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

13:17.680 --> 13:19.045
...Iet's go for it.

13:29.325 --> 13:30.758
Nope.

13:32.094 --> 13:34.756
-She's not with us.
-We've come for her things.

13:34.997 --> 13:37.056
Where is she?

13:37.333 --> 13:41.599
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.

13:41.937 --> 13:46.931
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

13:48.577 --> 13:52.240
But I think you're
absolutely delicious!

13:52.915 --> 13:56.942
Excuse me,
I'm standing right here.

13:58.354 --> 13:59.548
Oh, yes.

13:59.788 --> 14:01.915
There you are.

14:04.193 --> 14:07.754
Hurry up! Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.

14:07.997 --> 14:09.021
Goodbye, Geller.

14:09.298 --> 14:11.198
Now, hold on. Hold on.

14:11.433 --> 14:16.370
Your daughter and I are supposed
to leave tonight for our honeymoon.

14:16.672 --> 14:20.836
Tell her I'll be at that airport,
and I hope she will too.

14:21.377 --> 14:24.403
I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.874
She's just a friend.

14:26.148 --> 14:27.911
Tell Emily I love her and...

14:28.183 --> 14:31.448
...I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

14:31.687 --> 14:35.123
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

14:36.659 --> 14:38.149
All right, I'll tell her.

14:38.827 --> 14:40.692
Come on, bugger face!

14:41.330 --> 14:42.524
Call me.

14:43.666 --> 14:48.763
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?

15:06.055 --> 15:09.183
Maybe it's best we never
got to do it again.

15:09.391 --> 15:12.519
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

15:16.365 --> 15:19.960
Technically, we still are
over international waters.

15:21.303 --> 15:25.034
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?

15:32.548 --> 15:34.015
Can I ask you something?

15:37.653 --> 15:41.714
Felicity and I watched
My Giant. And I thought:

15:41.924 --> 15:45.189
"I'll never be as good an actor
as that giant."

15:45.427 --> 15:49.056
Do you think I'm wasting my life
with this acting thing?

15:50.833 --> 15:52.824
The giant's five years
younger than me.

15:53.068 --> 15:54.933
You think I'll ever get there?

16:00.109 --> 16:02.509
-Thanks, man.
-Okay, man.

16:02.778 --> 16:05.713
But what about how much
taller he is than me?

16:06.615 --> 16:10.608
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

16:10.853 --> 16:14.584
Who knows what science will
come up with in the future...

16:14.857 --> 16:18.554
...but what if I die an unsuccessful,
regular-size man?

16:20.596 --> 16:23.588
You've been in the
bathroom for a half-hour.

16:24.466 --> 16:25.455
I know!

16:26.602 --> 16:28.263
Had the beef tips, huh?

16:46.155 --> 16:47.713
You ate meat!

16:49.958 --> 16:51.050
You had sex!

16:53.462 --> 16:54.451
No, we didn't.

16:54.630 --> 16:57.827
I know you didn't.
I was talking about Monica.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.735
I did not have sex.

17:00.936 --> 17:05.999
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
and making me fat.

17:06.175 --> 17:08.905
-I'll say hi to the chick and duck.
-Me too!

17:09.144 --> 17:11.806
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.

17:12.314 --> 17:15.044
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll just go home.

17:25.828 --> 17:27.227
We certainly are alone.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.296
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

17:32.501 --> 17:35.561
Listen, since we're on that subject...

17:35.804 --> 17:38.466
...I just wanted to tell you that....

17:38.741 --> 17:41.733
I was going through
a hard time in London...

17:41.977 --> 17:47.142
...with my brother getting married and
that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.476
Well, anyway, I just....

17:50.686 --> 17:54.178
That night meant a lot to me.
And I'm trying to say thanks.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.985
You know, that night
meant a lot to me too.

18:01.263 --> 18:04.426
It wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.829
It just meant a lot because
you're really hot.

18:12.274 --> 18:13.298
Is that okay?

18:13.509 --> 18:14.840
That's okay.

18:15.878 --> 18:16.867
And I'm cute too?

18:19.481 --> 18:20.641
And you're cute too!

18:20.849 --> 18:21.941
Thank you.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.845
All right, I gotta go unpack.

18:43.071 --> 18:45.471
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

18:47.042 --> 18:49.033
-Oh, that counts!
-Oh, good!

19:01.156 --> 19:02.589
What are you doing here?

19:02.858 --> 19:06.191
I've been on standby for
a flight home for hours.

19:07.863 --> 19:09.228
So no sign of Emily?

19:09.765 --> 19:10.925
Not yet.

19:16.505 --> 19:18.063
When do you have to leave?

19:18.273 --> 19:22.141
This is the last call
for flight 1066 to A thens.

19:22.344 --> 19:23.868
The last call.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.842
Pretty soon, I guess.

19:28.517 --> 19:29.916
I'm sorry.

19:31.453 --> 19:32.511
I don't understand.

19:32.721 --> 19:34.621
How could she do this?

19:34.857 --> 19:39.226
Am I a complete idiot for
thinking she'd actually show up?

19:40.863 --> 19:45.027
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.

19:46.068 --> 19:47.399
Same difference.

19:47.603 --> 19:52.700
All passengers for flight 1066
to Athens should now be onboard.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.374
I get it!

19:58.881 --> 20:00.371
Well, that's that.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.940
No, you know what?

20:03.151 --> 20:04.448
I think you should go.

20:06.221 --> 20:07.813
I think you should go...

20:08.090 --> 20:10.422
...by yourself.
Get some distance.

20:10.659 --> 20:13.321
Clear your head.
It would be really good.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.257
I don't know.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.160
Come on.
It would be really good for you.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.729
I could do that.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.900
I can't even believe her.

20:27.109 --> 20:29.009
You know what?
I am going to go.

20:29.278 --> 20:30.404
-Good.
-Why not?

20:30.612 --> 20:31.636
-Right?
-Right.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.136
Thanks.

20:33.348 --> 20:34.815
I'll see you back at home.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.176
If I ever get a flight out of here.

20:40.088 --> 20:42.420
What? Wait, what?

20:44.126 --> 20:45.457
Why don't you come?

20:45.661 --> 20:48.755
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?

20:49.998 --> 20:53.661
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?

20:54.670 --> 20:57.298
Yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can....

20:57.539 --> 20:59.370
You can lay on the beach...

20:59.608 --> 21:02.941
...and I can cry over
my failed marriage.

21:03.211 --> 21:05.338
You see how I make jokes?

21:06.148 --> 21:07.445
Really. I mean....

21:08.317 --> 21:09.841
I could use a friend.

21:10.152 --> 21:13.610
Oh, wow. Maybe.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.385
Yes, I can do that!

21:18.193 --> 21:20.320
-Cool.
-All right, cool.

21:22.297 --> 21:24.458
Okay, we're going to Greece.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.565
I forgot my jacket!

21:26.802 --> 21:29.032
Well, you tell them to wait.

21:29.338 --> 21:30.737
Wait! Wait!

21:51.994 --> 21:54.519
I'll have a glass of Merlot...

21:54.796 --> 21:57.492
...and he'll have
a wine spritzer.

22:04.806 --> 22:07.206
Look!
The airport's moving.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.069
Are we moving?

22:09.344 --> 22:11.403
Are we?
Why are we moving?

22:12.881 --> 22:16.009
Does the captain know
that we're moving?

22:17.652 --> 22:18.641
Oh, my gosh!
