WEBVTT

00:02.435 --> 00:05.268
I can't believe
you'd actually say that.

00:05.505 --> 00:08.804
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.770
No way.
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.776
He's gotta be
the toughest snack there is.

00:16.316 --> 00:19.808
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with Cornnuts.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.878
They're crazy.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.491
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.060
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

00:31.564 --> 00:34.192
I can't believe it.
He's looking right at us.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.332
Oh, that is so sick.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.196
I feel violated.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.200
And not in a good way.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.898
How can people do that?

00:44.744 --> 00:48.510
You guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.313
The One With the Evil Orthodontist

01:39.165 --> 01:42.157
Years from now,
school children will study it...

01:42.368 --> 01:45.394
...as one of the greatest
first dates ever.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.006
-Yeah.
-I'll say, yeah.

01:48.708 --> 01:49.834
It was unbelievable.

01:50.076 --> 01:53.170
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.

01:53.379 --> 01:57.372
-Have you called her?
-She'd know I like her. That's crazy.

01:57.584 --> 01:58.812
Guys. It's gross.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.816
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

02:02.021 --> 02:04.990
-I'm right. Right?
-Yeah, let her dangle.

02:06.826 --> 02:11.593
I can't believe my parents are
pushing me to find one of you people.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.164
Come on. Just do it.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.734
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

02:19.372 --> 02:23.308
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.571
-Her machine.
-Answering machine?

02:29.849 --> 02:33.410
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.918
So, why didn't you say anything?

02:38.191 --> 02:41.217
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

02:41.427 --> 02:45.056
... I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

02:46.266 --> 02:49.394
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.560
What's going on?

02:51.771 --> 02:54.831
-They're just talking.
-Does he look upset?

02:55.074 --> 02:58.510
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?

03:00.246 --> 03:02.111
No. Actually, he's smiling.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.509
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.683
What? What? What?

03:05.885 --> 03:09.651
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

03:11.758 --> 03:16.695
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.897
See? Hey, Rach.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.363
How'd it go?

03:23.870 --> 03:27.533
You know, it was actually
really great.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.501
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.645
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.609
Not a good day for birds.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.578
Then we went to Bendel's.

03:37.817 --> 03:41.548
And I told him not to, but he got me
a bottle of Chanel.

03:42.322 --> 03:46.088
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

03:46.292 --> 03:50.922
...to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?

03:51.164 --> 03:55.066
Right. Well, we never actually
got to that.

03:55.301 --> 03:58.236
It was just so nice to see him again.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.999
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.841
It was just nice.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.907
That's nice twice.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.307
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.151
Where have you been?

04:15.154 --> 04:17.122
It was different
with him today.

04:17.323 --> 04:20.087
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.

04:20.326 --> 04:24.922
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.100
-Why?
-I have my reasons.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.096
He's engaged to another woman...

04:35.308 --> 04:38.209
...who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.976
All right.
I know it's stupid.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.445
I'll see him this afternoon
and put an end to it.

04:51.658 --> 04:55.116
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.391
No, it wasn't.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.795
It was so nice
having this little sink here.

05:08.841 --> 05:14.143
Then with authority, hang up.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.806
Will you just leave her the message?

05:18.017 --> 05:19.985
Okay. All right, fine.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.250
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.854
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

05:33.633 --> 05:34.793
Bye-bye.

05:35.702 --> 05:36.862
Oh, God.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.372
That's what you've been working on
for two hours?

05:42.975 --> 05:44.840
Hey, I've been honing.

05:45.678 --> 05:50.012
-What was with the dishes?
-She might think I'm in a restaurant.

05:50.283 --> 05:54.379
I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here...

05:54.620 --> 05:56.815
... honing for the last two hours?

05:57.123 --> 06:01.355
-The telescope guy's doing it again.
-Oh, my God.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.896
Go away.
Stop looking in here.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.533
Great.
Now he's waving back.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.629
We gotta do something.

06:12.905 --> 06:17.968
I caught him looking into our place.
I feel like I can't do stuff.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.709
What kind of stuff?

06:22.849 --> 06:26.148
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

06:26.352 --> 06:29.446
...but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.051
You cook naked?

06:32.325 --> 06:35.726
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

06:38.998 --> 06:42.627
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.503
What's the matter?

06:46.205 --> 06:48.833
I just
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.010
No, it was.
It was very, very good.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.738
-What about Mindy?
-Way better than Mindy.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.747
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

07:01.487 --> 07:04.354
If you want, I'll
break it off with her.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.493
No, don't do that.
Not for me.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.288
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.261
Thanks, Bernice.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.632
Let's go away this weekend.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.936
-This is all way too
-No, we can go to Aruba.

07:21.707 --> 07:25.143
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

07:25.344 --> 07:29.280
...it was really nice.
You would've liked it.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.974
I had a bra.

07:43.830 --> 07:44.797
Hey, Dr. Farber.

07:44.997 --> 07:48.660
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.797
We're starting to see
some real progress.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.667
-What?
-I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.682
Can I use your phone?

08:11.357 --> 08:13.985
For future reference,
that thing in your hand...

08:14.193 --> 08:16.423
...can also be used as a phone.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.660
Yes, it's working.

08:23.636 --> 08:27.402
-Why isn't she calling?
-Maybe she never got your message.

08:27.607 --> 08:31.043
Call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

08:31.244 --> 08:33.405
...that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

08:34.247 --> 08:38.707
-Doesn't that make me seem?
-Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

08:38.951 --> 08:41.442
You obviously saw my personal ad.

08:44.557 --> 08:45.387
How many beeps?

08:45.591 --> 08:47.115
She answered.

08:48.928 --> 08:52.227
This is where you'd use
that "hello" word.

08:53.132 --> 08:55.623
I won't talk to her.
She got my message...

08:55.902 --> 09:00.134
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.003
God, I miss just being needy.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.201
So how'd he take it?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.947
Pretty well, actually.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.946
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

09:17.256 --> 09:18.621
Oh, do l?

09:21.427 --> 09:26.091
-We ended up having sex in his chair.
-You had sex in his chair?

09:30.937 --> 09:34.600
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't l?

09:34.941 --> 09:36.499
You had what?

09:37.843 --> 09:39.811
Sex in his chair.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.284
What...? What were you thinking?

09:45.484 --> 09:48.612
I don't know.
We still care about each other.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.813
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.753
It's nothing like me and Carol.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.956
If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

10:01.267 --> 10:04.862
... right here, right now,"
what would you say?

10:05.805 --> 10:08.000
If it helps, I could slide over.

10:10.343 --> 10:15.110
It's a totally different situation.
It's apples and oranges.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.977
It's orthodontists and lesbians
I gotta go.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.920
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.318
I have things to do with my life.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.822
I have a jam-packed schedule.

10:28.027 --> 10:31.622
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?

10:45.578 --> 10:46.909
Mindy.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.176
How are you?

10:50.583 --> 10:54.542
Yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.811
Really, oh, God

10:59.325 --> 11:04.388
I'm working tomorrow, but if you
want, you can come by if you'd like.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.622
Great.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.266
Great.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.605
So I'll see you tomorrow.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.400
Okay. Bye.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.104
Oh, God. Oh, God.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.375
So how's Mindy?

11:24.950 --> 11:30.582
She wants to see me tomorrow. She
sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.455
It's me. I just
Mindy.

11:37.963 --> 11:41.421
Mindy. No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

11:58.584 --> 12:01.314
Hell is filled
with people like you.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.187
He's back.
The peeper's back.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.156
-Get down.
-Get down?

12:09.628 --> 12:10.788
And boogie.

12:12.798 --> 12:16.325
I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.160
She may not even know.

12:18.471 --> 12:24.000
I haven't heard from her in seven
months, what else is it about?

12:24.210 --> 12:26.235
She was my best friend.

12:26.512 --> 12:30.243
We went to camp together,
she taught me how to kiss....

12:33.219 --> 12:36.120
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.256
-I feel so
-Naughty.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.853
-See you later.
-I'll walk with you.

12:44.096 --> 12:49.625
When she taught you to kiss, were you
wearing any kind of little uniform?

12:51.570 --> 12:53.197
That's fine, yeah.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.772
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

12:57.977 --> 13:00.912
-Take it with you.
-We haven't had a second date...

13:01.113 --> 13:04.605
-...she needs to hear me pee?
-Why don't you call her?

13:04.817 --> 13:08.048
I can't. I left a message.
I have some pride.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.222
-Do you?
-No.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.085
Danielle, hi.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.265
It's Chandler.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.932
I'm fine.

13:23.602 --> 13:24.432
Listen....

13:24.637 --> 13:28.368
I don't know if you tried
to call me because...

13:28.574 --> 13:31.475
... I accidentally shut off my phone.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.579
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.745
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

13:41.954 --> 13:45.788
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.993
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.927
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.332
Hey, you.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.302
So what's up?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.836
We should really be sitting for this.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.981
Sure we should.

14:20.092 --> 14:23.357
I'm gonna ask once,
and I want a straight answer.

14:23.562 --> 14:28.329
Not like when I asked if those red
pants made my ass look big.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.902
I know things have been weird...

14:31.103 --> 14:34.095
...but you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie...

14:34.306 --> 14:36.934
...who's bitter because
she lost weight...

14:37.142 --> 14:40.043
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

14:40.246 --> 14:43.181
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
-Okay.

14:45.284 --> 14:48.014
Will you be my maid of honor?

14:51.156 --> 14:53.124
-Of course.
-That's so great.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.120
It is. It is. It is.

14:56.495 --> 15:00.261
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.768
-What?
-That's not all.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.431
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't.

15:12.144 --> 15:15.671
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.072
What would make you think that?

15:18.417 --> 15:21.318
Since the engagement,
he's acted weird.

15:21.587 --> 15:26.388
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.484
Really?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.897
If it'll make you feel any better...

15:33.165 --> 15:36.566
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he was weird too.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.067
Oh, God.
That's what I was afraid of.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.899
What's what you were afraid of?

15:43.409 --> 15:48.142
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and l...

15:48.347 --> 15:52.181
... kind of had
a little thing on the side.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.247
-What?
-I know, I know.

15:55.454 --> 16:00.517
When he proposed, people said, "He'll
do to you what he did to Rachel."

16:00.726 --> 16:03.058
And now I feel so stupid.

16:07.433 --> 16:08.832
You are so stupid.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.428
We are both so stupid.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.401
What do you mean?

16:17.509 --> 16:18.840
Smell familiar?

16:22.214 --> 16:23.613
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.582
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.810
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.458
Oh, my.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.240
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

16:49.508 --> 16:52.341
-Ring, damn it, ring.
-Thanks.

16:55.481 --> 16:59.508
-You know our phone's not working?
-What?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.846
I called and there was no answer.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.647
I turned it off.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.018
Mother of God, I turned it off.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.389
Just like you told her you did.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.598
Just pointing out the irony.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.893
I went across the street
to the doorman.

17:17.236 --> 17:21.104
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

17:22.241 --> 17:24.038
Can I use your phone?

17:27.613 --> 17:30.309
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.776
"Heating device."

17:33.352 --> 17:34.683
Radiator.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.081
Five letters.

17:36.488 --> 17:37.955
"Rdtor."

17:42.761 --> 17:44.422
Yeah, is Sidney there?

17:45.697 --> 17:48.495
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.327
So she's a woman, so what?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.800
Yeah, so what?

17:53.138 --> 17:57.165
I live across the street, and I know
about your telescope.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.338
And I don't appreciate it.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.341
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?

18:02.781 --> 18:07.684
If I wanna walk around in my
underwear, I shouldn't have to feel

18:07.886 --> 18:09.547
Thank you.

18:11.557 --> 18:15.220
That's not really the point.
The point is, that

18:15.427 --> 18:18.521
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally

18:20.466 --> 18:23.026
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.267
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.998
The green dress? Really?

18:31.210 --> 18:34.373
She said you looked like
lngrid Bergman.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.881
Did she mention me?

18:43.655 --> 18:47.523
She wants to know why you tie
the towel around your head.

18:48.026 --> 18:51.257
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?

18:52.097 --> 18:54.691
It's a leave-in conditioner.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.136
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.432
Come on...

19:03.041 --> 19:05.703
-...in.
-Hello, sweetheart.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.341
What you guys doing here?

19:08.580 --> 19:11.344
We are here to break up with you.

19:12.584 --> 19:13.744
Both of you?

19:14.186 --> 19:19.453
We think you're a horrible person,
and bad things should happen to you.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.020
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.628
I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

19:25.898 --> 19:30.062
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

19:31.403 --> 19:34.804
Which one of us
are you talking to there?

19:36.742 --> 19:37.902
Mindy.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.634
Of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.379
When we were having sex
in that chair?

19:43.815 --> 19:47.182
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was thinking of you.

19:47.419 --> 19:52.880
Please. That second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.820
You did it twice?

19:55.027 --> 19:59.259
The first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.729
Honey, sweetheart, look.
Just give me another chance.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.769
We'll start over.
We'll go back to Aruba.

20:06.972 --> 20:11.966
What is it with you and Aruba?
Do you have a deal with the airlines?

20:12.778 --> 20:14.075
What do you say?

20:14.346 --> 20:17.008
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.910
Jason Castalano 's choking
on his retainer.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.983
Oh, God.
I'll be right there, Bernice.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.315
Look, please don't go anywhere.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.424
I'll be right back.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.996
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.925
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?

20:36.134 --> 20:39.467
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

20:39.671 --> 20:42.299
...and take some punches.
This feels great.

20:43.709 --> 20:47.201
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.640
What are you talking about?

20:49.881 --> 20:52.679
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.977
He is Satan in a smock.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.621
I know he's not perfect.

21:01.293 --> 21:06.287
But the truth is at the end of
the day, I still really wanna be...

21:06.565 --> 21:09.796
... Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

21:10.535 --> 21:12.526
... D. D.S.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.399
Oh, God.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.472
I hope you can find a way
to be happy for me.

21:18.744 --> 21:22.180
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

21:22.447 --> 21:26.645
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.223
You okay?

21:36.928 --> 21:38.225
Really?

21:40.766 --> 21:43.394
Since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

21:43.602 --> 21:47.003
...I've wondered whether I made
the right choice.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.763
And now I know.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.502
I'm so glad.

21:55.714 --> 21:57.272
Big day.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.990
I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

22:09.227 --> 22:12.196
He's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat....

22:12.397 --> 22:14.058
Did you know he's gay?

22:17.436 --> 22:21.395
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

22:24.076 --> 22:25.543
Danielle, hi.

22:25.744 --> 22:28.907
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.841
Why are you here?

22:31.083 --> 22:34.211
I've been calling,
but I had your number wrong.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.718
When I got the right one,
there was no answer.

22:37.956 --> 22:42.393
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

22:42.594 --> 22:43.652
I'm okay.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.523
Maybe we could get together later?

22:47.032 --> 22:51.366
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.798
You got it.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.903
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.

22:57.576 --> 23:00.477
-There you go.
-Second date.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.010
I don't know.

23:02.647 --> 23:03.773
You don't know?

23:03.982 --> 23:07.577
She seems nice, but her coming
all the way here...

23:07.819 --> 23:12.415
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
