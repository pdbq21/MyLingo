WEBVTT

00:03.770 --> 00:07.831
I got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.

00:08.041 --> 00:12.341
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

00:12.612 --> 00:17.675
You are definitely the hottie
of the Paleontology Department. "

00:19.119 --> 00:23.351
"Hotties of Paleontology. "
There's a big-selling calendar.

00:24.891 --> 00:28.588
- Who wrote it?
- The evaluations are all anonymous.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.854
- You have their exams?
- Yeah.

00:31.064 --> 00:35.398
You could just match the handwriting
and there's your admirer.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.965
A hot girl's at stake
and he's Rain Man.

00:41.741 --> 00:45.734
Wait a minute. Why are we
so sure that this is a girl?

00:50.083 --> 00:51.414
It's a girl!

00:52.318 --> 00:53.979
But it wouldn't matter.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.587
Because I'm a teacher.
She's a student.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.157
- It's illegal?
- It's frowned upon.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.624
- And there's a big age gap.
- When you're 90..

01:03.897 --> 01:08.231
I know, she'll be 80 and it won't
seem like such a big difference.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.227
That's not what I was gonna say.

01:13.907 --> 01:18.776
When you're 90, you'll still have the
memory of being with a 20-year-old.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.275
The One Where Ross Dates A Student

01:59.119 --> 02:02.350
- Monica..?
- I don't know.

02:03.223 --> 02:07.182
You know your college friend
who became a movie director?

02:07.427 --> 02:10.919
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

02:11.564 --> 02:16.627
- What's a movement class?
- He's pretending he didn't take mime.

02:17.303 --> 02:22.104
She's directing a new Al Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.572
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.644
Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

02:27.914 --> 02:31.042
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3000..

02:31.284 --> 02:34.947
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing
the subject? What?

02:35.255 --> 02:38.088
- Will you make the call?
- Okay, I'll try.

02:38.324 --> 02:43.489
Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.460
Remember Thursday.
Remember Thursday?

02:47.634 --> 02:49.226
Yeah, so Tuesday?

02:50.770 --> 02:52.533
Thursday!

02:52.772 --> 02:57.641
Just think of it like this:
The third day. Monday, one day.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.844
Tuesday, two day.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.273
Wednesday...
When day, what day?

03:02.482 --> 03:03.676
Thursday!

03:03.983 --> 03:06.508
The third day, okay?

03:07.754 --> 03:09.278
- Thank you.
- Okay.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.922
- Hey, Monica..?
- She doesn't know.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.389
- I'm gonna check my messages.
- You thought of that in there?

03:19.632 --> 03:23.432
Nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.135
Hello?

03:28.174 --> 03:29.334
Rachel.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.874
Someone's in our apartment.
Call the cops!

03:32.145 --> 03:33.635
You're on the phone!

03:34.647 --> 03:37.207
- Oh, my God!
- What?

03:37.417 --> 03:38.884
Oh, my God! Thank you!

03:39.085 --> 03:41.315
There was a fire at our place.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.981
- Oh, my God! How bad was it?
- It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.027
- Come on, we gotta go!
- Yeah, come on.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.661
What are you smiling about?

03:54.167 --> 03:59.469
The part I want to audition for is
a fireman. This is so meant to be!

04:07.046 --> 04:11.346
You were very generous
with your grades this semester.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.282
- Professor Geller?
- Yeah?

04:20.360 --> 04:25.627
- I really enjoyed your class.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks very much.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.260
I'm a little embarrassed about
calling you a hottie.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.598
- That was you?
- Yeah.

04:32.805 --> 04:37.708
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.942
Want to go out sometime?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.912
That's not the best idea.

04:44.117 --> 04:48.110
Oh, because I was thinking,
the semester's over.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.950
- You're not my teacher anymore.
- What time?

04:53.393 --> 04:55.588
Oh, you know what? Forget it.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.263
I see you already gave me an A.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.965
- Gotcha.
- I'm kidding! God!

05:03.970 --> 05:06.268
So seriously, what time?

05:10.476 --> 05:13.775
Coming through. Coming through.
Oh! Hello. Hi.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.279
Right. Coming through!

05:16.849 --> 05:18.578
Okay. It's not so bad.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.083
Most of the damage
was contained to the bedrooms.

05:22.288 --> 05:26.224
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

05:26.426 --> 05:29.361
- Excuse me?
- Joey! He's working.

05:29.862 --> 05:32.023
You would look good in that.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.994
Oh, how bad is it?

05:35.201 --> 05:36.668
It's really bad.

05:36.869 --> 05:41.863
The only thing that isn't burned is an
ax, which I do not remember buying.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.007
- How's your room?
- Everything's ruined.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.645
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.575
Isn't that mine?

05:49.816 --> 05:52.376
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

05:53.786 --> 05:58.314
You won't be able to live here for
a while. You have a place to stay?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.855
Oh! Wow!

06:00.059 --> 06:02.994
Okay, look, pal...

06:03.463 --> 06:06.489
I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.999
But if you give me your number,
I'll call you sometime.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.364
Yes, they can stay with us.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.941
Do you know what
started the fire, Mr. Fireman?

06:18.644 --> 06:20.703
Well, do either of you smoke?

06:20.913 --> 06:24.246
No. But yeah,
I could use one now. Thanks.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.180
- Do you light candles, burn incense?
- I do all the time. I love them!

06:30.556 --> 06:34.720
Oh, my God, I did it! It's me,
it's me! I burned down the house!

06:34.927 --> 06:39.227
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

06:39.532 --> 06:41.762
I warned her about those candles.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.034
I can't believe how long it's been.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.176
Hey, Chandler, is that..?

06:53.613 --> 06:57.049
- Oh, that's great, good for you.
- So, is it..?

06:58.718 --> 07:03.212
Okay. So, yeah, maybe
we can get together...

07:08.161 --> 07:10.061
Hold on for one second.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.491
What?

07:11.697 --> 07:14.962
Do you want to get a pizza later?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.834
Hi, I'm back.

07:17.637 --> 07:21.198
Yeah, that sounds great.
We'll do it then. Okay, bye.

07:24.777 --> 07:29.214
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

07:29.649 --> 07:31.514
Hi. We didn't get to it.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.208
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.114
Now you're going on a date
with this girl?

07:37.323 --> 07:39.348
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.822
You can't just call up
and ask somebody for a favor.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.895
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.326
Right, I'm sorry.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.034
- It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
- We only went out once.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.895
You dated her?!

07:54.040 --> 07:55.667
Not once.

07:57.143 --> 08:01.375
Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

08:01.581 --> 08:04.880
You want to do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.693
That's great. My friend Joey's
in the movie business.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.730
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.324
My friend's name is Joey.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.267
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.599
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
if he can edit my new movie.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.207
Can you believe that?

08:31.410 --> 08:34.243
You know, I haven't spoken to him
in 10 years...

08:34.447 --> 08:37.109
and he asks me for a favor?

08:39.619 --> 08:41.917
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.088
No "How you doing?"

08:45.358 --> 08:48.418
Man, I mean, not even
a cup of coffee first.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.459
- The nerve.
- Yeah.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.027
Refill?

08:53.799 --> 08:57.132
This is last-minute, so I want
to apologize for the mess.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.928
Oh, who cares?

09:01.974 --> 09:05.774
Oh, my God! It sure didn't look
this way when I lived here.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.377
I know!

09:09.282 --> 09:13.616
But there's only room for one, so one
of you will have to stay at Joey's.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.880
Since the fire was kind of my fault,
you should get to stay here.

09:19.158 --> 09:23.117
Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
fault. It was an accident.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.830
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.656
Okay!

09:28.834 --> 09:30.893
You're the first guest
at "Hotel Monica. "

09:31.137 --> 09:32.161
Hotel Monica!

09:32.438 --> 09:34.429
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.074
I thought I'd bring them
to you in bed.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.642
- You've been through so much.
- I have.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.316
This right here is where
I keep the pizza.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.812
And that's where the napkin is.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.019
- What's that smell?
- I know! I don't...

09:55.428 --> 09:59.922
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

10:00.132 --> 10:04.432
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson. "

10:04.670 --> 10:05.659
Who?

10:05.938 --> 10:09.840
Oh. I had trouble remembering names,
so I came up with nicknames.

10:10.109 --> 10:14.102
The guy on the other side of you
was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt. "

10:14.647 --> 10:16.444
Oh, yeah.

10:17.783 --> 10:22.220
- So did you have a nickname for me?
- No. No.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.479
Yes, you did. What was it?

10:27.493 --> 10:28.858
"Cutie McPretty. "

10:29.128 --> 10:32.029
Oh, that's so sweet!

10:33.332 --> 10:36.426
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.538
You said it might be weird,
the whole student/teacher thing?

10:40.740 --> 10:43.538
And to be frank,
I thought it would be too.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.073
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.081
- Dr. Geller!
- Burt!

10:55.588 --> 10:58.352
- Did you sleep well last night?
- I did.

10:58.557 --> 11:02.049
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.527
Know what Joey left on my pillow?

11:04.730 --> 11:05.890
Gum.

11:06.766 --> 11:11.897
- We determined the cause of the fire.
- I know. It was my candle, my candle!

11:12.938 --> 11:16.897
No, there was an appliance left on.
It looks like a curling iron.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.576
- I don't use a curling iron.
- Someone does.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.709
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.517
- It could've been a hair straightener.
- Oh.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.882
This is where I keep the pizza.

11:32.758 --> 11:35.226
And..
Hey, where'd the napkin go?

11:37.463 --> 11:39.021
What is that?

11:39.732 --> 11:41.700
Is that old shrimp?

11:43.636 --> 11:46.070
I think it is!

11:51.610 --> 11:54.602
I wouldn't want my best guest
to strain her eyes.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.644
Thanks, Monica.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.151
- Does that smell bother you?
- From Joey's?

12:00.319 --> 12:02.253
I can hardly smell it over here.

12:03.122 --> 12:07.456
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.425
- I can smell it a little, bake a pie.
- Okay.

12:15.634 --> 12:16.828
Hello?

12:17.069 --> 12:19.902
One minute, please.
It's the fire inspector.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.665
Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.265
Really?

12:25.478 --> 12:29.346
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
the hair straightener...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.311
that started the fire.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.915
No, no. It was the candles.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.487
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

12:37.757 --> 12:42.353
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is...

12:46.699 --> 12:48.860
okay, well I have to go now.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.839
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.875
I thought the age difference might be
a problem, but it wasn't.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.445
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

13:08.154 --> 13:11.123
A concept lost on some people.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.949
It's okay to date a student?

13:13.159 --> 13:17.061
Well, not really. Technically,
it's not against the rules.

13:17.296 --> 13:21.289
But it's frowned upon, especially by
the professor we saw last night:

13:21.567 --> 13:23.501
"Judgy Von Holier-than-thou. "

13:26.505 --> 13:31.499
You don't want to get a reputation
as "Professor McNails-his-students. "

13:34.380 --> 13:37.838
- Yeah. What should I do?
- Well, it seems pretty clear.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.313
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?

13:41.587 --> 13:45.023
- You gotta follow your heart.
- Joey, that's so sweet.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.729
- Hi.
- Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?

13:52.932 --> 13:56.595
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open? Say, Thursday?

13:57.036 --> 13:59.197
- I couldn't do it.
- You couldn't do it?

13:59.405 --> 14:01.873
I need more time.
We're going to dinner.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.938
You're going out with her again?

14:05.744 --> 14:08.838
- Going out with who?
- Dana Keystone, from college.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.744
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she...?

14:13.586 --> 14:14.951
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.518
Oh.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.784
- Joey, you didn't even know her!
- Yeah, whatever.

14:25.564 --> 14:26.758
Great story again.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.900
The yarns that you weave!

14:32.037 --> 14:34.904
You know, actually, I should get going.

14:35.107 --> 14:39.100
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.

14:42.248 --> 14:45.081
Oh, I am really flattered.

14:45.284 --> 14:49.721
But I just...
I don't feel that way about you.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.381
Oh, no, no. That's not..

14:52.591 --> 14:56.220
I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you're such a sweet guy...

14:56.428 --> 14:58.589
and I don't want to hurt you.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.925
I wish I could do something
to make you feel better.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.261
No.. Really?

15:04.803 --> 15:06.065
Of course.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.267
Well, it just hurts so bad, I...

15:10.009 --> 15:12.273
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:12.478 --> 15:16.915
- Maybe there is one thing you can do.
- What? Anything. Anything.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.950
Well, I mean, this is just
off the top of my head now.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.914
But I have this friend..
This actor friend.

15:25.157 --> 15:28.251
He would kill me if he knew
that I was doing this.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.086
But...

15:31.597 --> 15:36.694
would it be possible for him to
audition for your movie on Thursday?

15:37.836 --> 15:39.303
Absolutely.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.766
But...

15:41.006 --> 15:45.943
you'd really feel better if your
friend could audition for my movie?

15:46.178 --> 15:48.305
The heart wants what it wants. Bye.

15:55.554 --> 15:58.022
Hey! How's it going?

15:58.223 --> 16:01.317
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.659
Yes, it has. I made cookies!

16:03.862 --> 16:06.831
I'm still full from your
homemade potato chips.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.159
But you should eat them now,
because they're hot from the oven.

16:12.538 --> 16:13.527
Okay.

16:13.739 --> 16:18.233
But not in here! Can't eat them
in bed, remember? No crumbies!

16:18.477 --> 16:21.674
Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.904
Okay.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.218
- What are you doing?
- This doesn't lock, does it?

16:40.265 --> 16:44.827
- Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
- It's all right, don't worry about it.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.504
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.

16:47.740 --> 16:51.267
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.575
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.009
Yeah.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.350
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.192
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

17:16.568 --> 17:19.196
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?

17:19.438 --> 17:20.427
I can't.

17:20.639 --> 17:25.235
- Oh, you have some studying to do?
- No, I have some turning 21 to do.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.948
You know, I remember when I was
in college, we used to..

17:33.318 --> 17:37.755
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.553
Do you not want to be seen with me?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.230
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

17:47.433 --> 17:50.561
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.397
What? No, no, wait, wait..

17:53.972 --> 17:57.408
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

17:57.676 --> 17:59.644
I mean, we like each other, right?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.745
There's nothing wrong with that.

18:02.781 --> 18:03.805
Come on.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.921
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.525
- This is Elizabeth.
- Hi.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.193
Aren't you in my popular culture
class?

18:17.463 --> 18:19.897
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.828
And we're dating.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.161
And you may frown upon that but...

18:25.370 --> 18:27.804
we're not gonna hide it anymore.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.541
You are so fired.

18:33.512 --> 18:34.945
- What?
- They'll fire you.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.705
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.544
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

18:45.557 --> 18:48.025
I love it at Joey's!

18:51.830 --> 18:53.195
- Nice!
- Thanks.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.729
So you busy Thursday?

18:55.200 --> 18:59.899
Oh, very funny. Remember?
My audition was supposed to be Thursday.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.511
You got me the audition?
Let's hug it up!

19:06.712 --> 19:10.978
Okay, okay! What are you
gonna do to me if you get the part?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.312
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.045
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.587
I know they said the hair straightener
started the fire.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.850
But I think I'm partly at fault.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.586
You see, I didn't tell you, but...

19:25.864 --> 19:28.526
I had recently refilled
the tissues.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.429
And so, let's face it,
that's just kindling.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.706
So I think it's fair that
I stay at Joey's.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.671
No, no, no, this was my fault.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.344
- Besides, I'm fine here.
- Okay.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.510
- Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
- Really?

19:43.749 --> 19:48.083
- She said something about crumbies.
- No, no, no! I was so careful.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.086
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

19:53.292 --> 19:57.251
That's right. All the ladies
want to stay at Joey's.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.865
No, I don't want to switch.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.761
Please! I can throw
wet paper towels here!

20:03.969 --> 20:07.461
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.709
I know. I'm sorry.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.935
All right, fine.

20:14.479 --> 20:19.143
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.216
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

20:28.427 --> 20:32.727
I can't date you or have
a hot plate in my office.

20:34.633 --> 20:38.125
I can't believe we have
to stop seeing each other.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.967
For what it's worth, I did appreciate
you standing up for me.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.070
That felt really nice.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.837
Kind of made me like you even more.

20:49.081 --> 20:53.279
I know, I know. I really like
you too. But we can't date.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.918
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.321
- Wow.
- What?

20:59.524 --> 21:03.187
Just hearing you describe it
as "forbidden"...

21:03.428 --> 21:05.020
it's really hot.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.364
Really?

21:09.301 --> 21:10.700
Yeah.

21:11.603 --> 21:16.131
Well, I don't care how hot it is,
it's wrong.

21:17.876 --> 21:21.505
- Stop it.
- No, no. It's wrong.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.437
It's naughty.

21:24.716 --> 21:25.876
It's...

21:26.785 --> 21:28.184
taboo.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.545
Shut the book.

21:32.224 --> 21:35.489
Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.187
Hey.

21:41.566 --> 21:42.624
Hey.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.564
- So?
- So...?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.867
It's Thursday!
How was the audition?

21:48.073 --> 21:52.305
It's.. Monday, one day. Tuesday,
two day. Wednesday, what day..

21:54.746 --> 21:55.735
Oh!
