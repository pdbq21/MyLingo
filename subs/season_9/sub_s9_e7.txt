WEBVTT

00:04.041 --> 00:07.241
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says..

00:07.715 --> 00:11.484
we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.

00:11.690 --> 00:15.493
Yes, we were.
Come here, gorgeous.

00:16.833 --> 00:20.328
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.

00:20.508 --> 00:24.345
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got..

00:24.516 --> 00:26.509
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.821
Yes, you do. And a..
And a big, round belly.

00:31.128 --> 00:34.932
Big baby butt.

00:36.172 --> 00:38.507
I like big butts.

00:52.170 --> 00:56.042
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.

00:56.713 --> 00:59.479
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?

00:59.652 --> 01:03.318
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?

01:03.493 --> 01:07.058
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.267
What? What?
You wanna hear some more?

01:17.822 --> 01:20.919
I'm a terrible father.

02:09.491 --> 02:12.987
- What do you know about investments?
- How come?

02:13.165 --> 02:17.071
I'm starting to make good money on the
show, and I should do something with it.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.408
- What do you do with your money now?
- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

02:21.583 --> 02:25.717
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.

02:27.327 --> 02:30.128
- Do you have any ideas?
- A guy at work got me excited..

02:30.333 --> 02:33.464
about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?

02:33.707 --> 02:37.271
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

02:38.984 --> 02:42.583
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.090
Yeah. Right!

02:46.633 --> 02:48.796
People eat birds. Bird meat.

02:48.970 --> 02:52.465
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:

02:52.645 --> 02:55.811
"Excuse me, I'll have
a bucket of fried bird."

02:55.984 --> 02:59.115
Or maybe just a wing. Or a..

03:02.197 --> 03:04.691
You should consider something
a little less risky.

03:05.103 --> 03:07.335
I think real estate is
your best investment.

03:07.641 --> 03:12.845
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.420
That's right. I know some stuff.

03:15.624 --> 03:17.183
Real estate, huh?

03:17.427 --> 03:20.058
And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!

03:20.233 --> 03:24.139
And you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

03:24.642 --> 03:29.015
- My dad told me. They play golf together.
- Well, maybe I'll join them sometime.

03:29.184 --> 03:31.849
I just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand..

03:32.023 --> 03:35.257
and beat the mustache
off his face.

03:41.943 --> 03:45.906
And then the doctor said Emma
has doubled her birth weight..

03:46.084 --> 03:50.457
she is in the 90th percentile and she's
gonna start eating solid foods soon.

03:50.627 --> 03:53.325
- That's great!
- I know!

03:53.967 --> 03:56.301
- What did we used to talk about?
- No idea.

03:58.375 --> 04:02.680
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

04:03.018 --> 04:05.717
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
That's a big step.

04:06.091 --> 04:10.726
- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
- They'll love you. Just be yourself.

04:10.968 --> 04:13.667
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.367
Yeah, she can't be herself.

04:16.546 --> 04:19.575
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

04:24.094 --> 04:27.225
- You can say neither.
- Oh, God. Neither.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.802
You can say it nicely.

04:29.972 --> 04:32.465
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.

04:32.645 --> 04:36.243
You are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.

04:36.451 --> 04:39.947
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.

04:40.126 --> 04:44.294
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where Wallace gets his good looks."

04:44.467 --> 04:48.841
- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
- He took the SATs for me.

04:49.779 --> 04:54.812
- I knew you didn't get a 1400!
- Yeah, well, duh! I mean..

04:55.156 --> 04:57.525
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

04:57.728 --> 05:02.066
Well, with the mother, just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.

05:02.236 --> 05:05.903
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said..

05:06.078 --> 05:09.016
I am like the daughter
that she never had.

05:12.056 --> 05:17.728
- She said what?
- She's like the daughter she never had.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.928
Listen.

05:29.925 --> 05:32.658
I just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.131
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.431
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

05:37.975 --> 05:40.343
You what? And I missed it..

05:40.514 --> 05:44.180
because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?!

05:44.955 --> 05:49.157
Yeah, and it was like
a real little person laugh too.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.129
It was like:

05:57.815 --> 06:01.151
Only not creepy.

06:01.321 --> 06:04.624
- What did you do to make her laugh?
- I..

06:04.795 --> 06:07.459
Well, I sang. Actually..

06:07.634 --> 06:10.196
I rapped..

06:10.507 --> 06:11.736
"Baby Got Back."

06:13.880 --> 06:15.679
You what?

06:15.884 --> 06:19.220
You sang to our baby daughter..

06:19.390 --> 06:22.362
a song about a guy
who likes to have sex..

06:22.531 --> 06:25.058
with women with giant asses?

06:25.236 --> 06:27.263
You know what,
if you think about it..

06:27.473 --> 06:31.881
it actually promotes
a healthy body image..

06:32.049 --> 06:34.417
because even big butts..

06:34.588 --> 06:37.890
or "juicy doubles" are..

06:42.403 --> 06:44.931
Please don't take her away from me.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.988
Hi, come on in.
I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.720
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

06:55.897 --> 06:59.632
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?

06:59.805 --> 07:03.575
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?

07:05.082 --> 07:08.920
He's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park..

07:09.090 --> 07:10.650
That's enough out of you.

07:10.827 --> 07:13.526
Is there anything we should know
about the place?

07:13.700 --> 07:18.198
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

07:18.375 --> 07:22.578
I think you guys would be
very happy here.

07:28.195 --> 07:31.326
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.530
- Okay. Sorry.
- That's all right.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.908
Wow, you seemed
pretty insulted by that.

07:38.382 --> 07:40.649
What, I'm not good enough for you?

07:41.822 --> 07:45.317
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.

07:45.496 --> 07:49.027
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

07:49.203 --> 07:52.938
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.

07:53.145 --> 07:55.411
When we know
all he does is sit around..

07:55.583 --> 07:59.249
crying about losing Monica
to a real man.

07:59.424 --> 08:02.225
- You don't think he's here, do you?
- I don't know.

08:02.396 --> 08:07.464
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.576
Well, let me see.

08:16.592 --> 08:18.892
Yeah, I can see it.

08:19.698 --> 08:23.228
Look at these videos.
I mean, who does he think he is?

08:23.405 --> 08:26.936
Magnum Force, Dirty Harry,
Cool Hand Luke.

08:27.113 --> 08:28.776
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:29.417 --> 08:32.321
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.

08:32.490 --> 08:36.487
A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.168
Wait a minute.

08:39.337 --> 08:41.638
This says "Monica."

08:42.878 --> 08:46.146
And this is Richard's apartment.

08:48.155 --> 08:49.487
Get there faster!

09:06.826 --> 09:08.887
Wow. You look..

09:09.497 --> 09:10.932
like my mom.

09:12.403 --> 09:15.102
I'm wearing pantyhose.

09:16.344 --> 09:18.508
- Great! Come on in.
- Okay.

09:22.089 --> 09:24.457
Thank you.

09:24.728 --> 09:27.894
- Oh, my God. You're rich.
- No, my parents are rich.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.530
Well, so? They gotta die someday.
Hello!

09:31.742 --> 09:33.370
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

09:33.546 --> 09:36.312
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.

09:36.484 --> 09:37.976
Theodore, Bitsy..

09:39.892 --> 09:42.260
what a delight.

09:43.131 --> 09:46.662
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- And you.

09:46.872 --> 09:49.172
Your home is lovely.

09:49.778 --> 09:53.239
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.

09:53.451 --> 09:55.284
Holy crap!

09:57.126 --> 09:59.962
Why don't you come meet our friends.

10:00.299 --> 10:02.269
Try and stop me.

10:02.436 --> 10:06.103
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get your parents to like me.

10:06.277 --> 10:08.976
I'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.917
I want them to get to know Phoebe,
not "Phoebe."

10:12.724 --> 10:15.560
It is fun, though, isn't it?

10:16.097 --> 10:18.192
- You've got it.
- All right.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.395
It's hard to stop.

10:21.407 --> 10:22.967
Well, come on.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.640
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.

10:26.819 --> 10:30.451
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

10:30.627 --> 10:33.325
- So where are you from?
- Okay.

10:33.532 --> 10:37.062
Well, all right.
Originally, I'm from upstate..

10:37.239 --> 10:41.647
but then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.

10:41.815 --> 10:46.381
So I moved to the city, where I lived in
a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.721
Which was okay. That was okay.

10:48.963 --> 10:51.594
Until I got hepatitis, you know..

10:51.769 --> 10:54.331
because this pimp spit
in my mouth and..

10:55.777 --> 10:57.211
But I got over it.

10:57.379 --> 11:02.378
And, anyway, now I'm
a freelance massage therapist..

11:02.557 --> 11:06.930
which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.

11:14.413 --> 11:16.611
So where does everyone summer?

11:20.292 --> 11:24.096
I'm not gonna watch it.
I don't need to watch it.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.965
I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

11:28.843 --> 11:31.006
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

11:32.216 --> 11:35.951
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Don't judge me! I'm only human!

11:36.759 --> 11:38.159
Did you take that tape?

11:38.328 --> 11:41.927
I had to! Imagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife..

11:42.102 --> 11:45.507
in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?

11:45.676 --> 11:48.476
I don't know. Who am I married to?

11:50.185 --> 11:51.677
Some girl.

11:51.855 --> 11:53.153
She hot?

11:55.295 --> 11:57.231
How did she get me to settle down?

11:58.903 --> 12:00.702
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

12:00.873 --> 12:03.743
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.

12:03.913 --> 12:08.115
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

12:08.288 --> 12:10.623
Can it?

12:11.060 --> 12:14.464
In my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped..

12:14.634 --> 12:17.230
she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.

12:19.678 --> 12:21.944
- Then you have to watch it for me.
- What?

12:22.115 --> 12:24.780
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?

12:26.224 --> 12:29.458
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

12:35.743 --> 12:39.273
- Why am I hearing cheering?
- It's okay. It's just a football game.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.718
- It's just football?
- You were all worried for nothing.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.795
It's football! It's just football!

12:45.963 --> 12:49.094
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!

12:49.270 --> 12:51.833
I think it may be customary to get a beer.

12:53.712 --> 12:55.579
What the..?

12:57.887 --> 13:00.483
- What are you doing?
- You don't wanna see what I just saw!

13:01.995 --> 13:03.988
What are you guys doing?

13:04.166 --> 13:07.104
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

13:12.249 --> 13:16.314
- Oh, God, this is not going well.
- No, you're doing fine. Really.

13:16.490 --> 13:20.089
- Why don't you go talk to my dad.
- Okay, okay, okay.

13:20.265 --> 13:22.828
- Still sure about me being myself?
- Absolutely.

13:23.004 --> 13:25.372
Though maybe just
a little less "pimp spit."

13:30.953 --> 13:35.223
So, Theodore, I can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.

13:36.330 --> 13:37.663
Well..

13:37.900 --> 13:42.638
- You must work out all the time.
- Not all the time. I do the best I can.

13:42.810 --> 13:45.246
Yeah, I bet. Look out!

13:45.750 --> 13:49.120
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- I recently had surgery.

13:49.658 --> 13:52.094
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'll be fine.

13:52.262 --> 13:55.325
- I just should check the stitches.
- I really am sorry.

13:55.503 --> 13:59.568
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?

14:02.049 --> 14:04.714
Did you just hit my dad?

14:04.888 --> 14:08.953
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

14:09.129 --> 14:11.794
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?

14:12.335 --> 14:14.271
Why don't you go talk to my mom.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.811
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

14:17.980 --> 14:22.854
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

14:24.460 --> 14:28.834
Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank you
again for having me here tonight.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.231
Well, not at all.

14:30.405 --> 14:34.004
Also, I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.

14:34.179 --> 14:38.746
- Thank you. I think so too.
- It's a testament to how he was raised.

14:38.922 --> 14:41.951
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.

14:42.129 --> 14:45.933
- Is he really?
- He is so considerate of my feelings.

14:46.103 --> 14:51.102
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.

14:54.988 --> 14:56.958
Excuse me?

14:57.125 --> 15:00.656
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.666
When he gets going..

15:02.837 --> 15:06.971
he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

15:09.249 --> 15:12.119
That's.. my boy.

15:19.036 --> 15:20.163
Awesome.

15:23.277 --> 15:27.274
Okay, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?

15:27.520 --> 15:28.749
Please laugh for Mommy.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.602
Not funny, huh?

15:35.769 --> 15:37.739
Well, so is it..

15:37.907 --> 15:41.904
only offensive novelty rap?

15:42.115 --> 15:45.953
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.

15:52.335 --> 15:54.932
I can't rap.

15:56.745 --> 16:01.847
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because I love you so much.

16:02.155 --> 16:06.688
And I know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.

16:39.697 --> 16:42.361
Emma, you're laughing! You are!

16:42.536 --> 16:47.204
You really do like big butts, don't you?

16:47.379 --> 16:51.342
You beautiful little weirdo.

16:52.288 --> 16:55.260
You missed it! She was laughing!

16:55.428 --> 16:56.727
It was amazing.

16:57.098 --> 17:01.163
It was amazing. It was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.

17:01.373 --> 17:04.869
I know, isn't it?
What'd you do to get her to laugh?

17:06.918 --> 17:10.220
You know, I just..
A couple of things I tried. Different..

17:10.391 --> 17:12.760
Just sang a little
"The Itsy-Bitsy Spider."

17:13.932 --> 17:16.631
You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?

17:16.971 --> 17:21.309
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!

17:22.583 --> 17:25.987
And then it goes back to the chorus.

17:29.162 --> 17:32.293
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.

17:33.939 --> 17:37.002
I realize you hadn't asked
to hear it..

17:37.178 --> 17:39.741
but no one had spoken
in 17 minutes.

17:40.986 --> 17:45.860
Phoebe writes lots of songs. What was
that one you sang the other night?

17:46.497 --> 17:47.761
"Pervert Parade"?

17:50.271 --> 17:53.767
- "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?
- Stop.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.849
Oh, God. Is that veal?

18:00.091 --> 18:03.553
Mom, I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.

18:03.798 --> 18:07.704
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian..

18:07.873 --> 18:11.506
except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal I love.

18:11.714 --> 18:16.314
- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

18:17.091 --> 18:19.186
But, you know, especially veal.

18:19.530 --> 18:23.401
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.

18:38.568 --> 18:40.731
Yummy.

18:51.426 --> 18:52.986
So..

18:53.765 --> 18:55.131
what do you think?

18:59.009 --> 19:01.537
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?

19:02.616 --> 19:05.554
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!

19:06.924 --> 19:10.328
That tape was never meant
to be seen by..

19:10.498 --> 19:14.404
Joey, I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.

19:14.573 --> 19:19.675
Monica, look, I don't think you and I
have any secrets anymore.

19:20.752 --> 19:23.314
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.

19:23.725 --> 19:27.529
Why in the world would you take this tape?
And why would you watch it?

19:27.700 --> 19:30.068
Because that's who I am. Okay?

19:30.706 --> 19:34.440
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.

19:34.613 --> 19:37.015
It'd just be another saucy anecdote..

19:37.185 --> 19:41.353
for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.

19:42.028 --> 19:45.432
Is all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?

19:46.436 --> 19:49.408
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

19:49.577 --> 19:52.412
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

19:52.583 --> 19:56.317
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?

19:56.524 --> 19:58.994
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.

19:59.162 --> 20:01.963
Yeah, well, poor Richard, he..

20:02.135 --> 20:04.332
I can grow a mustache.

20:05.609 --> 20:10.482
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.

20:11.052 --> 20:15.824
But I just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your..

20:15.996 --> 20:17.863
cowboy boots in the air.

20:18.968 --> 20:23.774
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.

20:23.978 --> 20:27.280
Good, good. Play more
because I wanna see how it ends.

20:28.153 --> 20:32.457
- That's not me!
- What?

20:32.863 --> 20:35.960
That's not you! Life is good again!

20:36.804 --> 20:39.400
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

20:40.010 --> 20:43.471
That bastard taped over me!

20:45.354 --> 20:47.552
Is that a problem?

20:48.026 --> 20:51.989
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

20:53.203 --> 20:57.143
Yes, but the important thing is
that we have each other, right?

20:57.311 --> 21:00.249
Well, yeah. It's just so rude!

21:01.721 --> 21:06.891
- And the way we did it was a lot better..
- Are you going to finish that sentence?

21:07.699 --> 21:09.862
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

21:10.037 --> 21:13.636
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.

21:15.515 --> 21:16.540
Hello, dear.

21:18.053 --> 21:21.025
- What's going on?
- We were just chitchatting.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.959
- How's your friend?
- A little better.

21:24.332 --> 21:28.740
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

21:28.975 --> 21:33.508
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

21:33.718 --> 21:37.818
- I'm not interested.
- Please, darling, let's be honest.

21:37.993 --> 21:41.990
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.229
- But let's be real.
- All right, stop.

21:44.405 --> 21:48.904
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear..

21:49.115 --> 21:50.607
but she did her best.

21:50.785 --> 21:55.750
- She's a little different than you are.
- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.936
So what? If I can get past that,
it shouldn't bother you.

22:01.106 --> 22:04.306
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.

22:04.513 --> 22:06.949
If you can't even be civil
to the woman I love..

22:07.118 --> 22:11.024
- The woman you what?
- Yeah, the woman you what?

22:13.230 --> 22:15.029
The woman I love.

22:19.610 --> 22:20.942
I love you.

22:22.783 --> 22:27.451
Something I shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents..

22:27.626 --> 22:29.789
and Tom and Sue.

22:29.963 --> 22:35.601
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people I've ever met in my life.

22:37.713 --> 22:40.081
- I love you too.
- You do?

22:42.121 --> 22:43.681
How great is this?

22:47.498 --> 22:49.024
Wanna get out of here?

22:49.536 --> 22:53.806
- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
- I had a great time.

22:53.978 --> 22:58.078
It was really top-drawer.
And here's something rich.

22:58.253 --> 23:02.627
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.

23:02.829 --> 23:04.024
Ta-ta!

23:26.209 --> 23:28.145
One more time from the top!

23:35.695 --> 23:38.724
Rachel, please!
That is so inappropriate!
