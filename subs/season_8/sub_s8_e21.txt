WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:04.468
-Hey. I got some bad news.
-What?

00:04.705 --> 00:09.972
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"

00:10.310 --> 00:14.371
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the Post.

00:15.849 --> 00:20.980
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran
around and bought all the copies.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.854
Two, four, six, one million.
Yeah, you got them all.

00:25.726 --> 00:29.457
This is bad.
And I've had bad reviews.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.664
I remember my first good one:

00:31.832 --> 00:34.892
"Everything else in Our Town
was terrible.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.060
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."

00:41.608 --> 00:44.406
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.511
It must be a good review. Is it great?

00:52.653 --> 00:53.881
Oh, dear God.

00:54.087 --> 00:59.525
But the good news is, no one
in a two-block radius will ever know.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.924
-And the rest of Manhattan?
-They all know.

01:03.697 --> 01:07.895
Oh, my God, this is horrible.
I'm so humiliated.

01:08.101 --> 01:11.662
They say there's no such thing
as bad press.

01:11.872 --> 01:17.276
You don't think that "the mahi-mahi
was awful-awful" is bad press?

01:19.212 --> 01:21.237
I didn't write it.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.309
-God, is he right? Am I awful?
-Oh, no!

01:25.552 --> 01:27.110
Monica, listen to me.

01:27.287 --> 01:30.654
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend.

01:30.824 --> 01:34.089
Your food is abysmal!

02:16.570 --> 02:19.505
-Ross?
-What? What?

02:19.673 --> 02:23.336
-I am freaking out!
-Are you?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.038
My due date is in one week!

02:26.213 --> 02:29.148
-What are you doing up?
-That is seven days.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.479
I had a lot of water.
Can we do this after..?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.449
No, no, no, no, Ross!

02:34.621 --> 02:37.351
We don't have any big stuff we need.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.857
We don't have a changing table or a crib.

02:41.061 --> 02:45.862
-We do not have a diaper service.
-Funny you should mention diapers.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.268
-I'm serious.
-There's nothing to worry about.

02:50.437 --> 02:54.464
There's a baby store on West 10th.
We'll go there..

02:54.641 --> 02:59.271
-and get everything we need. Okay?
-Okay. Thank you. That's great.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.506
Where on West 10th?
There's a shoe store..

03:02.816 --> 03:07.344
Okay. If you're gonna do this,
then I'm gonna go do that, so..

03:07.821 --> 03:11.222
-Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
-Yeah.

03:11.425 --> 03:15.486
Our situation, you know,
what we mean to each other..

03:15.729 --> 03:21.190
and, I mean, we're having this baby
together and we live together..

03:21.368 --> 03:24.769
Isn't that..? Isn't that weird?

03:30.243 --> 03:31.471
Well..

03:31.712 --> 03:34.476
I'm just kidding. You can go pee.

03:38.785 --> 03:42.551
Did we say we were gonna meet here
or at the movie?

03:42.789 --> 03:46.190
-We said at the movies, but..
-I'll see you there.

03:46.359 --> 03:51.160
-Now that you're here..?
-I'll hang out till I have to meet you.

03:51.498 --> 03:55.195
-How come you're not going?
-I've got a job interview.

03:55.402 --> 04:00.396
-I thought you already have a job.
-And they say you don't pay attention.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.442
It's a better job.
It's vice president of the company..

04:04.611 --> 04:08.547
that does data reconfiguration
for other companies.

04:10.050 --> 04:14.817
-Wow. How do you know how to do that?
-That's what I do now.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.252
-Joey? Come taste this.
-What?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.917
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well..

04:22.129 --> 04:25.098
I'm getting my revenge.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.558
You cooked him?

04:27.968 --> 04:31.597
No. He teaches a course
at The New School..

04:31.838 --> 04:35.137
I want to make him try
my bouillabaisse again.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.606
I can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

04:38.779 --> 04:43.546
"Restaurant reviewer admits:
'I was wrong about Monica.'"

04:43.884 --> 04:45.784
The front page?

04:45.952 --> 04:49.752
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?

04:50.690 --> 04:54.319
-I better get to my movie.
-Oh, yeah.

04:54.494 --> 04:57.429
If I'm going to the movie
and you're going to the movie..

04:57.597 --> 04:59.724
why don't we just go together?

05:00.400 --> 05:03.164
How's that for data reconfiguration,
huh, Chand?

05:10.577 --> 05:12.977
My name's Katie if there's
anything else you need.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.912
Oh, God, I don't know. I want.. Everything
is so great, I just want everything.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.950
Oh, look at this. We need this!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.849
-What is it?
-I don't know.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.552
Have you ever had two people
who weren't wearing crowns..

05:26.726 --> 05:28.091
spend this much money here?

05:28.261 --> 05:30.889
You have selected a lot of nice things.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.193
You want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?

05:34.367 --> 05:36.426
-Oh, no, no.
-No, no.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.503
-We're not married.
-We are having a baby..

05:39.773 --> 05:41.764
but we're not involved.

05:41.975 --> 05:46.207
I mean, we were seeing
each other a while ago..

05:46.379 --> 05:51.646
but then we were just friends, and
then there was one drunken night..

05:53.787 --> 05:57.746
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd like this delivered, please.

05:57.924 --> 06:01.121
-Can you fill out this address card?
-Oh, okay.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.663
-You picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
-Yeah.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.596
That's one of the reasons
why we're not a couple.

06:08.835 --> 06:11.429
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.971
Really? That is so cool.

06:14.207 --> 06:19.839
Don't get too worked up. It sounds
like he's a doctor, but he's not.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.504
No. I'm fascinated by paleontology.

06:22.682 --> 06:26.812
-Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
-I teach it in class.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.424
Standing at a cash register, I'm
holding a credit card, and I'm bored.

06:33.059 --> 06:37.393
I love your neighborhood.
There's a great gym around the corner.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.523
-That's my gym.
-I could tell you work out.

06:46.373 --> 06:51.106
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like Indiana Jones.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.247
I am like Indiana Jones.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.023
-Hi, Pheebs.
-Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

07:08.194 --> 07:10.788
Great! We got everything we needed.

07:10.964 --> 07:15.094
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.429
A whore.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.932
What?

07:19.439 --> 07:24.240
We were paying, and this sales
woman just started flirting with him.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.901
Can you believe that?

07:26.112 --> 07:30.310
-Did she know you two weren't married?
-Yeah.

07:30.483 --> 07:35.785
Oh, my God. Well, the idea..
A woman flirting with a single man?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.948
-We must alert the church elders.
-No.

07:39.759 --> 07:43.593
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.131
-Sounds like you're jealous.
-No, I'm not.

07:47.300 --> 07:51.396
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop..

07:51.571 --> 07:55.974
and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.634
Is that a real place?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.404
Are they hiring?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.577
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.581
Why so fancy?

08:09.789 --> 08:11.518
I got a job interview.

08:11.691 --> 08:15.593
It's more money, and I'd be doing
data reconfiguration.

08:15.795 --> 08:20.789
-I think I know someone who does that.
-Me. I do that.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.635
So do I look okay?
I'm nervous.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.828
Oh, yeah. You look great.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.274
You know, just don't
get your hopes up.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.309
-Why not?
-Well, the interview.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.945
-Yeah?
-You know.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.447
You don't make a very good
first impression.

08:37.817 --> 08:40.843
-What?
-Oh, you don't know.

08:41.621 --> 08:45.990
-Are you serious?
-When I first met you, you were like:

08:46.159 --> 08:49.287
I was like:

08:51.998 --> 08:53.795
What is it that I do?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.731
It's just, like, you're trying too hard,
making jokes..

08:57.937 --> 09:00.201
You come off a little needy.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.841
Did you like me when we first met?

09:03.176 --> 09:09.046
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But I am gonna run away from you.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.780
She's put on so much weight.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.124
There he is.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.559
That smug bastard.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.266
Okay, class.
We'll see you next time.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.060
There he is.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.533
Hi. I'm Monica Geller,
chef at Allessandro's.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.742
Still?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.177
The things you said were unfair..

09:42.382 --> 09:45.715
and I want you to try
my bouillabaisse again.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.854
I don't see why I'd do
that to myself again.

09:49.055 --> 09:52.024
Either eat it or be in it.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.886
Spoon?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.759
-What do you think?
-I'm torn..

10:01.935 --> 10:06.736
between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

10:06.906 --> 10:12.367
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.

10:13.480 --> 10:18.941
Thattagirl! We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.779
Welcome to lntroduction to Cooking.

10:21.955 --> 10:27.120
Can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and bearnaise sauce?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.489
-I can.
-Okay, go ahead.

10:30.730 --> 10:34.325
Well, they both have a egg yolk
and butter base.

10:34.501 --> 10:39.336
But a bearnaise has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.274
Very good. What's your name?

10:42.442 --> 10:46.469
-You go to the head of the class!
-Okay!

10:49.315 --> 10:51.840
This stuff takes up a lot of room.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.646
How serious are you about keeping
Ben in your life?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.655
My son? Pretty serious.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.467
Hi, Katie.
What are you doing here?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.466
The delivery went out
and they forgot this.

11:11.671 --> 11:17.303
It must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.

11:17.477 --> 11:23.541
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
aren't really part of my job description.

11:26.119 --> 11:30.783
Oh, I actually came here
to ask you out.

11:31.057 --> 11:35.357
Oh. Wow.
Yeah, that sounds great.

11:35.562 --> 11:41.990
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.762
I'm free now.
You want to get coffee..?

11:44.971 --> 11:48.668
-Sure.
-Horny bitch.

11:51.411 --> 11:55.643
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

11:55.815 --> 11:58.648
No, you're a horny bitch!

11:58.818 --> 12:00.979
You guys have a good time.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.850
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And my whip.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.625
You know, because of lndiana Jones.

12:11.297 --> 12:15.063
Not because I'm into S & M.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.166
I'm not into anything weird, you know?

12:18.338 --> 12:20.499
Just normal sex.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.472
So I'm gonna grab my coat.

12:30.383 --> 12:36.379
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.448
Are you okay with this?

12:39.659 --> 12:43.220
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.
You guys have fun.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.727
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.125
Nice to see you.

12:46.332 --> 12:50.735
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.

12:50.970 --> 12:54.963
-Although you missed a button.
-Oh, actually, I..

12:55.174 --> 12:57.870
Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing there.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.916
I can't even believe this.
I really come off that badly?

13:05.084 --> 13:07.882
It's okay. You calm down
after a while..

13:08.054 --> 13:11.421
and then people see
how wonderful you are.

13:11.658 --> 13:15.355
Good. Because I'm sure this
interview will last weeks.

13:15.561 --> 13:19.895
All right, don't freak out, okay?
I will help you.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.763
-How long before you have to leave?
-An hour.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.530
-I can't help you.
-Phoebe..

13:26.739 --> 13:32.200
We'll do our best. I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.

13:32.378 --> 13:36.474
-Okay.
-Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.483
-Chandler Bing.
-Oh, Bing.

13:39.686 --> 13:43.486
-What an unusual name.
-You should meet my Uncle Bada.

13:49.696 --> 13:52.290
I'll let myself out.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.666
Your alfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

14:01.874 --> 14:07.039
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.945
-And the cream?
-Cheese makes me thirsty.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.314
-Okay. Let's move on.
-All right.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.293
Something smells good
over at Monica's station.

14:22.328 --> 14:26.287
My God! This is amazing!
You've never made this before?

14:26.499 --> 14:30.196
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.

14:30.403 --> 14:35.272
I had to ask what it was called when
the water makes those bubbles.

14:36.008 --> 14:40.468
-Hats off to the chef.
-Your mouth was full. I didn't hear.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.671
-Hats off to who?
-The chef!

14:43.383 --> 14:45.214
That's right!

14:47.053 --> 14:52.685
You'll find that I don't micromanage.
I don't shy away from delegating.

14:52.859 --> 14:57.523
That's good to know. But let's stop
focusing on what you don't do..

14:57.697 --> 14:59.824
and focus on what you do do.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.401
What I do do..

15:07.640 --> 15:12.543
is create an atmosphere of support
for the people working with me.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.407
Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.278
-Hardest thing I've ever done.
-Oh, you gotta go!

15:19.719 --> 15:22.210
-Don't worry. You're ready.
-Really?

15:22.455 --> 15:27.916
Absolutely! Just fight all your
natural instincts, and you'll be great.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.426
Monica, check these out.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.323
Those look like cookies.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.559
I know, yeah.
And I made them all by myself.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.705
I mixed the ingredients,
I put them in the oven, I took them out.

15:39.872 --> 15:43.273
Granted, I should have used
the oven mitts, but still.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.869
Monica, my star student.

15:46.045 --> 15:51.312
You called me that before,
so I fashioned a star out of foil.

15:51.584 --> 15:55.884
Now, no pressure. If you like my
cookies, you give me the star.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.926
Wow, a star!

16:03.629 --> 16:07.929
I know you all hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.735
-Okay, Joey, you're up next.
-Yeah.

16:13.539 --> 16:16.667
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

16:16.843 --> 16:18.777
You get an A.

16:18.945 --> 16:23.644
I got an A? In school?
Hey, I'm a dork!

16:25.117 --> 16:27.210
Joey, I'm so proud of you.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.480
-I think you should give him your star.
-Excuse me?

16:32.091 --> 16:36.152
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Nobody knows what they're doing.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.559
I do. I'm a professional chef!

16:39.799 --> 16:42.791
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.836
Why are you taking
Introduction to Cooking?

16:46.038 --> 16:47.767
Yeah!

16:49.175 --> 16:53.043
I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant,
Allessandro's..

16:53.212 --> 16:55.373
and I just got a bad review.

16:55.581 --> 16:58.482
-Allessandro's? I love that place!
-You do?

16:58.651 --> 17:01.848
You're a great chef.
As a person you're a little..

17:02.054 --> 17:05.922
-Oh, I'm crazy, but you liked the food?
-Very much.

17:06.092 --> 17:10.495
Okay, then. I don't stink.
I'm a good chef! Okay.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.097
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.995
Did either of you pay for this class?

17:16.202 --> 17:20.104
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

17:27.713 --> 17:33.379
I was the point person on my company's
transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

17:33.586 --> 17:37.955
-You must have had your hands full.
-That I did. That I did.

17:38.457 --> 17:42.257
So let's talk a little bit
about your duties.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.092
My duties?

17:51.337 --> 17:52.565
All right.

17:52.772 --> 17:57.209
You'll be heading a whole division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.912
-I see.
-But there'll be 30 people under you..

18:04.083 --> 18:07.109
so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

18:11.123 --> 18:14.286
-Good to know.
-We could go into detail..

18:14.493 --> 18:16.484
No, don't, I beg of you.

18:16.662 --> 18:20.564
All right. We'll have a definite
answer for you on Monday.

18:20.733 --> 18:24.897
But I can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.

18:25.237 --> 18:28.172
-Really?
-Absolutely.

18:29.241 --> 18:32.301
-You can relax. You did great.
-Yeah, thanks.

18:32.478 --> 18:36.437
I was really nervous.
I'm told I come on too strongly.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.780
And then it was really hard
to sidestep that "duty" thing.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.912
Duties?

18:44.590 --> 18:46.956
Doodies?

18:47.994 --> 18:50.019
Poo?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.527
Poo?

18:54.700 --> 18:59.160
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

18:59.338 --> 19:03.138
That was the real Chandler Bing.
This is some crazy guy.

19:03.342 --> 19:07.335
Call security! There's a crazy guy
out in the hall!

19:08.014 --> 19:10.107
Poo?

19:10.616 --> 19:13.608
I'll look forward to your call.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.681
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.055
-You're back.
-How are you?

19:23.229 --> 19:28.565
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

19:28.734 --> 19:31.328
It was fun.
We just had coffee.

19:31.537 --> 19:36.167
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

19:36.942 --> 19:40.002
What's going on?
Do you not like Katie?

19:40.212 --> 19:46.208
No. No, she was nice. I mean,
she was a little slutty, but who isn't?

19:46.385 --> 19:47.647
Well, I liked her.

19:47.853 --> 19:52.756
Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla
if it called you lndiana Jones.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.727
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

19:57.897 --> 20:01.526
No. It's just that..
Katie bothered me.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.498
Why? What was wrong with her?

20:04.770 --> 20:08.228
There was nothing wrong with her.
She was lovely.

20:08.474 --> 20:12.467
-Okay. So, what's the matter?
-I don't want you to date her.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.011
Why? What, are you jealous?

20:16.215 --> 20:20.117
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.

20:20.286 --> 20:23.881
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.992
It's terrible to even think this
and it's inappropriate..

20:28.194 --> 20:33.257
but I want you to be at my constant
beck and call, 24 hours a day.

20:33.566 --> 20:37.627
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feel.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.097
-Okay.
-What?

20:43.309 --> 20:47.370
I won't date. I'll..

20:47.546 --> 20:50.413
I'll be here with you all the time.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.278
Really?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.318
But I'm being so unreasonable.

20:59.391 --> 21:04.795
True, but you're allowed to be
unreasonable. You're having our baby.

21:09.135 --> 21:13.265
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.543
You feel better?

21:18.811 --> 21:22.838
No, not really. You're pressing
the baby into my bladder..

21:23.048 --> 21:25.380
and now I have to pee.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.779
-Okay.
-Rach?

21:26.952 --> 21:30.251
-Yeah?
-Just one thing..

21:31.056 --> 21:37.017
We live together. You're having our
baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else.

21:37.196 --> 21:41.132
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

21:43.669 --> 21:47.662
Wow. I don't know, maybe..

21:47.873 --> 21:51.434
Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.

21:52.711 --> 21:56.943
-Like you did when I had to pee?
-Oh! I knew that.

21:57.116 --> 22:00.313
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!

22:02.688 --> 22:05.714
Okay. Because for a minute
you seemed..

22:05.958 --> 22:08.984
-No, it's just..
-Like you actually..

22:09.161 --> 22:12.096
That's just because I'm such
a good messer!

22:18.404 --> 22:19.632
-Rach?
-Yeah?

22:19.839 --> 22:22.330
-The bathroom?
-Right.

22:25.878 --> 22:29.006
I had a great time. I learned how to bake,
ate great food.

22:29.181 --> 22:34.483
It's my first A since 7th grade and
I didn't even sleep with the teacher.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.088
-Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
-Yeah.

22:38.490 --> 22:42.017
-Wanna feel good about yourself?
-What the hell!

22:42.194 --> 22:44.685
Let's start with some basics.

22:44.897 --> 22:50.597
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

22:56.609 --> 22:59.510
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
