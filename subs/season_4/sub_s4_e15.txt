WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.593
I'm getting my nails done!

00:04.871 --> 00:07.032
You said it was going to be fun.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.739
Which it kind of is.

00:11.077 --> 00:14.046
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.144
There's one right over there.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.447
That's a mailman!

00:18.985 --> 00:21.044
That's our mailman!

00:21.788 --> 00:23.847
Hi, how are you....

00:27.727 --> 00:31.720
Don't worry. This doesn't
make you any less of a guy.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.725
That does.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.468
What am I sitting on?

00:39.572 --> 00:43.269
What was this woman scratching
when this broke off?

00:43.676 --> 00:45.610
You know who had nails like that?

00:45.845 --> 00:46.834
Oh...

00:47.113 --> 00:48.239
...my...

00:48.448 --> 00:49.972
...God!

00:52.819 --> 00:54.980
The One with All the Rugby

01:40.300 --> 01:42.598
Joey, let me ask you a question.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.236
What does this light switch do?

01:45.438 --> 01:46.871
Nothing.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.372
Did it drive you crazy
to not know?

01:49.576 --> 01:51.601
I know what it did.
Nothing.

01:53.379 --> 01:57.110
They put it there for something.
How can you not care?

01:57.383 --> 01:58.714
Like this.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.445
Here's another question.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.692
What does the silver
knob on the toilet do?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.188
It flushes it.

02:08.428 --> 02:12.524
Since you know, when you come over,
would you use it?

02:15.935 --> 02:17.732
-Hello.
-Hey.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.806
-Oh, my God. Wow.
-Guess who we saw today?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.245
-Janice!
-ls this amazing?

02:27.747 --> 02:30.944
-How have you been?
-Well, I'm divorced.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.448
Oh, wow.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.986
I'm riding the alimony pony.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.921
And there it is.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.891
I just came up to say "hi."

02:45.431 --> 02:47.262
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.094
I'll see you tonight.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.668
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.169
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.064
I can't stand the woman!

02:57.177 --> 02:59.941
What?
I thought you were crazy about her!

03:00.146 --> 03:03.843
But you know all those annoying
things she did before?

03:04.083 --> 03:06.813
Her voice, her laugh
and her personality?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.212
They're all back!

03:09.923 --> 03:12.585
And she's picked up, like,
nine new ones!

03:12.825 --> 03:15.760
Why'd you bring her here?
There's people here!

03:17.931 --> 03:20.263
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.492
You are not!
You never break up with her.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.327
I don't have to break up.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.371
We're not involved.
I'll do a preemptive strike.

03:28.608 --> 03:31.509
I'll end it with her
before it starts.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.941
My ass is, like, frozen!

03:35.782 --> 03:39.115
Try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.344
I'm telling you!

03:50.697 --> 03:53.461
I can't believe
you walk alone here at night.

03:54.067 --> 03:58.003
-You hear such stories about New York.
-It's not that bad.

03:58.204 --> 04:01.139
I mean, l, for one,
feel perfectly safe.

04:02.809 --> 04:03.867
Help! Help!

04:06.512 --> 04:07.672
No, no, Ross!

04:07.880 --> 04:09.848
These are friends from home.

04:10.049 --> 04:12.540
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.586
-Hi, mate.
-How are you, man?

04:15.922 --> 04:19.323
That was a good one, huh?
"Help! Help!"

04:19.993 --> 04:20.982
How are you?

04:21.261 --> 04:24.526
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

04:24.731 --> 04:26.460
...but I've been rather busy.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.931
We have not seen each other
since that U2 concert.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.333
Oh, my God. You're right.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.905
Actually, the last time we saw
each other was the next morning.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.236
Oh, Liam!

04:39.512 --> 04:41.104
Oh, Liam.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.080
So were you guys playing soccer?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.413
Or should I call it "football"?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.184
We were playing rugby.

04:51.424 --> 04:54.723
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.
You're welcome to play.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.794
Ross play rugby?
I don't think so.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.966
What's so funny?

05:02.368 --> 05:06.361
Well, you're American, to start with.
You don't have rugby here.

05:07.907 --> 05:12.571
Well, we didn't have freedom
here until 1776 either, so....

05:12.812 --> 05:15.542
So, good!
We'll see you at the park at two.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.215
Cheers!

05:25.958 --> 05:29.894
Oh, boy! I just love to sing.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.729
Yes, I know you do.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.659
The reason people complained...

05:33.933 --> 05:38.233
...was because they paid to hear
the actor sing "Old Man River."

05:38.971 --> 05:39.960
Look at us!

05:40.173 --> 05:44.735
Who would've thought Cupid had
a station at 14th Street Nails?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.010
Okay, we have to talk.

05:49.615 --> 05:53.483
I'm just getting out of
a very serious relationship.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.813
I know. And I'm just
getting out of a marriage.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.753
Talk about "meant to be."

06:00.960 --> 06:04.259
Right. But I think this
is happening too soon.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.090
Oh, too soon, too schmoon!

06:07.834 --> 06:11.270
Face it, I'm not letting you
get away this time.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.630
I hear you!

06:16.876 --> 06:17.865
But...

06:18.111 --> 06:19.339
...unfortunately...

06:19.612 --> 06:21.170
...my company...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.713
...is transferring me overseas.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.278
Oh, no!

06:28.054 --> 06:29.544
Where to?

06:30.323 --> 06:31.881
To Paris?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.615
No, not Paris.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.522
To London? Rome? Vienna?

06:36.696 --> 06:37.720
Barcelona?

06:37.964 --> 06:40.660
Could you just stop talking
for a second?

06:43.035 --> 06:44.730
Yemen.

06:46.839 --> 06:50.400
That's right. Yes!
I'm being transferred to Yemen!

06:50.877 --> 06:51.901
When?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.737
I don't know exactly.

06:54.981 --> 06:59.213
Well, I will just have to
soak up every ounce...

06:59.419 --> 07:04.083
...of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.918
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.090
-Done?
-Yep!

07:16.102 --> 07:17.228
What's up?

07:17.503 --> 07:19.266
This switch is
driving me crazy.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.939
I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

07:22.208 --> 07:26.201
Four don't work, which means
one is controlled by the switch.

07:26.412 --> 07:30.007
So I plugged things in the outlets
that make noise.

07:30.216 --> 07:33.845
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.519
Bet I stopped listening first.

07:38.858 --> 07:42.123
You know, you also could
have used lamps...

07:42.361 --> 07:43.794
...and followed the light.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.098
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.391
So, everybody ready?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.798
Here we go!

07:55.708 --> 07:58.643
Something. I hear something.
Where is it?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.747
It's coming from Joey!

08:13.459 --> 08:16.622
Oh, my God! That's so freaky!
Turn him off!

08:25.671 --> 08:28.799
Could we put on the news?
It might be raining.

08:29.609 --> 08:33.443
Hold on. I'm watching
this rugby thing on ESPN.

08:33.646 --> 08:36.513
I'm man enough to play this sport!

08:36.782 --> 08:40.946
You're not even man enough to
get the channel that carries the sport.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.583
Hey there, Ross!

08:46.826 --> 08:48.259
Janice.

08:50.663 --> 08:54.190
You know, you really didn't
have to help me pack.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.664
When you said all you'd be doing
before you leave is packing...

08:58.871 --> 09:01.339
...you really didn't
leave me much choice.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.101
I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.604
What's going on?

09:08.047 --> 09:12.347
I'm packing, you know,
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.878
Thanks for telling me!

09:17.690 --> 09:21.490
I'm going to be pretend-moving
to Yemen. To get rid of her.

09:22.795 --> 09:23.784
Good one!

09:25.498 --> 09:28.899
Yemen! That actually sounds
like a real country!

09:29.569 --> 09:34.097
I'll show you how to roll your
underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.569
It's a space-saver.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.639
I do that because
it makes me look taller.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.975
Come on!

09:44.550 --> 09:47.018
-Joey, trade lives with me.
-Nope.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.683
Ross, I can't believe
you said you'd play.

09:51.891 --> 09:52.983
This is brutal!

09:53.225 --> 09:54.749
I can handle it.

09:54.994 --> 09:59.590
Please, Ross. You got hurt
playing badminton with my dad.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.991
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.864
Look! Right here,
it's called a "scrum."

10:09.075 --> 10:10.508
It's like a huddle.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.268
And is a hum like a scruddle?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.082
Ross, they're going kill you!

10:19.185 --> 10:20.880
Why are you doing this, anyway?

10:21.887 --> 10:24.549
You should've seen the guy
she used to date.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.882
He's like "Joe Rugby"!

10:27.126 --> 10:30.357
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?
That's funny!

10:32.398 --> 10:34.525
Oh, I see. You did that.

10:36.235 --> 10:40.467
She thought the very idea of me
playing rugby was hilarious.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.197
So I'll show her
how tough I really am.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.044
I'm sorry.
You are a tough guy.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.546
The toughest paleontologist I know.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.716
Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.389
Thanks.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.620
Don't worry about me.

11:00.926 --> 11:04.384
I'll just look energetic
and stay away from the ball.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.566
I'll be that guy,
right outside the circle.

11:13.472 --> 11:16.066
Maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.146
Stay away from that guy
and that guy...

11:29.388 --> 11:32.289
...and that one.
Dude, they're all huge!

11:33.859 --> 11:35.451
They're no bigger than me.

11:35.728 --> 11:40.688
You're closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.733
I'm going to go say "hello."

11:52.645 --> 11:54.135
I kind of liked it.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.040
I know what to do.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.582
I've got to go Red Ross.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.349
You know, Red Ross?

12:04.156 --> 12:05.851
Totally don't know.

12:06.092 --> 12:09.357
That time we were in line
for Dances With Wolves...

12:09.595 --> 12:13.258
...and that guy cut in front of us
and I just lost it?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.991
Screamed at him, turned all red!

12:16.435 --> 12:18.096
Red Ross!

12:21.273 --> 12:23.070
You'll see!

12:24.276 --> 12:26.005
Liam, do me a favor.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.408
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.341
You don't say?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.120
Good luck, babe.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.154
Come on, get in here!

12:46.999 --> 12:47.988
Come on!

12:56.509 --> 12:58.477
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!

12:58.677 --> 13:00.110
Ross, get in!

13:11.957 --> 13:13.049
Joey!

13:16.962 --> 13:20.659
You're not going to believe it!
Joshua came in today, and guess what?

13:20.866 --> 13:22.231
He asked you out?

13:22.468 --> 13:26.404
But I showed him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.873
Saucy!

13:31.310 --> 13:34.871
-What are these?
-Electrical plans for the building.

13:36.415 --> 13:37.882
Okay, should I be scared?

13:39.151 --> 13:43.019
I know that switch does something.
I got these from City Hall.

13:43.222 --> 13:45.986
I just paid $25
and waited for three hours.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.591
Wow! If only more people knew!

13:53.732 --> 13:56.633
All right, do you understand any of this?

13:56.802 --> 14:00.135
No, I don't understand any
of this electrical stuff.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.207
All right, does this look like a switch?

14:03.375 --> 14:04.865
I don't know.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.636
-ls this wiring?
-I don't know.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.706
That looks like a bunny though.

14:20.726 --> 14:24.059
You really didn't have to
take me to the airport.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.322
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.535
Besides, someone had to ride
with your luggage.

14:30.736 --> 14:34.001
And your friends don't seem to care
that you're leaving.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.434
We're not that close.

14:38.844 --> 14:41.608
Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.246
Oh, no!

14:43.449 --> 14:47.510
It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving
till you get on that plane.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.121
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just "wait here" then.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.454
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

14:57.796 --> 14:58.785
One ticket?

15:00.366 --> 15:02.857
I just need a pretend ticket.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.103
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.239
Okay, what would you give a kid
to play with?

15:08.474 --> 15:10.704
Are you traveling with a child?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.840
No.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.116
She'll think I'm
handing you a credit card.

15:18.384 --> 15:22.150
But what I'll really hand you
is a library card.

15:23.589 --> 15:28.253
A ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.328
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.455
Do you have to stay?

15:35.134 --> 15:36.863
American Express?

15:46.979 --> 15:50.972
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!

15:51.183 --> 15:55.813
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you, with the accent.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.853
That's just halftime.
There's more.

16:02.661 --> 16:03.650
Did you see me?

16:03.963 --> 16:07.364
I was pretty good.
That is one fun game!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.327
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?

16:10.669 --> 16:11.658
Thanks!

16:14.139 --> 16:15.970
I think I'm dying.
I really do.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.266
Poor baby!

16:17.409 --> 16:19.206
Tell my son that I love him.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.943
Excellent!
Got to have some more fun!

16:24.216 --> 16:25.808
They are killing you.

16:27.553 --> 16:28.577
That's not true.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.650
She's right.
You have to stop!

16:30.889 --> 16:33.915
No! I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!

16:34.126 --> 16:37.323
Dude, you go back out there,
you'll be Dead Ross.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.724
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to finish this game.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.935
If you insist on it,
at least let me help you.

16:44.169 --> 16:48.105
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!

16:49.308 --> 16:53.938
That's not it. I just know a few
things that can help you inflict pain.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.736
I like that.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.475
Listen closely.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.742
Devon has got a weak ankle.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.010
One swift kick and he'll back off.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.915
Bad ankle. Got it!

17:04.123 --> 17:08.321
And that big bloke with the beard?
He's got a trick hip.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.821
And David over there,
he doesn't wear a cup.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.423
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay!

17:15.634 --> 17:20.435
And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.367
But Liam's on my team.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.610
-I don't care. Just get him!
-Go and get him!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.346
I am going back in!

17:31.383 --> 17:33.977
Red Ross! Yeah!

17:43.862 --> 17:44.886
What are these?

17:45.164 --> 17:48.395
Just some pictures
I made and hung up.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.863
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.598
No, don't.

18:00.679 --> 18:04.012
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

18:06.685 --> 18:09.017
Oh, my God! Look at this!

18:09.254 --> 18:12.690
But there is a wire there!
It's connected to something!

18:12.925 --> 18:16.759
I don't care! The wires have
come loose in your head!

18:17.096 --> 18:20.259
If I could follow the wire,
I'd find out what it did.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.455
And did you?

18:21.667 --> 18:22.691
No.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.862
It disappears behind there.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.239
For a minute, I thought
it went downstairs.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.334
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.948
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.980
Hey, Mrs. Catrokis, do you know Kenny?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.285
You have got to be kid Wow!

18:48.794 --> 18:50.921
Are you sure you
don't want a doctor?

18:51.196 --> 18:54.131
No, that'll just bring me down!

18:54.466 --> 18:58.596
This was great! I was great!
This was a great day!

18:58.804 --> 19:01.068
I'm buying everyone coffee.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.967
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.642
No, not you.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.642
Your eye's still popping out.
I'll go get some ice.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.477
Ice, yeah!
I'm so in the mood for ice.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.580
You were amazing out there.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.647
I kind of was, wasn't l?

19:19.892 --> 19:20.881
Oh, my God!

19:21.093 --> 19:24.790
I made a man twice my size cry!

19:25.330 --> 19:30.165
I haven't done that since I was four and
I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.171
You really enjoyed yourself,
didn't you?

19:34.406 --> 19:36.897
Are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.009
I gave a guy a bloody nose!

19:39.244 --> 19:41.337
I'm not proud of it...

19:42.414 --> 19:43.813
...but I really am!

19:45.317 --> 19:47.251
And it's all because of you.

19:47.586 --> 19:52.148
-Wonderful, amazing you.
-I think you've got a concussion.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.949
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.163
You're welcome.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.197
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?

20:02.434 --> 20:03.492
It's worth the pain.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.435
You know what? It's not.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.804
This is the final boarding call
for flight 664 to Yemen.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.213
Well, I guess I gotta go.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.349
My Bing-a-ling.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.190
I'll wait for you.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.486
How long will you be gone?

20:31.396 --> 20:36.231
Well, just until we find
an energy source to replace fuel.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.036
I'll write you every day.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.467
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.169
Okay. Goodbye.

21:06.732 --> 21:10.168
Janice! There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.827
And also, you said you'd leave
after I got on the plane!

21:14.606 --> 21:18.269
No. I want to see you take off.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.445
Well, then I guess
I'm going to Yemen.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.182
I'm going to Yemen!

21:26.618 --> 21:29.951
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

21:35.761 --> 21:39.527
All right. The super couldn't
figure out what it did.

21:39.731 --> 21:43.132
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

21:43.335 --> 21:46.395
I've had seven
pretty serious shocks.

21:47.339 --> 21:48.829
I give up.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.975
Thank God.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.071
I guess Joey was right.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.775
It does nothing.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.185
See?

22:06.825 --> 22:09.589
I'm doing it!
I am totally doing it!

22:16.835 --> 22:18.200
I lost it.
