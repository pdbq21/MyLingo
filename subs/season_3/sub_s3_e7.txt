WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:06.296
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter
how famous their parents are...

00:06.464 --> 00:08.924
...nobody is allowed
to climb on the dinosaur.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.427
But of course,
this went right in one ear...

00:11.594 --> 00:14.346
I love how he cares so much
about stuff.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.475
If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.897
Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.027
When are those gonna become extinct?

00:30.989 --> 00:34.658
If I was a superhero
who could fly and be invisible...

00:34.826 --> 00:37.077
...that would be the best.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.293
What does Rachel see in this guy?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.629
I love Rachel.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.593
I wish she was my wife.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.815
Who's singing?

01:58.868 --> 02:01.995
Hey, when you guys were kids
and you played Happy Days...

02:02.205 --> 02:05.874
...who were you? I was always Richie.
- I was always Joanie.

02:06.042 --> 02:10.295
Question: Was, uh, "Egg the Gellers"
the war cry of your neighborhood?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.049
Ew, ew! It's the Mattress King.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.884
- Don't look. Change the channel.
Boo!

02:16.052 --> 02:18.679
Wait. I want to see this.
After I divorce him...

02:18.847 --> 02:21.974
...half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.227
Despair fills the mattress showroom.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.313
My kingdom is suddenly
without a queen.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.065
I'm so depressed...

02:30.233 --> 02:31.817
...I'm going to slash...

02:31.985 --> 02:34.111
...my prices! Check it out!

02:34.279 --> 02:38.365
599 for a California king.
499 for a pillow-top queen set.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.826
I'm going medieval on prices.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.870
What a wank.

02:43.037 --> 02:47.082
Oh, I cannot believe he's using
our divorce to sell mattresses.

02:47.250 --> 02:51.420
I know. At 499 for a pillow-top queen,
who cares about the divorce?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.922
Those babies will sell themselves.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.886
And I'm appalled for you, by the way.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.432
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.

03:06.936 --> 03:12.316
Okay. Okay, Daddy. We'll see you
tomorrow night. Okay, bye-bye.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.277
- "We"?
- Ahem.

03:15.820 --> 03:19.948
- Are, uh, having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.409
Oh, shoot. Tomorrow's not good.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.078
I'm supposed to, um, fall off
the Empire State Building...

03:25.246 --> 03:27.623
...and land on a bicycle
with no seat, so...

03:30.251 --> 03:32.419
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.631
Please. He refers to me as "Wet-Head. "

03:36.591 --> 03:39.259
Honey, he calls everybody
by a nickname.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.721
Okay, look, I know. Just one dinner.
Please, one night. For me. Please?

03:42.889 --> 03:45.724
I just want him to love you like I do.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.852
All right. Well, not exactly like I do.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.688
But if you do come to dinner...

03:51.856 --> 03:55.234
...I'll love you like I do
in that black thing that you like.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.361
I'll go.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.492
- Fine.
- Thank you.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.497
Hi, Gunther.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.707
Yeah. We'll see.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.336
- Hey, you guys.
Hey.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.088
Hey. Hey.
- Guess what.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.881
- I got a gig.
- Great.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.593
See, that's why I can never be an actor.
Because I can't say "gig. "

04:21.761 --> 04:25.013
Yeah, I can't say "croissant. "
Oh, my God.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.809
- What's the part?
- It's not a part. No.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.979
I'm teaching Acting for Soap Operas
at the Learning Extension.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.397
Come on. That's great.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.149
It's like my chance
to give something back...

04:36.317 --> 04:38.485
...to the acting community.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.905
You know, you're probably not allowed
to sleep with any of your students.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.537
I know.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.795
Ugh. I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.756
I mean, if you buy a bed
from Janice's ex-husband...

04:59.924 --> 05:01.675
...that's like betraying Chandler.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.052
Not at these prices.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.183
Hi.

05:10.393 --> 05:14.104
You know, in England this car would be
on the other side of the store.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.527
Whoosh.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.406
Oh, oh, oh.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.825
Phoebe, come here.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.952
Ah, this is my new bed.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.913
You gotta feel this bad boy.

05:32.081 --> 05:35.208
Ugh. Monica, it still feels so weird,
you know?

05:35.376 --> 05:36.877
Chandler's your friend. Oh.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.588
Oh, my God.

05:40.506 --> 05:45.385
Oh. All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends. Oh.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.103
Good evening.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.773
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.777
And I will be teaching
Acting for Soap Operas.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.820
Now, um...

06:04.155 --> 06:09.409
...on my first day as Dr. Drake
Ramoray on Days of our Lives...

06:12.288 --> 06:15.332
...uh, ahem, I learned that
one of the most important things...

06:15.500 --> 06:18.502
...in soap opera acting is reacting.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.380
This does not mean acting again.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.051
It means you don't have a line,
but someone else just did.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.595
And it goes something like this. Ahem.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.020
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.023
By the way, before I forget.
To work in soap operas...

06:40.191 --> 06:43.235
...some of you are gonna have to become
much more attractive.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.154
All right, moving right along...

06:50.368 --> 06:51.868
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.664
- Oh! How was teaching last night?
- Oh, it was great. You get to say stuff like:

06:55.873 --> 07:00.419
"Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you. "

07:01.671 --> 07:03.296
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.799
Oh, and guess what.
I got an audition for All My Children.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.968
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah, it's this great part.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.678
This boxer named Nick.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.597
And I'm so, so right for it, you know?
He's just like me...

07:12.765 --> 07:14.599
...except that he's a boxer...

07:14.767 --> 07:16.393
...and has an evil twin.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.271
Oh.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.275
Dum-datta-dum.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.695
Hear ye, hear ye.
Delivery from the Mattress King.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.740
You Miss Geller?

07:30.908 --> 07:33.076
- Okay.
- Sign here.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.037
- Ooh. Do I have a middle name?
- Mm-hm.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.374
All right. Monica Felula...

07:40.084 --> 07:41.293
...Geller.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.462
It's that bedroom there.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.217
Hey, Monica bought a bed
from the Mattress King?

07:49.385 --> 07:52.721
Yeah. So please, please, please
don't say anything to Chandler.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.682
- You want me to lie to Chandler?
- Is that a problem?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.392
No.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.146
Oh, hey, hey, Nick the boxer.
Let's see what you got.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.064
- Yeah.
- All right, put them up. Come on.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.650
- Hey, you're pretty good at this.
- Ha, ha.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.944
Yeah, I had to learn.
I was staying at the Y...

08:08.196 --> 08:10.739
...and some of the young men
weren't acting Christian enough.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.203
Hey, now. Hey.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.331
- Ow. And I'm bleeding. Okay, great.
- Oh, oh!

08:19.540 --> 08:22.083
Wow. And I'm a vegetarian.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.712
All right, I'm sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.964
- Put your head back. Ooh.
- Okay. All right.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.758
- I can't see.
- I have you.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.051
Oh, God.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.888
Which bedroom
do you want it in, Ms. Geller?

08:35.056 --> 08:38.308
Oh. It's the compulsively neat one
by the window, okay?

08:38.476 --> 08:40.101
Gotcha.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.693
Hi, Daddy.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.654
This is where they put us?

08:50.821 --> 08:53.782
What? There was no table
available in the kitchen?

08:54.992 --> 08:56.618
- Hello, baby.
- You remember Ross.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.787
- Mm-hm.
- Nice to see you again, Dr. Green.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.122
So.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.005
- How's the library?
- Uh, museum.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.343
- What happened to the library?
- There never was a library.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.137
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just that I, um...

09:16.305 --> 09:18.807
I've never worked at one. Ha, ha.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.603
You know what's really good here?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.146
- The lobster.
- Mm.

09:25.314 --> 09:29.568
- What do you say? Shall I just order three?
- Yeah, if you're really hungry. Ha, ha.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.116
It was a joke. I made a joke.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.245
Yeah, actually, Daddy,
Ross is allergic to lobster.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.080
What kind of person's
allergic to lobster?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.000
I guess the kind of person
that works in a library. Ha, ha.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.835
- It's not...
- I know. It's a museum.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.671
What, you're the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.840
Uh, waiter.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.968
We will have two lobsters and a menu.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.641
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?

10:01.809 --> 10:03.685
They found rust.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.814
- Do you know what rust does to a boat?
- Gives it a nice antique-y look?

10:12.820 --> 10:16.448
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.074
Wow, I'm sorry.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.577
When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
Ha, ha.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.376
Excuse me for a moment,
will you, please?

10:28.544 --> 10:30.879
I wanna say good night
to the Levines before we go.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.714
Okay.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.886
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.013
Yeah. Oh.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.724
Uh-oh. I think your dad
must have added wrong.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.559
He only tipped, like, 4 percent.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.561
Yeah. Ahem, that's Daddy.

10:47.021 --> 10:51.316
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it
bother you? You're a waitress.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.109
Yes, it bothers me, Ross.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.570
But, you know, if he was a regular
at the coffee house...

10:55.738 --> 10:57.405
...I'd be serving him sneezers.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.158
- So?
- So, Ross...

11:00.326 --> 11:04.329
...I've bugged him about this
a million times. He's not gonna change.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.873
Do you really serve people sneezers?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.668
Ahem, well, um, I don't.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.671
- All right, kids. Ready?
- Yes.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.632
- Thanks again, Dr. Green.
- Uh-huh.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.181
Wait, wait, wait,
I think I forgot my receipt.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.225
- Oh, you don't need that.
- Ahem, why not?

11:25.393 --> 11:29.562
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,
gets on your fingers and causes...

11:29.730 --> 11:31.272
...the, uh, night blindness.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.277
What is this?

11:36.612 --> 11:38.321
Who put a 20 down here?

11:38.489 --> 11:40.740
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah, that would be me.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.951
Um, I have... I have a problem.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.286
I tip way too much, way, way too much.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.539
- It's a sickness, really.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.792
- We have to do something about that.
- Excuse me.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.044
You think I'm cheap?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.505
- He didn't mean anything by that.
- Huh?

11:55.673 --> 11:59.426
- He really didn't.
- Nothing I do means anything. Really.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.930
This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.

12:04.098 --> 12:07.434
You put down 20 and you come out
looking like Mr. Big-Shot.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.352
- You really wanna be Mr. Big-Shot?
- Oh.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.399
Here. I'll tell you what. You pay the
whole bill, Mr. Big-Shot. All right?

12:16.902 --> 12:20.613
Well, "Mr. Big-Shot"
is better than "Wet-Head. "

12:21.907 --> 12:24.325
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.828
Now, I've never been able to cry
as an actor...

12:26.996 --> 12:29.581
...so if I'm in a scene
where I have to cry...

12:29.749 --> 12:31.666
...I cut a hole in my pocket...

12:31.834 --> 12:34.043
...take a pair of tweezers...

12:34.420 --> 12:36.337
...and just start pulling.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.010
Okay. Or uh...
Or let's say I want to convey...

12:42.178 --> 12:45.096
...that I've, uh,
just done something evil.

12:45.264 --> 12:49.267
Well, that would be your basic I've-got-a
fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.

12:53.522 --> 12:57.025
No? Okay.
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

12:57.193 --> 13:02.363
Well, all I do there
is try and divide 232 by 13.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.791
And that's how it's done.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.335
Great soap opera acting
tonight, everybody.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.253
Class dismissed.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.965
- Hey, Mr. Trib.
- Hey.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.176
Guess what. I got an audition.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.805
Oh. One of my students got an audition.
I'm so proud.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.892
I was wondering if you would consider
coaching me for it.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.895
- Oh, you bet. What's the part?
- Oh, it's great.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.898
It's a role on All My Children.
Nick the boxer.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.909
Had to do it, didn't you?
You couldn't leave it alone.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.580
Four percent, okay? I tip more than that
when there's a bug in my food.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.625
Ross, tonight was about the two of you
getting along.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.918
Ugh.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.628
Would you see
my chiropractor already?

13:58.796 --> 14:02.882
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went
to medical school in a mini-mall.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.222
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

14:09.390 --> 14:12.225
I'm... I'm freaking out.

14:14.270 --> 14:18.147
Monica kind of trusted me with something
and she shouldn't have.

14:18.315 --> 14:21.276
All right, I haven't lived here in a while,
so I have to ask you.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.820
Does Monica still turn the lights on
in her bedroom?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.907
- Ahem. Yeah.
- I am so dead.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.453
All right, look,
here's the bottom line, Ross.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.164
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

14:35.332 --> 14:38.126
So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow
and you can make nice.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.546
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.882
Okay. Look,
I realize my father is difficult...

14:44.049 --> 14:47.677
...but that's why you have got to be
the bigger man here.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.556
Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.

14:51.765 --> 14:55.435
I could be a big, huge, giant man
and it still wouldn't make a difference.

14:55.644 --> 15:00.023
Except that I could pick your father up
and say, "Like me. Like me, tiny doctor. "

15:01.817 --> 15:05.320
Okay, well, can't you just try it
one more time, Ross? For me? For me?

15:05.487 --> 15:08.114
Rachel, one brunch
is not gonna solve anything.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.575
You've gotta face it.
We're never gonna get along.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.994
Okay, well, you are just going to have to.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.748
Okay? I've already got a mother and father
who cannot stay in the same room.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.917
I don't want to have
a separate room for you too.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.169
Okay, okay. Okay.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.671
I'll get the bagels.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.261
What's this?

15:30.971 --> 15:34.015
Isn't it cool? Vroom. Vroom.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.726
This is not the bed I ordered.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.688
I know. You must have won,
like, a contest or something.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.733
Phoebe.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.277
Why is this car in my bedroom?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.529
I'm sorry, okay. I wasn't looking...

15:48.697 --> 15:51.741
...and the store said that they won't
take it back because you signed for it.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.702
- When did I sign for it?
- When I was you.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.539
You know what? It's all Joey's fault
because he left his nose open.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.751
Did you make brownies today?

16:03.462 --> 16:04.504
Knock, knock.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.674
Quick. Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.719
Hey, I'm going for sushi.
Does anybody want, uh...?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.599
Whoa. Somebody missed the off-ramp.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.521
It's Monica's bed. What?

16:21.689 --> 16:23.398
Okay...

16:24.149 --> 16:26.234
It's a race car.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.113
So? This has always been Monica's bed.
What, you're just noticing now?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.906
How self-involved are you?

16:34.201 --> 16:35.660
Okay, well, if this bed isn't new...

16:35.828 --> 16:38.371
...then how come there's plastic
on the mattress?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.458
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.006
Look...

16:48.215 --> 16:52.719
...I just saw my best friend's brain
smeared across the canvas.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.512
It's not gonna be me.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.472
Not me.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.225
Wow.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.812
That was good. That was...

17:03.731 --> 17:05.481
- Tweezers?
- No.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.774
Oh, wow.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.945
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

17:11.572 --> 17:12.697
Any suggestions?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.158
Hmm, I...

17:19.705 --> 17:22.331
You told him to play the boxer gay?

17:26.462 --> 17:30.298
Well, I might have said "super-gay. "

17:31.383 --> 17:33.259
You totally screwed him over.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.471
Joey, you're this guy's teacher.
I mean, how could you do this?

17:36.638 --> 17:38.723
Because, Monica, the guy's so good.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.184
And I really, really want this part.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.353
Well, if you really, really want it,
then it's okay.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.566
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.072
- Ross?
- Dr. Green, how are you?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.409
Thanks for dinner last night.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.204
Thank you for teaching me
a valuable lesson.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.956
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

18:07.836 --> 18:10.088
Okay, that's it. I can't take it anymore.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.798
What, what? He's interested in you.

18:11.965 --> 18:15.384
- He just wants to know how you got here.
- Oh, please.

18:16.053 --> 18:19.180
- Sweetie, it's hopeless. I'm just gonna go.
- What? Ross.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.349
- I'm sorry. It's just...
Ross?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.101
What's with the neck?

18:23.310 --> 18:26.145
He's got this thing and I keep
telling him to go to my chiropractor.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.231
You still going to that chiropractor?

18:28.398 --> 18:30.775
That man couldn't get into med school
in Ixtapa.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.237
Yeah, thank you.
That's what I keep saying.

18:34.404 --> 18:38.199
Excuse me, ahem, Dr. Bobby happens
to be an excellent doctor.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.577
Wait a minute. His name is Dr. Bobby?

18:42.746 --> 18:45.081
- Well, that's his last name.
- And his first name.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.542
He's Bobby Bobby?

18:48.710 --> 18:50.795
Ahem. It's Robert Bobby.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.213
Oh.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.966
And, um, excuse me. He helps me.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.344
- Oh. Please. Ask her how?
- What do you need help for?

18:58.554 --> 19:00.805
With my alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.224
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Argue with that.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.601
What? It's true.
My right leg is two inches shorter.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.979
Come on, you're just tilting.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.190
- Her legs are fine.
- I know that.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.235
- So why do you let her go to a chiropractor?
- I'm sorry, "Let her"?

19:14.403 --> 19:17.947
What can I do? She doesn't listen to me
about renter's insurance, either.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.992
Wait a minute.
You don't have renter's insurance?

19:22.911 --> 19:25.079
- No. Ahem.
- So, what if somebody steals something?

19:26.456 --> 19:29.917
How you gonna run after him
with one leg shorter than the other?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.383
Hey, would you, uh...?
Would you like some juice?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.969
- I'd love some juice.
- Okay.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.140
Well, this is going so well.
Did you see us? Did you see?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.893
Yeah, honey. I was standing right there.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.770
Why don't you tell him about the mole
I haven't gotten checked?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.272
Excellent.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.237
There will come a time
in each of your careers...

19:58.405 --> 20:02.491
...when you'll have a chance to screw over
another soap opera actor.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.954
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.459
And I'm ashamed to say...

20:11.627 --> 20:13.252
...that I took it.

20:14.338 --> 20:18.633
I advised a fellow actor to play a role...

20:19.551 --> 20:21.552
...homosexually.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.973
Yeah.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.560
We both auditioned for the part and, uh...

20:31.063 --> 20:32.980
...as it turned out...

20:33.774 --> 20:35.399
...they...

20:36.568 --> 20:40.029
They liked the stupid gay thing
and cast him.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.991
And now...

20:44.159 --> 20:47.078
...he's got a two-year contract...

20:48.455 --> 20:50.581
...opposite Susan Lucci...

20:50.749 --> 20:53.918
...the first lady of daytime television.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.170
And me?

20:56.672 --> 21:00.466
Me, I'm stuck here teaching
a bunch of people...

21:00.634 --> 21:03.970
...most of whom are too ugly
to even be on TV.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.933
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.319
Thank you.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.200
- Uh, may I help you?
- Yes, hi.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.786
I'm the lady who got stuck
with the race-car bed.

21:28.954 --> 21:33.374
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

21:33.542 --> 21:37.837
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller. "

21:38.547 --> 21:40.715
All right, jester man, look,
we wanna see the king.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.842
Nobody sees the king.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.928
Okay. I'm talking to the king.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.097
Hey, you can't go back there.

21:53.854 --> 21:57.732
Oh, my God.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.706
Hey, watch it, lady.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.922
Hey, good-looking.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.559
All right, I'll leave.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.978
My bed's so boring.
