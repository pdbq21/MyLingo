WEBVTT

00:01.348 --> 00:03.466
Oh, hey, Joey.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.627
- Hey.
- Listen, I need to ask you something.

00:06.794 --> 00:08.627
You know how my stepdad's in prison?

00:08.796 --> 00:10.754
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:10.918 --> 00:14.801
He was supposed to get a weekend
furlough so he could go to the wedding.

00:14.962 --> 00:17.080
But he just called and...

00:17.244 --> 00:22.039
Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the
exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.368
- So he can't come?
- No.

00:24.532 --> 00:27.686
And so there's no one to
walk me down the aisle. And...

00:28.375 --> 00:31.176
Well, I would just really love it
if you would do it.

00:32.219 --> 00:33.779
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:33.941 --> 00:36.538
You've, you know,
sort of been like a dad to me.

00:38.065 --> 00:41.539
You've always, you know, looked out
for me and shared your wisdom.

00:44.031 --> 00:46.342
I am pretty "wisdomous."

00:47.555 --> 00:49.752
So, what do you say?

00:49.917 --> 00:53.435
Are you kidding?
Phoebe, I would be honored.

00:54.161 --> 00:56.313
Oh, thank you.

00:57.685 --> 00:59.085
I hope...

01:00.047 --> 01:02.723
I hope you know how much
you mean to me.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.248
Listen, I hope...

01:05.412 --> 01:07.690
I hope that you know...

01:09.697 --> 01:13.295
I don't want you to see your father cry.
Go to your room!

02:02.469 --> 02:05.590
Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.958
It's my wedding planner.
She's driving me crazy!

02:13.120 --> 02:17.641
Hello? Okay, stop screaming!

02:17.805 --> 02:20.321
Okay, so halibut.

02:20.487 --> 02:23.050
All right, so salmon.
Either way. I don't...

02:23.210 --> 02:25.852
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Well, it matters to me!

02:27.895 --> 02:30.696
Well, I don't care. So you pick.

02:30.858 --> 02:32.896
Did you just hang up on me?

02:33.861 --> 02:37.334
All right, look, I need you at the
rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.577
Okay. What time is that?

02:40.988 --> 02:42.582
You don't know military time?

02:42.750 --> 02:45.825
I must have been in missile training
the day they taught that.

02:46.874 --> 02:48.467
Just subtract 12.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.106
Okay, so 1800 minus 12...

02:51.278 --> 02:53.636
...is 1788.

02:53.801 --> 02:55.121
- Six o'clock!
- Okay.

02:55.282 --> 02:57.594
Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.

02:58.085 --> 03:02.367
No, I said it has to be there
by 4:00. Goodbye.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.762
How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?

03:04.932 --> 03:06.491
That sounds really fancy.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.931
I told you, I just want a simple wedding.

03:09.096 --> 03:11.693
Please, honey, leave the details to me.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.455
Now, I wanna make this day
as special for you as I can.

03:14.622 --> 03:16.740
I was thinking the harpist
should wear white.

03:16.904 --> 03:20.058
Harpist? My friend Marjorie
is playing the steel drums.

03:20.227 --> 03:22.949
- Oh, she backed out.
- She did? Why?

03:23.110 --> 03:24.864
I made her.

03:25.032 --> 03:27.184
Steel drums don't really say
"elegant wedding."

03:27.354 --> 03:30.634
- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
- Hey!

03:30.798 --> 03:33.759
She will shower when Tibet is free.

03:41.609 --> 03:45.572
- Hey. You look great.
- You too.

03:45.733 --> 03:50.607
I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner.
I rarely practice my meals before I eat.

03:51.418 --> 03:53.651
What did we say
was your one gift to us?

03:53.821 --> 03:57.180
No stupid jokes, but I thought
that was for the actual wedding.

03:57.344 --> 03:59.098
Rehearse it.

03:59.547 --> 04:01.106
Hi.

04:01.268 --> 04:03.386
- Thanks for coming, you guys.
- Oh, yeah...

04:03.591 --> 04:06.950
I was...
I was going for a handshake.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.868
That why your hand's
against my crotch?

04:09.036 --> 04:10.994
- That is why.
- Yeah.

04:12.239 --> 04:14.197
So, Rach, where's Emma?

04:14.361 --> 04:16.001
Monica made me send her
to my mom's.

04:16.163 --> 04:18.964
Apparently, babies and weddings
don't mix.

04:19.126 --> 04:22.166
Are you still crying about
your damn baby?

04:23.010 --> 04:26.643
Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving.
Remember, 20 seconds per person.

04:26.814 --> 04:28.487
You see these clowns all the time.

04:31.859 --> 04:34.979
- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
- Yes, we are.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.818
Gosh, our little ones
are growing up fast, aren't they?

04:39.106 --> 04:40.746
- How's that?
- You know...

04:40.908 --> 04:44.267
...on one hand, you're happy for them.
On the other, it's hard to let go.

04:45.112 --> 04:47.675
Who in God's name are you?

04:48.075 --> 04:52.277
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.
I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.

04:54.522 --> 04:58.917
You know what? We have no idea what
we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.

04:59.086 --> 05:01.887
I thought we'd be groomsmen.
They would have asked us by now.

05:02.049 --> 05:04.440
When did they ask you
to be a bridesmaid?

05:04.612 --> 05:08.575
- November.
- I wanna say it's not looking good.

05:08.896 --> 05:10.650
Hey, Pheebs?

05:10.818 --> 05:14.336
You haven't told these guys
what they're doing in the wedding yet.

05:15.342 --> 05:16.902
Well, they're not in the wedding.

05:17.104 --> 05:18.664
What?

05:22.469 --> 05:24.063
Well...

05:24.431 --> 05:26.664
...this is really awkward.

05:27.154 --> 05:29.431
Oh, and I can leave.

05:30.397 --> 05:34.680
I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got
his brother and his friends from school.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.755
So, you know, you were...

05:36.924 --> 05:41.160
If it helps, you were next in line.
You just missed the cut.

05:41.368 --> 05:42.644
Oh, man.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.930
This is like figure skating team
all over again.

05:48.335 --> 05:50.647
I mean, synchronized swimming.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.699
I mean...
I mean, the balance beam.

05:53.861 --> 05:55.136
- Help me.
- Football.

05:55.302 --> 05:56.862
Thank you.

05:57.344 --> 06:00.704
Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.
That has pork in it.

06:01.388 --> 06:04.064
I thought the pot stickers
were supposed to be vegetarian?

06:04.231 --> 06:07.067
Yeah, I changed them.
I sent you a fax about it.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.466
I don't have a fax machine.

06:10.678 --> 06:13.148
Well, then there are gonna be
a few surprises.

06:15.322 --> 06:18.362
I can't believe we're gonna be
the only people not in the wedding.

06:18.526 --> 06:21.965
- I know. I hate being left out of things.
- And it's a wedding.

06:22.129 --> 06:24.726
It'll be weird if I'm not in it.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.655
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Fine.

06:28.816 --> 06:33.496
We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.

06:34.141 --> 06:36.452
Look, about tomorrow,
I've got a question for you.

06:36.624 --> 06:39.699
I found out one of my groomsmen
had an emergency and can't make it.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.463
- What happened?
- Who cares? And...?

06:43.551 --> 06:45.589
And I was wondering
if one of you guys...

06:45.753 --> 06:47.905
- I'll do it!
- Me!

06:48.676 --> 06:51.112
You both wanna do it?
There's only room for one.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.841
Pick me. I look great in a tux,
and I won't steal focus.

06:54.001 --> 06:58.317
No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.
I mean... Watch.

07:02.930 --> 07:06.563
You know, I really don't feel
very comfortable making this decision.

07:06.734 --> 07:09.774
You know, Phoebe knows you better.
I'm gonna let her choose.

07:10.497 --> 07:15.736
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say
hello to Mike's next groomsman.

07:16.343 --> 07:19.065
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...

07:19.226 --> 07:21.219
...as he is me.

07:22.389 --> 07:25.749
- Please. You're going down.
- You are going "downer."

07:25.913 --> 07:27.792
They say that on the
figure skating team?

07:27.955 --> 07:30.552
I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.201
You know I'm filling in
for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?

07:36.363 --> 07:39.757
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
- Oh, hey, my pleasure.

07:40.247 --> 07:42.444
So, what are your intentions
with my Phoebe?

07:43.250 --> 07:46.849
- I intend to marry her.
- Oh, a wiseacre.

07:48.736 --> 07:52.699
I understand you plan to support
your wife by playing the piano?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.292
Isn't that kind of unstable?

07:55.543 --> 07:58.264
- No more so than acting.
- Strike two.

07:59.306 --> 08:02.507
You're right.
She probably will support me.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.822
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.

08:06.073 --> 08:07.986
Strike three.

08:08.596 --> 08:10.394
You only get one more, Mike.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.042
So? What did you decide?

08:16.323 --> 08:18.635
I decided to pee.

08:19.406 --> 08:22.162
You have to choose one of us
to be in your wedding.

08:22.329 --> 08:24.641
- One of the groomsmen fell out.
- Oh, no, no.

08:24.812 --> 08:28.251
I can't choose between you two.
I love you both so much.

08:28.415 --> 08:31.934
Just not enough to put us
in the original wedding party.

08:32.419 --> 08:34.731
But I don't wanna choose.
It's...

08:34.942 --> 08:36.741
- Okay, wait. Rach?
- Yeah?

08:36.904 --> 08:40.183
Listen, I have a very special
bridesmaid task for you to do.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.187
Goody! What is it?

08:42.349 --> 08:44.661
Well, there's a spot open
for only one groomsman...

08:44.832 --> 08:48.350
...and you have to choose between Ross
and Chandler. So good luck with that.

08:48.516 --> 08:51.112
What? What, what, what?
No, I don't wanna do that.

08:51.278 --> 08:53.111
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.954
I'll do it!

08:55.162 --> 08:57.155
Okay, it's 2100 hours.

08:57.324 --> 09:00.080
- Time for your toast.
- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?

09:00.247 --> 09:04.369
You had a bathroom break at 2030.
Pee on your own time, Mike.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.214
In regards to the toasts, okay,
you wanna keep them short.

09:09.376 --> 09:12.257
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner
like long speeches. Okay.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.652
You just get in, do your thing,
and get out.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.542
Is that what you say to Chandler?

09:18.185 --> 09:20.827
It's 2101, and I am not amused.

09:22.149 --> 09:23.664
Okay.

09:23.831 --> 09:27.669
The bride and groom
have a few words they'd like to say.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.509
Okay. Hello, everyone.

09:31.679 --> 09:35.642
And thank you all for being here tonight.
So tomorrow's the big event.

09:35.883 --> 09:39.800
Some of you might not know, but Mike
and I didn't get off to the best start.

09:40.007 --> 09:43.207
Yeah. My friend Joey and I...

09:43.370 --> 09:47.573
...decided to fix each other up
with friends. So l...

09:49.857 --> 09:52.214
Oh, okay. I...

09:52.379 --> 09:55.454
I thought about it, and I fixed him up
with my friend Mary Ellen...

09:55.623 --> 09:59.221
...who couldn't be here tonight,
because... It's not...

09:59.386 --> 10:01.903
It's not important.
Well, she's in rehab.

10:02.510 --> 10:07.065
Anyway. So Joey said that he was
fixing me up with his friend Mike...

10:07.234 --> 10:10.708
...only he didn't have a friend Mike,
so he just brought my Mike.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.075
And... And...

10:13.240 --> 10:16.394
But despite, you know...
It got good.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.645
I wanna take a moment to mention
my mother, who couldn't be here.

10:21.809 --> 10:23.448
Oh, God.

10:23.651 --> 10:25.769
And... And moment's over.

10:25.933 --> 10:28.814
So okay... Oh, no, forget that.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.969
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.

10:31.138 --> 10:34.532
Oh, but you need to know that
to get that.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.264
So...
Oh, well, okay.

10:37.464 --> 10:39.537
I... Okay.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.584
Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!

10:43.511 --> 10:47.223
This is my wedding, okay?
I don't want this...

10:47.394 --> 10:49.786
Or this... Or this...

10:49.957 --> 10:52.109
Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...

10:52.279 --> 10:55.433
...where my fiance can go
to the bathroom any time he wants!

10:59.006 --> 11:01.158
- You know what? You're done.
- What?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.082
You're fired!

11:04.331 --> 11:05.846
Cheers.

11:14.902 --> 11:17.418
- Hey.
- Happy wedding day.

11:17.585 --> 11:19.178
Happy my wedding day to you.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.548
Joey, listen, this is gonna be
bridesmaid central, all right?

11:22.710 --> 11:24.987
We're gonna have hair and makeup
in the bathroom.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.546
I had to move a couple things in the
fridge to make room for the corsages.

11:28.716 --> 11:32.155
Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast
if I knew there was gonna be corsages.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.723
Hi.

11:38.566 --> 11:40.763
About last night...

11:40.968 --> 11:43.484
I know you're under
a lot of stress, and...

11:43.651 --> 11:47.648
Well, even though the things you said
hurt me a little bit...

11:49.376 --> 11:50.811
My point is...

11:50.978 --> 11:53.414
Well, I'm willing to take my job back.

11:54.582 --> 11:56.734
Oh, well, that's okay.

11:57.665 --> 12:01.787
I think you and I will do much better
if you're just here as a bridesmaid.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.509
Is that so?

12:05.673 --> 12:06.948
Okay.

12:07.114 --> 12:09.471
If that's really what you want,
then here.

12:09.637 --> 12:12.677
I give you the headset. I don't really
wanna give you the headset.

12:13.841 --> 12:18.157
I guess if you're taking over, then you
should probably return these messages.

12:18.325 --> 12:20.443
This is a lot.

12:20.608 --> 12:23.363
But I'm sure you can handle this.
I have won awards...

12:23.531 --> 12:26.571
...for my organizational skills.
But I'm sure you'll do fine.

12:26.734 --> 12:30.013
- You've won awards?
- I printed them out on my computer.

12:31.979 --> 12:33.299
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.339
- Where's Rach?
- She's in her room. Why?

12:35.543 --> 12:37.979
I have to talk to her
about this groomsman situation.

12:38.145 --> 12:41.664
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
while I'm in the seats like some chump.

12:46.514 --> 12:49.554
My God, you're breathtaking.

12:52.079 --> 12:53.833
What do you want?

12:54.241 --> 12:57.760
You haven't by any chance
chosen a groomsman yet, have you?

12:57.965 --> 13:00.481
Ross, please don't make this
harder than it already is.

13:00.648 --> 13:03.448
I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.605
- Chandler said it's important to him too.
- Listen. Listen.

13:07.935 --> 13:11.374
Whoever you pick is gonna
walk down the aisle with you.

13:11.539 --> 13:14.978
Now, I promise I won't say a word.
But if you pick Chandler...

13:15.142 --> 13:18.536
...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes
in your ear the whole time.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.504
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.388
Yes!

13:28.155 --> 13:31.913
Sven, I don't understand what you're
saying. What is wrong with the flowers?

13:32.079 --> 13:34.311
"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.802
I know.

13:37.444 --> 13:39.118
- Hey.
- Mike, if you were Swedish...

13:39.286 --> 13:42.646
...and you were saying the word
"lorkins," what flower would that be?

13:43.170 --> 13:44.651
- Orchids?
- Right there!

13:44.812 --> 13:47.773
That's why I'm marrying you.

13:54.261 --> 13:56.140
Hello, Michael.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.183
Joseph.

13:59.747 --> 14:01.740
May I have a word with you, please?

14:11.679 --> 14:13.432
This is...

14:13.601 --> 14:15.320
...great.

14:16.003 --> 14:17.597
Have a seat.

14:20.487 --> 14:22.161
Last night...

14:22.810 --> 14:26.283
...I tried to welcome you into my family.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.894
And instead, you disrespect me.

14:32.059 --> 14:33.653
I cannot allow this.

14:34.461 --> 14:37.821
Are you rehearsing
for some really bad Mafia movie?

14:38.385 --> 14:40.025
More back talk.

14:40.868 --> 14:46.027
And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines
from my recent unsuccessful audition...

14:46.193 --> 14:49.712
...for Family Honor 2:
This A-Time It's A-Personal.

14:51.919 --> 14:54.516
Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today.
What do you want?

14:54.682 --> 14:56.754
I want you to take this seriously!

14:56.924 --> 14:59.964
Phoebe is very,
very important to me, okay?

15:00.127 --> 15:02.484
I wanna make sure
you are gonna take care of her.

15:04.131 --> 15:06.249
Joe, I love Phoebe.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.532
She's the most important thing
in my life.

15:08.696 --> 15:11.611
I'd die before I let
anything happen to her.

15:13.140 --> 15:16.135
That's what I wanted to hear.

15:16.463 --> 15:19.026
Because she's family, okay?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.940
And now you're gonna be family.

15:21.108 --> 15:26.062
And there's nothing more important
in the whole world than family.

15:26.313 --> 15:28.431
That must have been one lousy movie.

15:28.596 --> 15:30.509
That was me!

15:33.440 --> 15:35.832
- Hi.
- Let's talk about this groomsman thing.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.804
If you pick Ross, he'll walk you
down the aisle just fine.

15:38.966 --> 15:40.799
But if you choose me...

15:40.968 --> 15:43.245
...you'll be getting some comedy.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.809
Even so...

15:50.658 --> 15:52.776
...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.

15:52.940 --> 15:55.297
Let me tell you
why you need to pick me.

15:57.024 --> 16:01.705
See, when I was a kid, you know,
I was always left out of everything...

16:01.869 --> 16:04.784
...and it really made me feel insecure.

16:04.952 --> 16:08.790
I was always picked last in gym...

16:08.956 --> 16:12.714
...even behind that fat exchange student
who didn't know the rules to baseball.

16:12.880 --> 16:16.478
I mean, this guy would strike out
and then run to third.

16:18.726 --> 16:21.607
Anyway, if I'm the only one
left out of this wedding...

16:21.769 --> 16:25.766
...I just know that all those feelings
are gonna come rushing back.

16:27.935 --> 16:29.928
All right, fine, I pick you.

16:30.097 --> 16:31.817
Yes!

16:32.459 --> 16:35.739
Make "groom" for Chandler.

16:38.906 --> 16:40.386
Oh, my.

16:42.109 --> 16:46.265
No, we're gonna do it my way.
Because your way is stupid.

16:46.433 --> 16:49.952
All right, I got to go.
I have another call, Reverend.

16:51.198 --> 16:52.838
Hello?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.958
- I'm glad we had this little talk.
- Yes.

16:55.122 --> 16:57.878
And thanks for all the
wedding night advice.

16:58.045 --> 17:00.402
That didn't make me
uncomfortable at all.

17:00.568 --> 17:02.765
All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.205
- Okay.
- Bye.

17:08.455 --> 17:11.974
Did you guys know that there's
a giant ice sculpture in the hall?

17:12.179 --> 17:14.137
Oh, my God, what's it doing here?

17:14.301 --> 17:18.264
I guess it got sent to the billing address
as opposed to the shipping address.

17:18.425 --> 17:22.503
- What a pickle.
- Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.

17:22.670 --> 17:25.140
Why is this happening to me?

17:25.633 --> 17:28.787
How bad do you wanna
stick your tongue on that?

17:34.722 --> 17:36.954
- How's it going?
- Good.

17:37.204 --> 17:41.885
I'm just getting some coffee
so I'm alert for the wedding.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.806
That's what I was doing too.

17:44.972 --> 17:48.047
Well, you have fun tonight.

17:48.215 --> 17:50.891
- You too.
- Oh, I will.

17:51.098 --> 17:52.579
Me too.

17:56.343 --> 18:00.135
Wait a minute. I know why I'm being
such an ass. Why are you?

18:00.868 --> 18:04.261
- I'm not supposed to tell you.
- I'm not supposed to tell you.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.433
You told us both
we could be in the wedding?

18:08.836 --> 18:12.070
In my defense, you weren't
supposed to tell each other!

18:12.960 --> 18:15.636
Rachel, only one of us can do it.
You have to choose.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.319
You and me together again.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.245
Rach, Rach? knock-knock.

18:21.408 --> 18:23.480
- Who's there?
- I'll tell you at the wedding.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.489
Hey, I forgot my scarf.

18:26.654 --> 18:29.409
I can't do this. I don't know
which one of you guys to pick.

18:29.577 --> 18:32.572
Oh, you haven't picked yet?
Oh, good, because I had an idea.

18:32.740 --> 18:37.535
I thought it would be fun if the third
groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.

18:37.745 --> 18:40.899
What? A dog?
No. Rachel gets to choose.

18:41.549 --> 18:44.224
Wow, this is a tough one.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.349
I think I'm gonna have to go
with the dog.

18:47.835 --> 18:51.274
So, what you're saying is
that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...

18:51.438 --> 18:55.401
...but the food is not? And the drinks
are there but the bartender is not?

18:55.563 --> 18:58.763
Are you freaking kidding me?

18:59.567 --> 19:01.206
How's it going?

19:01.368 --> 19:03.167
- Help me.
- What?

19:03.330 --> 19:06.006
I want you to be crazy bitch again.

19:07.775 --> 19:09.414
Really?

19:10.017 --> 19:11.292
Please?

19:12.099 --> 19:16.255
- You really want me to come back?
- More than I wanna get married.

19:18.105 --> 19:21.305
Okay, people, we are back in business!

19:21.468 --> 19:25.021
Oh, God, I have missed you
so much. Okay.

19:25.192 --> 19:27.914
Get your hair and makeup done.
I'll take care of everything.

19:28.075 --> 19:30.638
- Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
- About what?

19:30.798 --> 19:32.791
The blizzard.
I just saw on the news...

19:32.960 --> 19:34.759
...it's the worst snowstorm
in 20 years.

19:34.922 --> 19:37.758
They already closed
all the bridges and tunnels.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.719
But the band and the photographer
are coming in from New Jersey.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.847
I don't think they are.

19:44.491 --> 19:47.567
Looks like you're not gonna be
in the wedding, either.

19:48.656 --> 19:50.728
So sorry, Pheebs.

20:01.468 --> 20:05.512
- Well, the club lost its power.
- The news said most of the city did.

20:05.713 --> 20:08.549
- Since when do you watch the news?
- For your information...

20:08.716 --> 20:11.631
...since they hired
a very hot weather girl.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.792
I can't believe you aren't
getting married today.

20:14.962 --> 20:16.841
I know.

20:17.004 --> 20:20.887
It's so beautiful out there. You always
wanted to get married outside.

20:21.048 --> 20:23.565
- Why don't you just do it on the street?
- What?

20:23.731 --> 20:26.327
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.694
I mean, you couldn't ask
for a more romantic setting.

20:29.857 --> 20:32.453
This could be the simple wedding
you've always wanted.

20:33.501 --> 20:35.220
What do you think?

20:36.624 --> 20:38.935
I think I wanna get married to you today.

20:40.788 --> 20:44.580
Me too. Monica, do you think
we could do it?

20:46.193 --> 20:47.753
Affirmative!

20:55.122 --> 20:57.354
Okay, let's get these chairs out here!

20:57.525 --> 21:00.041
Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.

21:06.694 --> 21:11.819
Okay, who left the ice sculpture
on the steam grate?

21:13.060 --> 21:16.693
- Michael.
- Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!

21:16.864 --> 21:19.779
- There you go.
- Hi. Hi.

21:20.628 --> 21:23.668
I know getting married in the street
isn't what you approve of.

21:23.831 --> 21:28.990
No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow.
I could look at them forever.

21:29.196 --> 21:31.234
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.

21:32.159 --> 21:34.311
Come on, sweetheart.

21:35.683 --> 21:38.153
You know, Chappy's too small
to handle all this snow.

21:38.325 --> 21:40.283
Someone has to
walk him down the aisle.

21:40.447 --> 21:42.884
- Would this person be in the wedding?
- I guess.

21:43.050 --> 21:44.531
- I'll do it!
- I'll do it!

21:44.692 --> 21:48.005
Chandler, hello?
I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?

21:48.175 --> 21:50.931
I'm not scared.
I'll just take little Chappy and...

21:51.098 --> 21:53.820
He can sense my fear!
My throat is exposed!

21:55.222 --> 21:58.582
I guess I'm in the wedding then.

21:59.186 --> 22:01.383
He stinks.

22:01.989 --> 22:04.984
Level one alert! I repeat,
level one, this is not a drill!

22:05.152 --> 22:08.592
We have a situation. The minister called.
He's snowed in, he can't make it.

22:08.756 --> 22:10.589
- Oh, no.
- Hey, don't worry.

22:10.758 --> 22:12.876
- I'm still ordained from your wedding.
- Really?

22:13.040 --> 22:17.196
Yeah. You think I'd give up being
a minister and pay to ride the subway?

22:17.765 --> 22:20.156
Ministers don't ride the subway for free.

22:20.327 --> 22:23.528
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully,
but, yeah, we do.

22:24.932 --> 22:27.654
We have to find someone else
to walk Phoebe down the aisle.

22:27.815 --> 22:29.329
I'll do it!

22:33.300 --> 22:35.258
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.541
Chandler, come with me.

22:43.030 --> 22:47.506
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony,
and Chandler's giving you away.

22:47.675 --> 22:50.191
Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.

22:51.879 --> 22:54.794
So you ready to do this?

22:55.082 --> 22:57.963
Oh, my God. This is really happening.

22:58.485 --> 23:02.243
- Phoebe, I'm so happy for you, honey.
- Thank you.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.889
I love you.
Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!

23:06.053 --> 23:08.410
- Oh, what the hell.
- Oh, come on.

23:09.617 --> 23:11.495
- I love you guys.
- I love you.

23:11.659 --> 23:15.736
Okay, it's zero hour!
All teams execute on my count!

23:15.903 --> 23:19.262
Let's get this bad boy on the road!

23:19.426 --> 23:21.784
Is it okay I want you
to wear that headset in bed?

23:21.949 --> 23:24.546
I have you scheduled for nudity
at 2300 hours.

23:24.712 --> 23:25.987
Oh, yeah.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.355
Okay, Marjorie, hit it.

23:38.766 --> 23:42.683
- Jeez, Ross. You could've showered.
- It's the dog.

23:45.092 --> 23:48.132
Groomsman? Why are you standing
there? Where's your bridesmaid?

23:48.295 --> 23:51.210
We've got a broken arrow!
Bridesmaid down!

23:51.418 --> 23:53.490
Oh, that's me.

23:57.905 --> 24:00.467
- Ready?
- Okay.

24:00.628 --> 24:03.463
Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.

24:07.074 --> 24:09.875
Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold?

24:10.037 --> 24:11.312
I don't care.

24:11.478 --> 24:14.200
I'll be my "something blue."

24:17.605 --> 24:20.326
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

24:59.126 --> 25:00.880
My God.

25:01.408 --> 25:03.527
Aren't you freezing?

25:08.536 --> 25:11.336
Friends. Family.

25:11.498 --> 25:13.297
Dog.

25:14.782 --> 25:17.663
Thank you all for being here
to witness this blessed event.

25:18.425 --> 25:21.580
The cold has now spread
to my special place...

25:24.031 --> 25:26.069
...so I'm gonna do
the short version of this.

25:27.434 --> 25:29.553
Phoebe and Mike
are perfect for each other.

25:29.717 --> 25:31.914
And I know I speak for everyone here...

25:32.079 --> 25:35.678
...when I wish them
a lifetime of happiness.

25:35.843 --> 25:37.915
Who has the rings?

25:42.089 --> 25:43.649
Okay.

25:45.412 --> 25:49.375
When I was growing up,
I didn't have a normal mom and dad...

25:49.537 --> 25:52.337
...or a regular family like everybody else.

25:52.499 --> 25:55.779
And I always knew
that something was missing.

25:57.665 --> 25:59.942
But now I'm standing here today...

26:00.107 --> 26:03.899
...knowing that I have everything
I'm ever gonna need.

26:04.231 --> 26:06.463
You are my family.

26:15.242 --> 26:17.554
Phoebe, you are so beautiful.

26:17.725 --> 26:20.686
You're so kind. You're so generous.

26:20.848 --> 26:23.159
You're so wonderfully weird.

26:25.693 --> 26:28.529
Every day with you is an adventure.

26:28.696 --> 26:31.417
And I can't believe how lucky I am.

26:31.579 --> 26:34.938
And I can't wait
to share my life with you forever.

26:37.745 --> 26:40.215
Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And...

26:40.387 --> 26:41.742
...I love you.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.103
And you have nice eyes.

26:46.714 --> 26:48.627
I love you too.

26:48.916 --> 26:50.396
- Joey?
- Yeah?

26:50.558 --> 26:53.712
Chappy's heart rate
has slowed way down.

26:55.402 --> 26:57.794
Okay. Phoebe...

26:57.965 --> 27:00.641
...do you take this man
to be your husband?

27:00.808 --> 27:02.367
I do.

27:04.932 --> 27:08.849
Mike, do you take this woman
to be your wife?

27:09.016 --> 27:10.770
I do.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.776
I now pronounce you...

27:14.942 --> 27:17.903
...husband and wife.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.390
I got married!

27:30.277 --> 27:33.158
Could someone get me a coat?
I'm frigging freezing.

27:41.569 --> 27:43.641
- It really was an incredible wedding.
- It was.

27:43.811 --> 27:45.883
I kind of don't want it to end.
Hey...

27:46.053 --> 27:48.968
...you wanna come in for a drink
and a bite of corsage?

27:49.817 --> 27:51.730
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours...

27:51.899 --> 27:55.451
...and I'm about to have the most
organized sex anyone's ever had.

27:55.663 --> 27:57.781
- Whatever happened to Ross?
- I don't know.

27:57.945 --> 28:00.256
Maybe he hooked up with that
hot girl he talked to.

28:00.427 --> 28:02.739
Come on, Chappy! Do your business!

28:02.910 --> 28:04.550
Make!

28:05.152 --> 28:06.951
Make!

28:08.836 --> 28:11.147
I did not sign on for this.

28:11.358 --> 28:12.679
