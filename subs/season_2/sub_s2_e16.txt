WEBVTT

00:03.988 --> 00:05.364
Man, this is weird.

00:05.615 --> 00:08.242
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

00:08.492 --> 00:09.577
That's what's weird?

00:09.827 --> 00:14.290
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

00:17.043 --> 00:18.044
What?

00:18.294 --> 00:22.465
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

00:23.382 --> 00:25.509
You licked and you put.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.220
Yeah, so?

00:27.470 --> 00:32.183
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

00:32.433 --> 00:35.311
You used my toothbrush?

00:35.478 --> 00:40.066
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

00:40.316 --> 00:42.818
Mine is the red one!

00:43.069 --> 00:48.282
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

00:48.532 --> 00:50.910
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

00:51.160 --> 00:53.120
...but we can use the same soap?

00:53.371 --> 00:57.875
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.752
The next time you shower...

01:00.002 --> 01:05.424
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

01:06.092 --> 01:09.220
The One Where Joey Moves Out

01:54.534 --> 01:57.620
Look at you fancy lads!

01:57.870 --> 01:58.913
What's the occasion?

01:59.163 --> 02:02.792
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

02:03.042 --> 02:05.753
He's having a brunch.

02:06.004 --> 02:08.464
Ready when you are.

02:08.715 --> 02:11.259
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

02:11.509 --> 02:13.511
You guys are getting tattoos?

02:13.761 --> 02:17.098
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

02:17.348 --> 02:20.143
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

02:20.393 --> 02:23.354
I'm getting a lily.

02:23.605 --> 02:27.108
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

02:27.358 --> 02:32.155
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

02:32.655 --> 02:34.449
- Where you getting it?
- On my shoulder.

02:34.699 --> 02:35.825
What?

02:36.075 --> 02:38.161
What's on your shoulder?

02:38.411 --> 02:40.914
A chip.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.355
I've got a big attitude problem.

02:46.023 --> 02:48.901
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
- A tattoo?

02:49.151 --> 02:52.947
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

02:53.113 --> 02:55.157
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

02:55.407 --> 02:57.243
No. Sorry, I don't.

02:57.493 --> 03:00.788
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

03:01.038 --> 03:03.082
What if it doesn't come out right?

03:03.332 --> 03:07.962
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.589
Why is everyone staring at me?

03:10.840 --> 03:13.300
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

03:13.551 --> 03:15.386
Richard's going to the party too?

03:15.636 --> 03:17.972
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

03:18.222 --> 03:21.475
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

03:21.725 --> 03:26.438
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.983
No, I think you should tell them.

03:29.233 --> 03:32.611
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

03:32.862 --> 03:35.156
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

03:35.406 --> 03:38.367
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said...

03:38.617 --> 03:41.996
..."God, I hope they get together."

03:45.803 --> 03:48.114
- Hello.
- It's me. I'm double parked.

03:48.149 --> 03:49.843
- Okay. Come on Ross.
- Bye guys.

03:49.878 --> 03:50.731
See ya.

03:52.468 --> 03:54.995
- Bye, you.
- Bye.

04:00.961 --> 04:02.418
Bye you.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.664
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

04:15.799 --> 04:17.445
Okay, wait.

04:18.932 --> 04:20.224
It's gonna be fine.

04:20.543 --> 04:22.495
How can you say that?
Are you not nervous?

04:22.644 --> 04:25.376
I'm terrified.
This is just a very absorbant suit.

04:26.409 --> 04:27.873
Shall we?

04:28.644 --> 04:30.063
You know what?

04:30.313 --> 04:33.483
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.986
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

04:37.236 --> 04:42.408
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.702
We're here!

04:44.952 --> 04:47.789
- Hi, kids!
- The children!

04:48.039 --> 04:51.042
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.126
Happy birthday!

04:52.377 --> 04:54.837
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

04:55.088 --> 05:00.551
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.720
So you kids take the train in?

05:02.970 --> 05:05.431
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

05:05.682 --> 05:06.974
Speaking of whom...

05:07.225 --> 05:12.647
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

05:14.899 --> 05:16.984
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

05:17.235 --> 05:21.114
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

05:21.572 --> 05:25.284
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

05:25.535 --> 05:26.994
Are we still on that?

05:27.245 --> 05:31.124
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.792
She's probably not even pretty.

05:33.042 --> 05:38.297
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.180
<i>Can you believe this place?</i>

05:46.431 --> 05:48.266
I know. This is a great apartment.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.394
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

05:51.644 --> 05:55.273
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.359
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.987
Seriously.

06:01.863 --> 06:03.865
We were just saying, great apartment!

06:04.115 --> 06:06.034
Thanks. You want it?

06:06.284 --> 06:07.744
I'm moving to a bigger place.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.079
You should take this one.

06:10.330 --> 06:12.457
Can you see me in a place like this?

06:12.707 --> 06:15.793
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

06:16.044 --> 06:19.589
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

06:19.756 --> 06:22.258
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.509
On TV.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.138
Stop talking. Okay!

06:27.388 --> 06:29.891
- Come on, tell us!
- Is she really 20?

06:30.141 --> 06:32.018
I am not telling you guys anything.

06:32.268 --> 06:35.563
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

06:35.813 --> 06:37.899
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

06:38.149 --> 06:40.818
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

06:41.069 --> 06:42.528
Would you let it go?

06:42.779 --> 06:46.157
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.243
You got your own little speedster.

06:49.494 --> 06:52.372
- Seriously, it's not like that.
- Tell you what.

06:52.622 --> 06:56.584
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could...

06:56.834 --> 06:59.337
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

06:59.587 --> 07:01.297
What? I'm kidding!

07:01.547 --> 07:05.885
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.977
Okay, Rach.

07:14.227 --> 07:17.063
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

07:17.313 --> 07:19.607
- Well, I...
- I like this lily.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.277
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

07:22.527 --> 07:25.238
She had a more open, giving spirit.

07:25.488 --> 07:29.033
Foghorn Leghorn!

07:29.242 --> 07:31.411
Blonde girl?
You're in room two.

07:31.661 --> 07:34.622
Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.250
Here we go!

07:37.500 --> 07:40.128
You're not going.

07:40.378 --> 07:43.965
Is this because of what Ross said?

07:45.258 --> 07:47.802
- Well, yeah, maybe.
- I don't believe this.

07:48.052 --> 07:52.807
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

07:53.057 --> 07:55.560
Come on, what is this, 1922?

07:55.810 --> 07:57.770
What's 1922?

07:58.021 --> 08:01.524
Just, you know, a long time ago.

08:01.816 --> 08:05.111
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

08:05.361 --> 08:10.450
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.745
Do you want this tattoo?

08:13.995 --> 08:16.831
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross...

08:17.081 --> 08:20.543
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

08:22.253 --> 08:25.340
Who is the boss of you?

08:25.340 --> 08:28.051
You?

08:28.051 --> 08:30.094
You are the boss of you!

08:30.345 --> 08:33.640
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

08:33.890 --> 08:36.809
Go!

08:38.918 --> 08:41.203
I haven't even got my tattoo yet
and I'm already tougher.

08:47.497 --> 08:48.665
How you doing?

08:48.915 --> 08:51.376
I'm a twinkie!

08:51.626 --> 08:55.422
Really? I'm a hero.

08:56.631 --> 08:58.300
This is so hard.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.636
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

09:01.887 --> 09:04.556
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

09:04.806 --> 09:07.768
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

09:08.018 --> 09:10.520
My parents are dead.

09:10.771 --> 09:14.608
God, you are so lucky!

09:14.816 --> 09:17.569
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

09:17.819 --> 09:20.197
Just hang in there, okay?

09:20.447 --> 09:24.618
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

09:28.538 --> 09:33.335
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

09:35.003 --> 09:40.258
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

09:42.844 --> 09:44.471
Honey.

09:44.721 --> 09:47.724
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

09:47.975 --> 09:49.810
I have no idea.

09:50.060 --> 09:53.981
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

09:54.356 --> 09:58.360
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from <i>Cocoon</i>.

09:58.610 --> 10:01.822
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

10:02.072 --> 10:04.908
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

10:05.158 --> 10:08.704
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

10:08.954 --> 10:11.456
- Really?
- I've never seen him this happy.

10:11.707 --> 10:13.333
So, Jack...

10:13.583 --> 10:16.211
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

10:16.461 --> 10:18.547
Of course not.

10:18.797 --> 10:22.884
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.514
Oh, Jack, stop!

10:27.764 --> 10:30.058
Come on!

10:30.309 --> 10:34.271
It's my birthday!

10:36.982 --> 10:38.150
Can we drop this?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.652
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

10:40.902 --> 10:45.157
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

10:45.407 --> 10:46.241
You want it.

10:46.491 --> 10:48.577
Why would I want another apartment?

10:48.827 --> 10:50.996
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

10:51.246 --> 10:54.917
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

10:57.127 --> 11:01.965
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

11:02.215 --> 11:03.800
- What?
- I'm sorry.

11:04.051 --> 11:06.887
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

11:07.137 --> 11:10.057
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

11:10.307 --> 11:13.018
...that I don't need a roommate.

11:13.268 --> 11:15.270
I don't need a roommate either.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.065
I can afford to live here by myself.

11:18.315 --> 11:22.819
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

11:23.070 --> 11:25.239
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

11:25.489 --> 11:27.783
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

11:28.033 --> 11:31.203
We're not Bert and Ernie.

11:31.757 --> 11:35.077
I'm aware that we're
not gay puppets. All right?

11:36.887 --> 11:37.929
You know what?

11:38.180 --> 11:39.973
If this is the way you feel...

11:40.223 --> 11:42.726
...then maybe you should take it.

11:42.976 --> 11:45.103
- That's how I feel.
- Then maybe you should take it!

11:45.354 --> 11:46.229
Maybe I will!

11:46.480 --> 11:47.814
- Fine with me!
- Great!

11:48.065 --> 11:50.776
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

11:51.026 --> 11:53.487
...the spoons!

11:53.737 --> 11:57.366
Whose drink can I freshen?

11:57.491 --> 12:00.911
Almost time for cake!

12:10.128 --> 12:11.713
Mon, are you okay?

12:11.964 --> 12:16.176
You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

12:16.426 --> 12:20.305
Well, I just caught the live show.

12:24.524 --> 12:27.068
- Hey, there.
- What?

12:27.319 --> 12:32.115
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

12:32.365 --> 12:34.910
Really?

12:36.536 --> 12:39.998
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
- Not that I know of.

12:40.248 --> 12:45.253
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

12:47.380 --> 12:49.132
That's an idea.

12:49.382 --> 12:52.469
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

12:52.719 --> 12:55.514
Oh?

12:58.016 --> 12:59.851
She never tells us anything.

13:00.102 --> 13:02.521
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

13:02.771 --> 13:06.399
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

13:06.650 --> 13:09.319
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

13:09.569 --> 13:12.823
Is that crystal?

13:13.990 --> 13:16.243
So who's the mystery man?

13:16.493 --> 13:18.870
Well, he's a doctor.

13:19.121 --> 13:20.539
A real doctor?

13:20.789 --> 13:23.417
No, a doctor of meat.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.669
Of course he's a real doctor.

13:25.919 --> 13:28.213
And he's handsome.

13:28.463 --> 13:31.216
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

13:31.466 --> 13:34.970
Well, that's wonderful.

13:39.474 --> 13:41.518
Mom, it's okay.

13:41.768 --> 13:42.727
It is, Judy.

13:42.978 --> 13:45.981
Jack!

13:46.356 --> 13:49.276
Could you come in here for a moment?

13:49.526 --> 13:51.153
Now!

13:51.403 --> 13:55.574
- Found it!
- I'll take that, Dad.

13:57.701 --> 14:02.497
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

14:02.748 --> 14:07.294
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

14:07.544 --> 14:09.004
I'm the twinkie.

14:09.254 --> 14:11.673
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie!

14:11.923 --> 14:14.634
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in...

14:14.885 --> 14:17.596
Oh, please! A relationship?

14:17.846 --> 14:19.222
Yes, a relationship!

14:19.473 --> 14:21.683
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

14:21.933 --> 14:24.436
Really?

14:25.187 --> 14:29.524
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

14:29.775 --> 14:33.904
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

14:34.154 --> 14:34.946
When did I say that?

14:35.197 --> 14:39.618
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

14:39.868 --> 14:42.204
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

14:42.454 --> 14:45.999
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

14:46.249 --> 14:50.796
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jack</i>

14:51.046 --> 14:56.635
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

14:56.885 --> 15:00.138
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

15:00.389 --> 15:03.433
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

15:03.683 --> 15:07.104
Okay, let me see yours.

15:09.272 --> 15:11.650
Let's see yours again.

15:11.900 --> 15:16.071
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

15:17.406 --> 15:19.700
Oh, no!

15:19.950 --> 15:22.285
It's gone! That's so weird.

15:22.536 --> 15:26.498
I don't know how, where it went.

15:27.541 --> 15:29.918
You didn't get it?

15:30.419 --> 15:31.294
Why not?

15:31.545 --> 15:33.005
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

15:33.255 --> 15:35.757
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

15:36.008 --> 15:39.553
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

15:39.803 --> 15:43.432
And did you know
they do this with needles?

15:43.682 --> 15:45.350
Really? You don't say?

15:45.600 --> 15:50.063
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

15:51.150 --> 15:53.184
Seriously, does it hurt a lot?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.809
No, it's just like a pinch.
Like that.

15:56.829 --> 15:57.692
Oh, my God!

15:59.559 --> 16:03.120
That really hurt me!
That's gonna leave a mark.

16:08.241 --> 16:09.701
I'm sorry about what...

16:09.951 --> 16:12.912
- Yeah, me too.
- I know.

16:15.290 --> 16:18.209
Do we need to hug?

16:18.585 --> 16:21.630
No, we're all right.

16:21.630 --> 16:24.299
So I got you something.

16:24.549 --> 16:27.385
Plastic spoons!

16:28.219 --> 16:31.681
- Great!
- Lick away, my man!

16:31.931 --> 16:36.227
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

16:36.478 --> 16:37.771
What?

16:38.021 --> 16:42.609
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

16:42.859 --> 16:45.946
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

16:46.196 --> 16:47.948
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

16:48.198 --> 16:51.660
I didn't think that was serious.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.913
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

16:55.163 --> 16:56.831
Well, it was a fight...

16:57.082 --> 16:59.334
...based on serious stuff, remember?

16:59.584 --> 17:01.711
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

17:01.962 --> 17:05.173
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

17:05.423 --> 17:08.051
...or whatever.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.974
Well, there you go.

17:14.182 --> 17:16.434
Hey, are you cool with this?

17:16.685 --> 17:18.395
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

17:18.645 --> 17:21.940
I've never been lower or wetter.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.985
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

17:25.235 --> 17:26.778
...bedroom into a game room.

17:27.028 --> 17:30.865
Put the foosball table in there.

17:31.157 --> 17:34.828
Why do you get to keep the table?

17:35.954 --> 17:39.624
I did pay for half of it.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.669
I paid for the other half.

17:42.919 --> 17:46.256
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

17:46.506 --> 17:47.674
All right, you're on.

17:47.924 --> 17:52.053
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

17:52.304 --> 17:57.350
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

18:03.356 --> 18:06.484
Which sister?

18:08.403 --> 18:10.655
So are you sorry that I told them?

18:10.906 --> 18:16.536
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

18:19.456 --> 18:20.457
Did you get it?

18:20.707 --> 18:22.500
- Is Ross here?
- He went out for pizza.

18:22.751 --> 18:25.712
Okay, really quick.

18:25.879 --> 18:26.922
That's great!

18:27.172 --> 18:29.216
Very tasteful.

18:29.466 --> 18:31.301
Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?

18:31.551 --> 18:33.178
What? You didn't get one.

18:33.428 --> 18:37.599
Okay. Well then, what is this?

18:38.433 --> 18:40.644
What are we looking at?

18:40.894 --> 18:44.272
That blue freckle?

18:44.356 --> 18:45.690
That's my tattoo.

18:45.941 --> 18:48.693
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.278
I got her in the chair...

18:50.529 --> 18:54.407
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

18:54.658 --> 18:57.827
Okay, hi!

18:58.370 --> 19:02.582
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

19:02.832 --> 19:08.088
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

19:08.588 --> 19:12.175
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

19:12.425 --> 19:16.263
Oh, what a load of crap!

19:16.513 --> 19:17.889
That is a dot!

19:18.139 --> 19:24.312
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

19:24.813 --> 19:29.401
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

19:32.362 --> 19:35.198
You got a tattoo?

19:35.448 --> 19:37.617
Maybe.

19:37.868 --> 19:42.247
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

19:42.831 --> 19:46.001
Well, let me see.

19:47.836 --> 19:49.171
Well?

19:49.421 --> 19:52.465
Well, it's really...

19:52.674 --> 19:54.092
...sexy.

19:54.342 --> 19:57.387
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

19:57.637 --> 20:00.265
...wow!

20:01.725 --> 20:04.102
Really?

20:05.103 --> 20:09.649
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

20:10.901 --> 20:12.527
I guess.

20:12.777 --> 20:15.489
Save us some pizza.

20:20.827 --> 20:23.747
Get it out of the corner!

20:24.080 --> 20:25.457
Pass it! Pass it!

20:25.707 --> 20:29.169
Stop talking to your men!

20:30.337 --> 20:33.632
And the table is mine.

20:36.176 --> 20:39.387
Congratulations.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.901
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

20:53.151 --> 20:54.861
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

20:55.111 --> 20:57.781
We'll be over there all the time.

20:58.031 --> 21:01.660
Except when we are here.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.833
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

21:08.083 --> 21:11.169
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

21:11.419 --> 21:15.590
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines...

21:15.841 --> 21:19.219
Is that my bra?

21:19.845 --> 21:23.640
- What are you doing with my bra?
- It's not what you think.

21:23.890 --> 21:27.936
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

21:28.186 --> 21:32.315
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

21:32.566 --> 21:35.235
Yeah, I remember.

21:36.528 --> 21:41.116
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

21:51.752 --> 21:53.587
You want me to...

21:53.837 --> 21:57.591
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

21:57.799 --> 22:02.095
You keep it.
You need the practice.

22:03.054 --> 22:04.765
Thanks.

22:05.015 --> 22:06.683
So...

22:06.933 --> 22:08.393
...I guess this is it.

22:08.643 --> 22:09.644
Yeah, right.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.731
I guess so.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.195
When am I gonna see you?

22:18.445 --> 22:20.530
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

22:20.781 --> 22:23.909
Right. Yeah. Okay.

22:24.159 --> 22:27.204
Take care.

23:05.298 --> 23:07.534
Hey, dad.
What are you doing here?

23:07.714 --> 23:10.611
I just stopped by your boyfriend's
to give him a piece of my mind.

23:11.404 --> 23:11.887
And?

23:11.922 --> 23:14.066
And I was gonna
punch him in the nose.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.276
But he had the game on,
so we started watching.

23:18.444 --> 23:21.142
Then at half-time,
I was gonna give him what for.

23:21.514 --> 23:23.476
But he offered me a beer
and you know what?

23:23.566 --> 23:25.753
- What?
- He's got it on tap!

23:26.919 --> 23:30.255
Right in his apartment. The damn
thing is built right into his bar.

23:30.315 --> 23:31.515
It's unbelievable.

23:31.691 --> 23:33.591
Dad, did you talk about me?

23:34.026 --> 23:38.820
Oh, right.
Well, actually, we never got to you.

23:39.398 --> 23:43.935
Look, you're a big girl. I just hope
you know what you're doing.

23:44.203 --> 23:46.003
I do.

23:47.140 --> 23:51.201
Dad, you're wearing the tie
that I got you.

23:51.978 --> 23:54.178
So where did you get the hat?

23:57.884 --> 23:59.709
I don't know.
