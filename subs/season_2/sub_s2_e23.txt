WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:04.766
Chandler, Mon, there's only one
banana-nut muffin left.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.132
I ordered mine first.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.432
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

00:09.877 --> 00:10.809
Give it to me.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.108
No.

00:12.747 --> 00:13.907
Give it to me!

00:14.782 --> 00:16.477
Okay, you can have it.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.517
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

00:27.962 --> 00:30.260
That was there when I got here.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.959
Hey, you'll never guess
who's coming to New York.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.829
Quick, tell us before he swallows.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.968
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.137
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

00:45.346 --> 00:47.814
I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

00:48.015 --> 00:51.348
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.646
Is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

00:56.557 --> 01:00.323
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every couple years...

01:00.528 --> 01:03.190
...and we have an amazing
three days together.

01:03.397 --> 01:08.164
Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!

01:09.837 --> 01:12.897
So this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

01:16.544 --> 01:18.671
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.047
Hi.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.647
Oh, no. What happened?

01:26.854 --> 01:29.322
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chickenpox.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.512
Oh, no.

01:30.724 --> 01:34.057
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you'll get it.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.990
-I've had it.
-I've had it.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.186
-Had it.
-Had it.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.731
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look!

01:44.438 --> 01:46.531
The One With the Chicken Pox

02:34.222 --> 02:36.884
Honey, you made the bed again.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.422
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

02:40.662 --> 02:44.723
Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

02:46.334 --> 02:50.896
I'm taking a shower. Today I'll
sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."

03:03.017 --> 03:05.247
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.688
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

03:08.890 --> 03:10.881
...or the fattest man?

03:11.859 --> 03:16.023
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."

03:16.798 --> 03:17.787
What are you doing?

03:19.701 --> 03:22.568
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.200
Are you remaking the bed?

03:27.942 --> 03:31.070
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.711
Then you're redoing it
because...?

03:33.982 --> 03:35.609
You'll think I'm crazy.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.613
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.046
Okay. You see...

03:42.991 --> 03:45.960
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

03:46.160 --> 03:48.720
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

03:49.731 --> 03:52.165
-That's not so crazy.
-I'm just easing you in.

03:53.001 --> 03:53.933
All right.

03:54.769 --> 03:56.896
You see these little flower blossoms?

03:57.105 --> 03:59.096
They should be facing up not down...

03:59.340 --> 04:02.969
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

04:06.848 --> 04:08.782
You don't love me anymore, do you?

04:11.019 --> 04:14.113
Actually, if it's possible,
I love you more.

04:14.789 --> 04:15.619
Really?

04:17.692 --> 04:19.683
Wow. Well, then, come on!

04:19.994 --> 04:23.259
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.636
If you need something
to hold you over...

04:29.937 --> 04:32.804
...I can get you a job here
as an entry-level processor.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.871
Don't you need experience like this?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.440
It's not hard to learn.

04:36.711 --> 04:40.442
As for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, you're an actor.

04:40.648 --> 04:44.209
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.885
Here's this morning's projections.

04:48.089 --> 04:50.649
Thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.753
Joey is a fellow processor.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.554
No kidding?

04:59.433 --> 05:03.301
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.903
-Where do you work?
-Well, I'm in between things.

05:08.176 --> 05:11.509
You know, one day you're processing,
the next day...

05:11.746 --> 05:13.976
...you're not so much
processing anymore.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.150
I told Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.978
Fleischman's group.

05:19.187 --> 05:22.350
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.688
Are all you processors dorks?

05:33.768 --> 05:36.328
This lipstick looks just great on you.

05:37.138 --> 05:39.106
You look fabulous.
You really do.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.932
Yeah, are you sure?
Really?

05:44.045 --> 05:47.208
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.973
I'm hideous!

05:51.185 --> 05:52.550
It's gonna be okay.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.344
Ryan's been underwater.

05:54.555 --> 05:58.150
He's just gonna be glad you don't
have barnacles on your butt.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.670
Come in.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.664
Hey, baby, I'm back

06:14.876 --> 06:16.810
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

06:19.647 --> 06:20.671
What's going on?

06:20.882 --> 06:23.680
No, no.
You have to stay back.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.250
I have the pox!

06:28.055 --> 06:29.920
Chicken or small?

06:30.524 --> 06:33.925
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

06:35.529 --> 06:39.021
-Why aren't you home in bed?
-My grandmother's never had chickenpox.

06:39.433 --> 06:43.836
Please tell me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.840
I'm sorry, I never had them.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.846
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

06:53.080 --> 06:57.881
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and rub that kid all over my face.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.211
Yeah, or you could wish
that I didn't have them now.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.351
Can I please see your face?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.390
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.789
It could be lox, I wouldn't care.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.856
And you hate fish.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.630
So sweet. All right.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.098
Okay, all right.
You can see.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.871
This is me.

07:25.813 --> 07:26.905
Sorry!

07:27.782 --> 07:29.044
I am scary!

07:29.250 --> 07:31.912
The lightening was
an unfortunate coincidence.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.889
You look lovely!
Lovely!

07:36.090 --> 07:37.250
I hate this.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.885
I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

07:41.095 --> 07:44.587
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.129
I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

07:51.839 --> 07:53.966
...thinking about this moment.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.099
I am not gonna let a bunch...

07:57.311 --> 07:59.575
...of itchy spots stand between us.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.446
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

08:17.198 --> 08:19.860
-How's the first day?
-Good. It's like you said.

08:20.101 --> 08:23.002
It's putting numbers
from one column into another.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.328
There you go.

08:24.538 --> 08:29.100
And everybody's nice. I just had
a good talk with that lady Jeannie.

08:29.510 --> 08:33.002
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast operations, Jeannie?

08:33.214 --> 08:35.682
Turns out our kids go
to the same school.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.717
Yeah. Small world, huh?

08:42.023 --> 08:43.285
Weird world.

08:44.425 --> 08:45.357
Your kids?

08:45.726 --> 08:48.194
I figure my character has kids.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.795
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need explained.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.960
When you're acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

08:57.171 --> 08:59.537
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

09:00.674 --> 09:03.837
... has two little girls,
Ashley and Brittany.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.640
Ashley copies everything
Brittany does.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.652
Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

09:18.092 --> 09:22.552
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.060
You know what?

09:24.899 --> 09:25.991
Just did.

09:27.568 --> 09:31.436
That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

09:43.682 --> 09:45.616
You Know what makes the itching worse?

09:46.085 --> 09:48.679
That you don't stop talking about it?

09:49.822 --> 09:52.120
-Fine.
-Let's just play, okay?

09:52.825 --> 09:53.655
Good, okay.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.458
Here we go, double sixes.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.687
Here we go....

09:59.999 --> 10:00.988
Here we go....

10:01.200 --> 10:04.328
Come to Mama.
Getting ready to roll the dice....

10:05.037 --> 10:07.164
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

10:07.373 --> 10:10.206
No. This is what I do
for luck, okay?

10:11.277 --> 10:12.676
You're scratching.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.139
Give me the dice.

10:14.346 --> 10:16.871
-Give me the dice.
-No! Here. There!

10:17.116 --> 10:18.549
Look, double sixes!

10:20.152 --> 10:22.382
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.485
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

10:26.725 --> 10:30.024
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.854
-No!
-Give it!

10:32.064 --> 10:33.361
Come on!

10:33.566 --> 10:36.296
You know you want it.
You know you want it too.

10:36.502 --> 10:38.993
Let's just be bad.
It'll feel so good.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.672
Come on.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.737
Oh, God, help me.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.679
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay, good. Now do me.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.713
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

10:50.916 --> 10:51.848
There you go.

10:52.051 --> 10:52.983
-Don't move.
-Why?

10:53.185 --> 10:55.210
-Don't move.
-What are you...?

10:59.358 --> 11:01.758
Stop that.
Stop that right now.

11:02.161 --> 11:06.359
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

11:09.359 --> 11:10.359
She make me doing.

11:10.959 --> 11:15.959
-That's a nice color on you.
-You will become pink and blunch baby.

11:16.359 --> 11:18.870
I hope you get a Winnie pork.

11:22.870 --> 11:26.567
You and Milton have to join us
on the boat. Bring the kids.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.273
We'll make a day of it.

11:28.508 --> 11:31.204
That sounds lovely.
We'll have to set it up.

11:31.411 --> 11:34.107
I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

11:34.348 --> 11:36.009
Thanks.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.377
-Bye-bye, Jeannie.
-Bye-bye, Joseph.

11:39.019 --> 11:40.577
What a phony.

11:43.557 --> 11:47.049
You'll teach her a lesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

11:48.695 --> 11:50.424
-Hey, Mr. Douglas.
-Sir.

11:50.631 --> 11:55.034
Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna
see the report until next Friday?

11:55.235 --> 11:57.863
My group wants to spend
the holiday with family.

11:58.105 --> 12:00.903
I have a family.
I'm gonna be here.

12:01.108 --> 12:03.269
Yeah, Bing.
What's that about?

12:08.248 --> 12:11.274
It's about cutting them
a little slack for morale.

12:11.585 --> 12:14.383
Look, I can get some
rough numbers by Wednesday.

12:14.621 --> 12:16.646
Rough numbers?

12:17.758 --> 12:21.819
This company wasn't built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

12:22.396 --> 12:25.229
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

12:25.432 --> 12:27.127
If you say so, sir.

12:28.335 --> 12:30.428
Joseph's good, isn't he?

12:32.506 --> 12:34.167
I'm going to kill you.

12:35.275 --> 12:39.678
Hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

12:39.913 --> 12:43.144
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

12:44.351 --> 12:45.579
Why?

12:47.521 --> 12:50.684
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.316
Okay? If you try to pull something...

12:53.760 --> 12:55.421
... he'll call you on it.

12:55.929 --> 12:58.420
"What are you trying to pull?"
he'll say.

13:03.837 --> 13:04.667
Duct tape.

13:05.205 --> 13:07.139
Was I supposed to bring something too?

13:08.642 --> 13:12.476
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.147
You're strict.

13:15.349 --> 13:17.214
Well, it's for their own good.

13:17.451 --> 13:21.979
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

13:22.289 --> 13:26.555
See, in a tape emergency you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

13:28.028 --> 13:29.791
Exactly!

13:30.330 --> 13:34.232
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

13:35.068 --> 13:36.057
Tell me the truth.

13:36.336 --> 13:39.533
Don't you like having everything
on your desk perpendicular?

13:39.740 --> 13:42.903
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

13:43.844 --> 13:44.902
-Very good.
-Thank you.

13:45.178 --> 13:47.840
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

13:48.815 --> 13:50.680
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

13:50.984 --> 13:52.349
Set them to my time.

13:54.921 --> 13:55.979
I'm confused.

13:56.223 --> 13:58.487
I thought we shared time.

13:59.359 --> 14:03.693
No. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

14:03.930 --> 14:04.828
Wanna know why?

14:05.065 --> 14:09.502
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

14:09.770 --> 14:10.737
Forget it.

14:11.004 --> 14:12.266
No, come on, tell me.

14:12.539 --> 14:14.336
-You don't understand.
-Come on.

14:14.541 --> 14:16.566
You don't have any obsessive things.

14:16.777 --> 14:18.608
No, that's not true.

14:18.845 --> 14:20.938
Oh, yeah?
Tell me one of yours.

14:27.921 --> 14:32.449
One of my things is
I always separate my sweat socks...

14:32.726 --> 14:35.126
...from my dress socks.

14:38.065 --> 14:39.589
What if they get mixed up?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.734
Boy, I would just....

14:42.803 --> 14:44.100
I would freak out.

14:46.273 --> 14:47.740
You would not.

14:47.974 --> 14:51.569
I can't believe this.
I hate this. You're too normal.

14:51.778 --> 14:53.871
I can't believe you
don't have a "thing."

14:54.081 --> 14:56.641
My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing."

14:56.883 --> 15:00.080
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well.

15:09.329 --> 15:14.130
-Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
-Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

15:14.835 --> 15:18.396
He suspects you dropped the ball
on the Lender project.

15:19.272 --> 15:21.832
Why? Why does he suspect that?

15:22.943 --> 15:25.241
At first, he thought it was Joseph...

15:25.479 --> 15:29.006
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

15:31.084 --> 15:34.520
-Anyway, I thought you should know.
-All right. That's it.

15:34.754 --> 15:36.016
Look, Joey...

15:36.256 --> 15:39.123
... I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

15:39.326 --> 15:43.490
...and if I could just fire Joseph,
I would. But that's not possible.

15:43.697 --> 15:45.426
So I have to let you both go.

15:47.501 --> 15:49.526
What? Everybody loves Joseph.

15:49.769 --> 15:51.760
I don't. I hate Joseph.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.267
I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

15:57.777 --> 16:01.042
You can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

16:06.153 --> 16:09.452
All right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

16:10.023 --> 16:11.718
... but I can sleep with his wife.

16:15.195 --> 16:16.059
Not Karen!

16:16.363 --> 16:19.662
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

16:19.866 --> 16:21.060
You know what?

16:21.902 --> 16:22.732
I just did.

16:26.339 --> 16:28.102
What the hell are you doing?

16:28.308 --> 16:29.570
Oh, it's not me.

16:29.809 --> 16:31.140
It's my character!

16:32.078 --> 16:32.908
Chandie.

16:34.414 --> 16:37.713
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

16:37.918 --> 16:39.886
...and then laughs about it.

16:40.153 --> 16:43.589
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

16:43.823 --> 16:46.314
-Really?
-No, freak show, she's fictional!

16:47.894 --> 16:48.986
Take it easy.

16:49.496 --> 16:53.899
If it means that much to you,
I'll go find something else.

16:54.901 --> 16:56.198
Thank you.

16:58.071 --> 17:01.529
It's just that
I'm gonna miss Joseph.

17:02.242 --> 17:04.437
I liked him. His wife.

17:04.744 --> 17:06.006
She was hot.

17:08.006 --> 17:11.006
And the kids, you gonna put a pour like summer.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.011
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.481
No, sorry, hon.
Monica's orders.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.483
Well, that wasn't easy.

17:26.928 --> 17:28.520
Okay, dinner's on.

17:29.497 --> 17:31.761
There's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

17:31.966 --> 17:36.096
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.670
All right, you kids.
Bye, now.

17:39.941 --> 17:41.772
-Bye.
-Oh, look, look.

17:41.976 --> 17:43.807
A low-budget puppet show.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.040
A shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

17:53.488 --> 17:55.353
-Wine?
-Please.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.832
-Spilled some.
-I got it.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.514
You look beautiful tonight.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.014
What?

18:25.086 --> 18:25.984
Sorry.

18:29.223 --> 18:30.247
You look beautiful.

18:47.408 --> 18:49.740
You know what? That's it.
That's it.

18:57.785 --> 18:58.615
Oh, yes.

19:01.089 --> 19:01.919
Good.

19:07.695 --> 19:09.026
You guys, did you?

19:18.906 --> 19:19.736
Monica...

19:19.974 --> 19:21.066
...wake up.

19:22.376 --> 19:23.604
What's up?

19:23.811 --> 19:25.142
I thought of a thing.

19:29.517 --> 19:30.449
Yeah?

19:32.120 --> 19:36.284
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

19:38.292 --> 19:41.284
No. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

19:41.562 --> 19:44.463
... because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.062
Or so I would have you believe.

19:52.273 --> 19:56.107
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

19:56.344 --> 19:59.245
Hey, come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

19:59.647 --> 20:01.342
All right, go on.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.014
I have to sleep on the west side...

20:05.253 --> 20:08.347
... because I grew up in California...

20:08.589 --> 20:10.181
...and otherwise...

20:10.691 --> 20:13.819
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.131
Oh, my God.

20:20.334 --> 20:22.199
You're a freak!

20:23.271 --> 20:24.670
How about that?

20:29.177 --> 20:30.701
Where're you shipping off to?

20:31.045 --> 20:32.205
I really can't say.

20:32.446 --> 20:34.676
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

20:35.383 --> 20:36.509
I can't say.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.616
Do you get to look through
a periscope thingy?

20:39.821 --> 20:41.686
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

20:41.889 --> 20:44.790
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.393
-I better not miss my flight.
-I'll walk you out.

20:48.629 --> 20:51.029
-Bye, Ryan.
-Pleasure. Take care.

20:56.704 --> 21:01.141
So do you think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

21:02.476 --> 21:04.068
You like that, do you?

21:04.345 --> 21:05.573
Oh, yeah.

21:05.813 --> 21:07.178
I'll make some calls.

21:09.684 --> 21:12.152
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

21:12.353 --> 21:14.184
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

21:14.388 --> 21:19.018
...Iike having a picnic in Central Park
and coffee at Central Perk.

21:19.227 --> 21:20.717
Oh, I just got that!

21:30.071 --> 21:31.402
Taxi!

21:37.511 --> 21:38.535
Bye, you.

21:52.026 --> 21:53.459
I'm sorry, we're

21:56.964 --> 21:58.158
Hey, sailor.

21:58.366 --> 21:59.993
Is this what you had in mind?

22:01.569 --> 22:02.399
I'll say.

22:08.476 --> 22:10.467
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

22:11.012 --> 22:12.343
Well, then...

22:14.582 --> 22:16.550
...we better make this night count.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.753
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

22:30.498 --> 22:32.227
Anchors aweigh.

22:34.435 --> 22:37.063
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

22:42.910 --> 22:45.504
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

22:45.713 --> 22:47.772
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

22:52.787 --> 22:53.719
Honey!
