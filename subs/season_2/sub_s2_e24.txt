WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.767
- Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
- Incredible!

00:04.972 --> 00:07.600
I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.970
- Who?
- All right. I'll give you one hint.

00:11.045 --> 00:11.977
Warren Beatty.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.507
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.282
See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.350
'Cause he was just so darn cute.

00:23.724 --> 00:27.990
No, as part of the audition.
See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.

00:28.229 --> 00:32.029
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.

00:36.604 --> 00:37.536
Or you just do it.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.834
I did do it, I'm a professional.

00:40.834 --> 00:45.834
Besides my first girlfriend was Lisa Dibertis,
so I am no stranger to the mustache.

00:48.075 --> 00:48.905
Then what's the problem?

00:49.143 --> 00:51.976
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says

00:52.312 --> 00:54.143
'good actor, bad kisser'.

00:54.882 --> 00:57.976
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser,

00:58.352 --> 01:02.254
that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.

01:04.191 --> 01:07.991
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.

01:12.991 --> 01:14.991
The one with Barry And Mindy's Wedding

02:00.616 --> 02:01.844
Hey, what did your agent say?

02:02.284 --> 02:06.983
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.951
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.

02:10.426 --> 02:13.224
Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.

02:13.495 --> 02:15.122
- What, forget it!
- Yeah, right.

02:15.965 --> 02:17.899
Come on, I need your help here.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.728
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.

02:22.004 --> 02:23.995
You see this, this is a friend.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.338
Uh-huh, let's go.

02:26.275 --> 02:27.765
Oh, wait I have gum.

02:29.511 --> 02:30.000
Okay.

02:39.154 --> 02:40.985
Good, very good, firm but tender.

02:41.824 --> 02:43.018
I'd recommend you to a friend.

02:45.427 --> 02:47.292
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

02:47.563 --> 02:49.895
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men,

02:50.132 --> 02:51.895
maybe you just tensed up a little,

02:52.401 --> 02:53.595
maybe that's what you need to work on.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.835
Yeah, that makes sense.

03:01.644 --> 03:03.077
Over my dead body!

03:07.049 --> 03:09.040
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

03:14.523 --> 03:17.287
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!

03:17.660 --> 03:19.218
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.330
Oh my God,

03:30.205 --> 03:31.763
you look so good!

03:33.575 --> 03:37.568
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people

03:37.880 --> 03:40.781
looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

03:42.051 --> 03:47.114
So don't,
I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

03:47.356 --> 03:49.449
Because I promised Mindy I would.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.957
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.

03:54.496 --> 03:57.226
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor.

03:57.599 --> 03:59.692
And besides you know what I just need

03:59.902 --> 04:03.201
to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

04:12.181 --> 04:15.981
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?

04:16.185 --> 04:19.279
- I may have.
- Woo-hoo, stuud!

04:20.122 --> 04:22.181
- What's she look like?
- Well, we haven't exactly met,

04:22.391 --> 04:24.586
we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

04:26.061 --> 04:27.551
Woo-hoo, geeek!

04:28.697 --> 04:31.427
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl,

04:31.867 --> 04:35.394
you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...

04:35.604 --> 04:37.538
- Get out!
- Nooo!

04:37.873 --> 04:41.900
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real',

04:43.112 --> 04:43.703
and I did.

04:46.315 --> 04:47.179
Wow! What's that like?

04:49.451 --> 04:50.213
It's like this,

04:50.919 --> 04:52.819
me, no jokes.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.187
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.

04:57.726 --> 04:59.921
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.

05:00.929 --> 05:04.262
- All right, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Richard.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.459
Bye sweetie,

05:06.235 --> 05:07.964
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

05:15.878 --> 05:17.607
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy,

05:19.782 --> 05:21.215
I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.

05:23.485 --> 05:25.749
What are you talking about? What wedding?

05:25.921 --> 05:27.548
Come on, like you never talk about that.

05:28.190 --> 05:30.021
Nooo! Never!

05:30.259 --> 05:32.124
I mean, we're living in the moment.

05:32.661 --> 05:36.529
God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'

05:37.032 --> 05:39.091
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

05:40.402 --> 05:42.893
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing,

05:43.338 --> 05:46.102
give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.

05:50.102 --> 05:55.102
I was laughing at this quip leno made last night.

05:56.102 --> 05:59.102
I was not laughing at your dress,
I love you.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.674
Where's Benny?

06:05.981 --> 06:07.312
There he is!

06:07.516 --> 06:09.347
Where's Benny,

06:09.785 --> 06:11.116
there he is.

06:13.923 --> 06:16.050
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk,

06:16.258 --> 06:17.987
so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.

06:20.596 --> 06:25.033
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.

06:25.234 --> 06:25.928
Okay.

06:27.603 --> 06:31.369
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?

06:32.174 --> 06:32.833
Sure I do.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.102
Yeah, am I in it?

06:36.545 --> 06:38.536
Honey, you are it.

06:40.216 --> 06:43.379
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.

06:48.457 --> 06:49.219
Keep talkin'.

06:49.592 --> 06:53.426
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice,

06:55.397 --> 06:57.422
we could move to France,

06:58.467 --> 07:00.059
make French toast.

07:01.637 --> 07:05.573
Okay, so, uh, we're in France,

07:06.375 --> 07:07.603
we're making the toast.

07:09.612 --> 07:12.206
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

07:13.315 --> 07:14.111
Like a hound?

07:16.952 --> 07:19.921
Not a basset, a bassinet.

07:22.491 --> 07:24.755
You really need the bassinet?

07:25.461 --> 07:28.726
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.897
Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.

07:34.103 --> 07:37.300
Oh, hey, I love children,

07:38.274 --> 07:39.298
I have children.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.707
I just don't want to be 70

07:41.877 --> 07:45.142
when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.

07:49.318 --> 07:53.186
Look I want you, now.

07:55.124 --> 07:55.886
That's Great.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.783
You know we don't need to talk about this now.

07:59.161 --> 08:02.790
Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future,

08:03.499 --> 08:06.696
I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.908
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.

08:15.311 --> 08:16.539
Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.707
Joey, no means no!

08:25.487 --> 08:27.648
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.

08:32.561 --> 08:34.188
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute

08:36.031 --> 08:37.555
And you, uh, you,

08:38.968 --> 08:41.528
- you I could eat with a spoon
- Get away from me I said no!

08:45.274 --> 08:47.367
- Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
- Oh, Richard's here.

08:48.143 --> 08:49.440
I should run down say bye to him

08:53.716 --> 08:55.047
Bye.

08:57.953 --> 08:59.921
So how's your date with your cyberchick going.

09:00.255 --> 09:01.517
Ooh, hey, what is all that?

09:01.724 --> 09:04.215
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum.

09:04.927 --> 09:06.656
See, she likes art,

09:07.830 --> 09:09.161
and I like funny words.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.766
What does she mean by HH?

09:14.136 --> 09:16.297
It means we're holding hands.

09:18.173 --> 09:19.640
Are you the cutest?

09:19.842 --> 09:21.434
I'm afraid I might just be.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.310
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person

09:28.484 --> 09:31.942
and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads,

09:33.889 --> 09:34.753
or. It could be a guy.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.423
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.

09:39.728 --> 09:41.491
It could be like a big giant guy.

09:45.100 --> 09:48.831
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.234
What's going on?

09:51.707 --> 09:53.971
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.478
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

09:57.079 --> 09:58.137
Women live longer than men.

10:02.651 --> 10:04.551
How do you not fall down more?

10:06.555 --> 10:09.456
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'

10:10.192 --> 10:10.817
All right.

10:15.064 --> 10:17.555
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

10:19.034 --> 10:19.898
She's married!

10:21.537 --> 10:22.799
Well at least we know she's a woman.

10:25.841 --> 10:27.399
I can't believe she's married.

10:28.043 --> 10:29.442
Aw, man I'm sorry.

10:32.047 --> 10:33.480
This must be very tough for ya, huh.

10:38.353 --> 10:43.256
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings,

10:43.692 --> 10:45.717
because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.

10:45.961 --> 10:48.486
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

10:50.799 --> 10:52.460
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.903
Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not going to be thinking about.

10:58.140 --> 10:58.765
Neither am I.

11:00.275 --> 11:02.175
Hi, there. Are you all right?

11:02.811 --> 11:06.975
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding,

11:07.683 --> 11:10.550
and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

11:10.986 --> 11:15.082
people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.815
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding,

11:17.993 --> 11:19.961
generally people focus on the bride.

11:20.963 --> 11:21.793
God I know, you're right.

11:21.997 --> 11:24.557
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.828
All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.

11:31.039 --> 11:32.666
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.365
- Okay, good luck
- Thank you

11:34.710 --> 11:36.871
Okay, Okay.

11:49.888 --> 11:51.412
Why the hell didn't you tell me!

11:51.589 --> 11:52.920
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do

11:53.124 --> 11:55.524
stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'

11:55.524 --> 11:58.861
Yeah, better than you embarrass and I will go.

11:58.861 --> 12:00.852
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.

12:01.063 --> 12:04.521
I think the only thing that tops that was, was,

12:04.733 --> 12:08.032
was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

12:08.204 --> 12:10.764
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.

12:10.973 --> 12:12.702
Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.

12:12.975 --> 12:15.842
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.

12:16.045 --> 12:19.242
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.345
Rachel!

12:22.318 --> 12:24.309
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.818
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear,

12:27.056 --> 12:29.752
in fact I hardly expected to see so much.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.091
You told me you didn't see anything.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.593
I tell ya a lot things!

12:36.899 --> 12:40.528
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.

12:41.003 --> 12:41.867
Stay well.

12:43.739 --> 12:47.573
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

12:47.876 --> 12:49.776
Rach! Rach!

12:50.646 --> 12:53.046
- Oh my God, I'm married!
- I know.

12:53.282 --> 12:55.614
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.

12:56.385 --> 12:58.819
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.

12:59.088 --> 12:59.554
Min.

13:01.023 --> 13:02.547
Oh Rach, you're still here,

13:02.925 --> 13:05.189
at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.

13:06.562 --> 13:08.257
Yeah, I love that story.

13:09.999 --> 13:11.466
Um, I got a question for you guys.

13:11.734 --> 13:14.066
Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?

13:15.471 --> 13:18.133
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding,

13:18.340 --> 13:22.401
Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.

13:23.946 --> 13:24.640
Insane!

13:25.314 --> 13:26.747
...from the syphilis.

13:27.182 --> 13:27.671
What?!

13:29.418 --> 13:32.251
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

13:33.251 --> 13:37.251
Your choice was that, syphilis?

13:37.251 --> 13:42.251
Hey, sweetie, at least they put you Tutsi show under prospective.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.585
Angela? Joey Tribiani.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.988
Listen, what are ya doing tonight?

13:51.264 --> 13:54.233
I know your seeing that guy, I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....

13:55.301 --> 13:56.893
Hello? Hello?

14:08.047 --> 14:11.539
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.918
- She wants to know what's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.555
You're married that's what's wrong.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.292
- Oh, my.
- What?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.225
She wants to meet you in person.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.292
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too,

14:26.499 --> 14:28.831
okay, but she's married, she has a husband.

14:29.102 --> 14:32.629
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.167
I mean you don't get chances like this all the time,

14:35.341 --> 14:37.707
if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself

14:37.844 --> 14:40.438
when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.

14:43.438 --> 14:45.438
I don't know.

14:45.438 --> 14:50.438
Listen, those bingbongs are the woman who loves you.

14:51.949 --> 14:53.814
Okay, I'll do it!

14:53.984 --> 14:55.611
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great!

14:55.786 --> 14:59.722
Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her!

14:59.957 --> 15:03.324
Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.257
No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.

15:06.497 --> 15:08.988
No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.

15:14.238 --> 15:17.537
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.300
Okay, last chance.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.010
Again, I'm sorry.

15:31.689 --> 15:35.056
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.

15:35.325 --> 15:38.761
You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society,

15:39.296 --> 15:40.456
and by that I mean my mom,

15:42.599 --> 15:43.789
has always convinced me that I...

15:49.239 --> 15:49.933
I do,

15:50.908 --> 15:53.903
I have to have children, I'm sorry. I just do.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.313
Yo! Can I have your attention, please,

15:58.849 --> 16:00.578
Best Man, making a toast here.

16:01.285 --> 16:01.944
Thank you.

16:03.787 --> 16:06.779
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...

16:10.360 --> 16:10.792
What?!

16:11.361 --> 16:13.761
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.

16:15.032 --> 16:16.863
Thank you, thank you very much.

16:17.835 --> 16:21.362
Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

16:22.539 --> 16:23.563
And Rachel...

16:24.408 --> 16:26.876
- What.
- No, no, no now in all seriousness,

16:27.478 --> 16:30.106
its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight,

16:30.581 --> 16:33.277
and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

16:41.492 --> 16:43.653
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...

16:43.827 --> 16:45.089
- Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?

16:47.264 --> 16:51.200
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

16:51.368 --> 16:52.198
Oh dear God.

16:53.704 --> 16:54.466
Ross,

16:55.005 --> 17:01.069
uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.242
And, uh, for the record

17:04.882 --> 17:08.249
she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

17:11.221 --> 17:12.654
What are you doing I'm serious.

17:14.625 --> 17:20.791
Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him,

17:21.832 --> 17:24.300
which incidentally worked out pretty well for me

17:37.300 --> 17:47.300
Rachel, took a lot of courage, doesn't has the syphilis and wild with me.

17:49.276 --> 17:49.799
Cheers!

17:51.711 --> 17:53.508
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach!

17:57.117 --> 17:59.711
And once again she is out of here.

17:59.886 --> 18:01.820
Okay who had 9:45? Um?

18:15.735 --> 18:18.397
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

18:18.872 --> 18:21.500
I probably should, but I'm not,

18:22.142 --> 18:26.306
see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.717
See now, tonight, all I really wanted was

18:32.886 --> 18:38.222
to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.

18:39.226 --> 18:42.718
Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

18:46.366 --> 18:51.633
There's nothing really left to say except....

18:57.944 --> 19:03.712
"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.

19:06.019 --> 19:13.016
With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there.

19:13.593 --> 19:15.117
She would..."

19:15.295 --> 19:17.388
- Marenge,
- "...marenge, thank you honey,

19:17.998 --> 19:20.330
and do the cha-cha.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.533
And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar.

19:25.739 --> 19:27.798
At the, wait, wait, everybody.."

19:50.931 --> 19:53.422
Okay, I'll do it.

19:54.834 --> 19:55.596
You'll do what?

19:55.869 --> 19:58.667
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.

20:00.006 --> 20:00.904
Oh my God!

20:01.708 --> 20:03.869
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again,

20:04.210 --> 20:06.178
I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing,

20:06.646 --> 20:08.273
I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings,

20:08.782 --> 20:10.215
I'll coach the soccer team.

20:11.618 --> 20:13.381
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

20:15.288 --> 20:15.982
Monica,

20:19.225 --> 20:20.419
I don't wanna lose you,

20:21.728 --> 20:25.824
so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.

20:29.602 --> 20:31.934
You're the most wonderful man.

20:34.441 --> 20:40.311
And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times,

20:41.348 --> 20:43.009
then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'

20:46.119 --> 20:46.915
But you're not.

20:50.190 --> 20:50.986
Oh my God,

20:53.226 --> 20:54.989
I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

20:58.965 --> 21:00.523
I wanna have a baby,

21:04.204 --> 21:07.799
but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

21:11.077 --> 21:11.907
God.

21:18.051 --> 21:18.983
I love you.

21:24.424 --> 21:25.482
I know you do.

21:29.029 --> 21:29.723
Me too.

21:37.537 --> 21:38.469
So what now?

21:41.107 --> 21:42.267
I guess we just

21:44.044 --> 21:45.068
keep dancing.

22:00.427 --> 22:01.917
Where is she, Where is she?

22:02.529 --> 22:05.020
Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?

22:05.432 --> 22:08.128
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.

22:12.138 --> 22:12.695
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.

22:13.273 --> 22:15.503
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

22:17.077 --> 22:20.410
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot,

22:20.814 --> 22:23.874
you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil.

22:25.151 --> 22:28.052
I think what you have to do is try not to...

22:33.927 --> 22:35.326
Oh my God!

22:38.431 --> 22:42.834
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!

22:52.612 --> 22:56.480
OH.....MY.....GOD!!

23:04.991 --> 23:08.518
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this,

23:08.695 --> 23:13.223
because I wanna be a good friend,  and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.

23:20.206 --> 23:21.400
Wow, you are a good friend,

23:22.375 --> 23:24.570
'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

23:27.046 --> 23:28.513
But that was a hell of a kiss.

23:29.282 --> 23:30.840
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
