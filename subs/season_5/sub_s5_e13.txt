WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:07.264
I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

00:07.474 --> 00:09.965
It's so good for Monica.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.644
Time's up! My turn.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.216
-That was half an hour?
-It's your timer.

00:22.555 --> 00:27.117
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.193
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

00:35.402 --> 00:36.835
It's so good, isn't it?

00:37.070 --> 00:39.300
I don't know what
I did to deserve it.

00:41.007 --> 00:45.068
Now stop trying to add more time
to your massage.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.507
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

00:48.815 --> 00:50.715
Goodbye, muscles!

00:52.152 --> 00:54.382
The One with Joey's Bag

01:39.666 --> 01:42.157
She gives the worst massages ever!

01:43.436 --> 01:46.667
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

01:47.207 --> 01:50.540
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

01:51.644 --> 01:54.340
If it hurts that bad,
you should tell her.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.343
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.780
I won't screw that up
by telling the truth.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.389
Dude, look out!

02:04.657 --> 02:06.284
You almost crushed my hat.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.152
Sorry.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.053
And the bunny got away.

02:19.272 --> 02:22.639
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.142
This is called a top hat.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.979
And why are you wearing this?
Is it "top hat"?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.216
There's this play...

02:41.494 --> 02:45.396
...and I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.496
A clotheshorse. So I figure...

02:47.734 --> 02:52.262
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.268
And you'll make them disappear?

02:55.542 --> 02:58.739
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.607
Done!

03:02.882 --> 03:07.114
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.785
-Thanks!
-Sure.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.578
Please, take those off!

03:14.027 --> 03:16.052
Hey, Phoebe. How's it going?

03:16.696 --> 03:20.097
Only okay because I just
got back from the hospital.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.133
Are you all right?

03:22.368 --> 03:25.360
I'm fine,
but my grandma sort of died.

03:26.906 --> 03:27.895
Phoebe, sorry.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.063
It's okay.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.277
She had a really incredible life.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.536
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.778
Maybe she's with us right now.

03:40.053 --> 03:44.922
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

03:45.158 --> 03:48.616
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

03:51.564 --> 03:54.055
Phoebe' grandmother just died.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.565
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

03:58.004 --> 04:01.098
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

04:01.441 --> 04:04.171
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.176
Not the way they're doing it.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.745
What happened?
How did she die?

04:12.986 --> 04:14.112
We were in the market...

04:14.354 --> 04:18.984
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.591
I'm so sorry.

04:21.794 --> 04:23.694
The last thing she said was:

04:23.930 --> 04:28.867
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

04:29.469 --> 04:30.527
You know what?

04:30.970 --> 04:33.370
We will meet at the checkout counter.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.982
Since you're returning
all this stuff...

04:44.217 --> 04:46.310
...you'll have to wear underwear.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.285
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.052
It's missing something.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.463
Really? A purse?

05:03.670 --> 05:06.537
It's not a purse.
It's a shoulder bag.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.231
It looks like a woman's purse.

05:09.976 --> 05:14.037
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.976
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.512
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.

05:27.894 --> 05:33.025
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.525
Exactly. Unisex!

05:36.836 --> 05:39.896
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

05:41.441 --> 05:45.036
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.079
I ain't gonna say no to that!

05:57.724 --> 05:59.351
-Who is it?
-It's Phoebe.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.024
Oh, great!

06:01.894 --> 06:03.691
Oh, you.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.692
What's up?

06:07.700 --> 06:11.261
Well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

06:12.739 --> 06:13.763
No, thanks.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.208
Grandma died today.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.808
Didn't she die like five years ago?

06:25.118 --> 06:27.484
No, she just died today.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.154
We're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.121
Okay, I know I went to that already.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.827
No, you didn't!

06:36.129 --> 06:37.619
Then who's been dead?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.057
Lots of people!

06:41.634 --> 06:43.659
Look, are you coming or not?

06:47.573 --> 06:50.736
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.175
Plus I'm going to a concert.

06:54.447 --> 06:57.939
I'd invite you,
but I only have two tickets left.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.954
-Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
-Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

07:15.768 --> 07:18.601
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.839
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

07:24.477 --> 07:27.776
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

07:28.214 --> 07:32.173
It's got compartments for your
wallet, keys, address book....

07:32.351 --> 07:33.340
Your makeup.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.213
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.016
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.458
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

07:44.697 --> 07:47.495
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

07:47.733 --> 07:51.032
-All right, then you owe me $350.
-Fine.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.529
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

07:56.843 --> 08:01.974
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.877
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

08:05.351 --> 08:07.717
Don't listen to them.
I think it's sexy.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.251
You-and-I sexy?

08:17.363 --> 08:20.389
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.657
Here's your 3-D glasses.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.999
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.008
Hi, sweetie.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.203
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.015
Hey, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.253
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

08:44.190 --> 08:45.384
I brought you flowers.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.115
Oh, thanks!

08:47.393 --> 08:50.294
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.629
Excuse me, is this the memorial?

08:55.902 --> 08:57.392
Welcome.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.270
Here's your 3-D glasses.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.205
All right.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.203
So how did you know Frances?

09:05.411 --> 09:07.971
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.978
But I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.412
What's your name?

09:14.654 --> 09:16.315
Frank Buffay.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.720
You know what? Strike that.
My name, actually, is Joe.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.620
Joe Hill.

09:25.798 --> 09:26.787
You're Frank Buf

09:27.099 --> 09:29.397
No! Joe Hill.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.725
You just said

09:31.971 --> 09:34.769
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.108
Oh, my God!

09:40.346 --> 09:41.472
What happened?

09:41.914 --> 09:43.074
That was my dad.

09:44.784 --> 09:45.910
Check it out!

09:46.919 --> 09:48.910
It's like it's coming right at me.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.595
-Did you catch him?
-What did he say?

10:00.833 --> 10:04.030
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

10:05.304 --> 10:07.431
I couldn't give him my real name.

10:07.673 --> 10:08.765
Why not?

10:09.041 --> 10:10.474
You saw the way he ran.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.474
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

10:13.713 --> 10:15.442
What did you say to him?

10:15.681 --> 10:19.879
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.985
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.884
Could everyone take their seats?

10:25.324 --> 10:27.815
I just can't think about that now.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.492
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.559
Let's go say goodbye.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.245
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.209
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.077
And a date with a man.

10:56.055 --> 11:00.151
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.055
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

11:03.362 --> 11:07.423
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.835
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

11:11.570 --> 11:13.333
...comes with a bag!

11:15.207 --> 11:17.198
I've got to meet my dad.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.204
Will you tell him who you are?

11:19.445 --> 11:22.039
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.182
But aren't you pissed at him?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.385
This guy abandoned you.

11:26.585 --> 11:30.885
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

11:31.123 --> 11:35.856
I'd walk in there,
I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!

11:36.095 --> 11:39.292
You and me, outside.
Right now!"

11:40.399 --> 11:42.094
I kind of scared myself.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.362
Well, at least you scared someone.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.207
You'd think I'd be angry.

11:49.408 --> 11:53.538
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny, little head off!

11:54.313 --> 11:56.645
Fortunately, I'm past it.

11:57.116 --> 12:00.813
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.142
Get off!

12:03.322 --> 12:06.314
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

12:07.126 --> 12:08.320
What are you talking about?

12:08.594 --> 12:11.392
As a masseuse and a human...

12:11.731 --> 12:15.064
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone!

12:16.102 --> 12:17.729
I give good massages.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.101
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

12:25.811 --> 12:28.507
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.648
He does not like it.
He's in pain!

12:32.918 --> 12:35.614
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is!

12:36.088 --> 12:39.580
-What?
-I'm sorry, but

12:44.130 --> 12:45.427
You've been lying to me?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.357
I can't believe that.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.624
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

12:49.869 --> 12:53.134
But the minute we start
to lie to each other....

12:56.509 --> 12:57.498
And by "we"...

12:58.177 --> 12:59.872
...I mean society.

13:02.681 --> 13:05.013
Anytime you're ready.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.777
Well, you must be new here.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.318
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.818
Could you try it without the purse?

13:14.894 --> 13:16.521
Yeah, sure.

13:20.332 --> 13:24.132
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit

13:24.637 --> 13:26.161
Can I ask you something?

13:26.372 --> 13:27.361
Sure. What?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.165
Well, first,
it's not a purse.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.235
Anytime.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.912
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.082
It's a man's bag.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.544
Okay. And go!

13:42.688 --> 13:45.248
Let me show you the catalog.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.017
Look. See?

13:48.594 --> 13:50.027
It's the latest thing.

13:50.262 --> 13:53.095
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.696
Do you sell these?

13:57.369 --> 14:00.065
No, these babies sell themselves.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.006
Thank you.
That was great.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.033
But I didn't read anything.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.404
I think we've seen enough.

14:09.248 --> 14:10.738
All right, I'll see you.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.779
We got it. We got it.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.411
Is Rachel here?

14:17.957 --> 14:22.724
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.453
I really like them.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.223
Please, stop!

14:29.568 --> 14:31.468
We're supposed to be honest.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.398
I wish you could tell me,
"l don't like your massages."

14:40.112 --> 14:42.603
I don't like your massages.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.151
See? It's no big deal.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.151
But now you're crying!

14:50.389 --> 14:54.553
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

14:55.761 --> 14:58.889
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.133
You don't have
to be best at everything.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.997
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

15:09.308 --> 15:11.776
You give the worst massages
in the world.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.068
I'm crying here!

15:14.780 --> 15:15.974
Look, hear me out.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.514
You give the best bad-massages.

15:20.452 --> 15:23.478
If anybody was looking
for the best bad-massage...

15:23.756 --> 15:26.020
...and they thought,
"Who's the best?"

15:26.258 --> 15:27.691
They'd have to go to you.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.097
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

15:37.336 --> 15:41.864
...for the best bad-massage....
Who would get that?

15:42.141 --> 15:43.768
It would be you!

15:44.009 --> 15:47.137
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.714
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.146
Absolutely.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.956
I suck!

16:05.864 --> 16:07.491
Thank you for meeting me.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.132
Thank you.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.235
Come sit.

16:13.505 --> 16:14.802
Sit.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.674
Sit!

16:18.644 --> 16:21.545
Alrighty.
Before we get started, I need you...

16:21.747 --> 16:25.911
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.153
Yes, I am.

16:31.256 --> 16:32.848
What did Frances leave me?

16:34.059 --> 16:35.856
That's why you wanted me to come.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.429
Yes, she did. She left you...

16:42.001 --> 16:43.832
...this lipstick.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.873
It's used.

16:53.245 --> 16:54.610
Cool!

16:57.383 --> 17:02.446
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.892
So question one:

17:08.594 --> 17:12.428
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

17:12.631 --> 17:14.622
Yes, I was.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.229
Question two.
Did that marriage end:

17:18.470 --> 17:20.062
A: Happily?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.602
B: Medium?

17:22.908 --> 17:26.036
Or C: In the total abandonment...

17:26.278 --> 17:28.303
...of her and her two children?

17:29.214 --> 17:30.408
It really says that?

17:30.649 --> 17:31.741
Yeah, see?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.152
I guess then I would have to say C.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.451
Total abandonment.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.654
Reasons for abandonment:

17:43.062 --> 17:46.293
A: Top-secret government work.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.991
B: Amnesia.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.566
Or C: You're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

17:51.804 --> 17:54.238
...bad, bad man.

17:54.773 --> 17:57.173
I don't want the lipstick that much.

17:58.944 --> 18:02.243
Would you do me a favor?

18:02.481 --> 18:04.176
Would you give Lilly...

18:05.150 --> 18:06.310
...that, please?

18:07.286 --> 18:09.516
When you see Lilly,
give her that note.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.155
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

18:12.658 --> 18:17.425
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.631
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

18:20.866 --> 18:23.494
But you came to see Lilly?

18:24.536 --> 18:25.594
Yeah. Why?

18:26.672 --> 18:28.469
Lilly's dead.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.134
She what?

18:31.543 --> 18:32.532
She's dead.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.167
Are you sure?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.540
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.815
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe

18:42.121 --> 18:44.817
How?
Oh, my God.

18:45.657 --> 18:46.646
How long ago?

18:46.992 --> 18:48.459
17 years ago.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.230
What about the girls?

18:56.168 --> 19:00.036
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.704
And Phoebe...

19:05.477 --> 19:07.308
...is on this couch.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.686
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!

19:19.992 --> 19:22.927
Phoebe, l....

19:25.397 --> 19:28.560
It's just, I don't know what to say.

19:29.935 --> 19:34.702
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.736
Yes, well, that's neither
here nor there.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.844
Would it make you feel
better if I said...

19:44.082 --> 19:47.711
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

19:50.088 --> 19:53.251
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.015
So you can just go.

19:56.795 --> 20:01.755
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.726
-That's your defense?
-Yes, it is.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.963
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

20:09.241 --> 20:13.803
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.873
You make up songs?

20:16.114 --> 20:19.242
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.284
Let's see, how did it go?

20:23.655 --> 20:26.647
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

20:27.292 --> 20:30.090
Why won't you go to sleep?

20:30.729 --> 20:33.391
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

20:33.665 --> 20:35.792
You're keeping me up

20:54.820 --> 20:56.788
I'm not very good at this.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.323
Well, I am.

21:06.999 --> 21:07.988
Not yet. No.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.165
How'd the audition go?

21:15.540 --> 21:16.973
Estelle said I didn't get it.

21:17.242 --> 21:20.473
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

21:20.712 --> 21:22.043
I thought so too...

21:22.314 --> 21:24.908
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

21:25.183 --> 21:26.377
What kind of problem?

21:26.718 --> 21:29.243
To tell you the truth...

21:29.521 --> 21:31.751
...they had a problem with the bag!

21:33.258 --> 21:35.852
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.525
It's time to give up the bag.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.363
I don't want to give up the bag.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.324
I don't have to give it up.
Do l, Rach?

21:47.739 --> 21:50.173
You think I should give up the bag!

21:50.509 --> 21:54.878
Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific
as I think you are with it...

21:57.015 --> 22:01.782
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.848
I can't believe this!

22:06.091 --> 22:09.288
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

22:10.562 --> 22:14.726
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

22:15.467 --> 22:16.957
...controversial.

22:18.036 --> 22:20.698
Yeah, they're called wallets.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.237
You're right. You're right.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.810
This bag has become like a part of me.

22:27.979 --> 22:31.039
It's like...my bag.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.481
It had a place for everything.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.419
-Oh, man.
-What?

22:37.589 --> 22:42.720
There's a whole series of pockets here
I didn't even know about, Rach. Look.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.459
Ursula, I have the most amazing news.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.795
I found our dad.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.460
Phoebe.

22:56.441 --> 23:00.673
Your sister.
And I found our dad.

23:00.879 --> 23:04.110
John Glenn? John Glenn is not our dad.

23:04.516 --> 23:08.418
No, I will not join you in the lawsuit
against him.

23:10.956 --> 23:13.117
It doesn't matter that he wasn't there
while we were growing up.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.418
He's not our father.

23:16.361 --> 23:18.829
What do you mean
that's for a jury to decide?
