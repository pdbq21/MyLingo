WEBVTT

00:01.813 --> 00:05.647
Do you reaIize this is the Iast time
we'II be here...

00:05.817 --> 00:07.444
...as si<i>x</i> singIe peopIe?

00:07.619 --> 00:10.588
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

00:14.192 --> 00:17.821
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

00:18.030 --> 00:21.557
The IittIe woman. The wife.
The oId baII and chain.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.067
-OId?
-The young, hot baII and chain.

00:25.337 --> 00:27.805
-Much better.
-We gotta go.

00:27.973 --> 00:32.000
-Where?
-Get the dress and Iunch with Mom.

00:32.177 --> 00:34.042
Joey, you too?

00:34.246 --> 00:36.441
I just heard ''Iunch.''

00:36.949 --> 00:38.940
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

00:41.486 --> 00:45.547
ActuaIIy, I'm gIad they're Ieaving.

00:45.824 --> 00:48.349
I need to taIk to you
about something.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.695
-What's up?
-This may be a IittIe awkward.

00:51.897 --> 00:56.732
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying 1 28 dinners tomorrow.

00:57.269 --> 00:59.203
No, it's not that.

01:00.205 --> 01:03.436
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

01:03.609 --> 01:06.134
...but as Monica's oIder brother.

01:06.311 --> 01:09.838
-But you're stiII my friend?
-Not for a few minutes.

01:10.015 --> 01:14.918
-Right now, are you stiII my best man?
-No.

01:16.088 --> 01:18.147
Do I stiII caII you Ross?

01:20.292 --> 01:25.491
You guys are getting married,
and I couIdn't be more thriIIed.

01:26.131 --> 01:29.464
But as her oIder brother,
I have to teII you this:

01:31.503 --> 01:34.870
If you ever hurt my IittIe sister...

01:35.440 --> 01:40.742
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

01:41.113 --> 01:43.172
...I wiII hunt you down...

01:44.116 --> 01:46.107
...and kick your ass.

01:52.824 --> 01:55.486
What? I'm serious.

01:57.462 --> 02:02.490
-Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
-I hear what you're saying...

02:03.335 --> 02:05.428
...and thanks for the warning.

02:05.604 --> 02:06.969
No probIem.

02:07.673 --> 02:10.198
Are we friends again?

02:10.475 --> 02:11.772
Yeah.

02:12.511 --> 02:16.345
You won't beIieve what Monica's
brother just said to me!

02:17.549 --> 02:19.779
The One With Monica and ChandIer's
Wedding

02:55.020 --> 02:56.487
What you doing, Mon?

02:56.655 --> 03:00.648
I'm Iisting things that
couId go wrong at the wedding.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.155
So I can be prepared.

03:04.329 --> 03:08.823
-What are they?
-So far, the dresses won't get picked up...

03:09.000 --> 03:12.458
...my veiI gets Iost
or I don't have something bIue.

03:12.637 --> 03:14.730
I'm responsibIe for aII those.

03:16.274 --> 03:18.105
I had to go with the odds.

03:19.344 --> 03:23.405
Remember that audition I had a whiIe ago
and I didn't get the part?

03:23.582 --> 03:25.516
-The commerciaI?
-That pIay?

03:25.684 --> 03:27.549
That other pIay?

03:27.719 --> 03:29.550
-The movie?
-Yes!

03:29.721 --> 03:32.121
The one about the dog
who fIies pIanes?

03:32.290 --> 03:35.316
No. But, man, that one hurt.

03:35.527 --> 03:39.725
-This is the one about WWI soIdiers.
-Oh, yeah.

03:39.965 --> 03:42.729
Back then we caIIed it
''The Great War.''

03:44.302 --> 03:45.963
It reaIIy was.

03:47.305 --> 03:51.173
The guy they wanted backed out!
I start shooting today!

03:51.343 --> 03:52.469
CongratuIations!

03:52.644 --> 03:56.205
-Today's the rehearsaI dinner.
-I'II be done by then.

03:56.381 --> 03:59.214
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

03:59.384 --> 04:02.046
See you. I'm off
to fight the Nazis.

04:02.220 --> 04:06.714
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWII, not WWI.

04:09.261 --> 04:11.092
Who was in WWI?

04:14.199 --> 04:15.564
Go ahead.

04:16.034 --> 04:18.696
You're gonna be Iate!
Go! Go!

04:20.972 --> 04:23.497
Who did we fight in WWI?

04:24.042 --> 04:26.374
-Me<i>x</i>ico?
-Yes. Very good.

04:42.227 --> 04:45.162
-Hey, Joey. We're ready.
-Yeah, me too.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.423
Richard, we're ready for you.

04:47.599 --> 04:51.729
Joey Tribbiani, this is Richard Crosby.
He's pIaying Vincent.

04:52.504 --> 04:55.371
-I'm acting with you?
-Nice to meet you.

04:55.540 --> 04:59.738
I can't beIieve this. This is incredibIe.
You just won an Oscar.

05:00.378 --> 05:02.073
No, I didn't.

05:02.814 --> 05:04.441
I think you did.

05:05.617 --> 05:08.586
I think I Iost, three times.

05:10.689 --> 05:13.055
-Cookie? WouId you...?
-No.

05:13.225 --> 05:17.286
We're about an hour away
from getting the scene Iit.

05:17.462 --> 05:21.762
-Can you guys run it a coupIe times?
-Yeah, sure.

05:21.933 --> 05:23.764
AII right. Let's do it.

05:25.036 --> 05:27.527
And.... Action!

05:27.839 --> 05:31.866
-We have to find the pIatoon!
-Forget it, the pIatoon is gone!

05:35.280 --> 05:39.216
-What?
-The pIatoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

05:41.019 --> 05:44.113
What'II we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

05:44.289 --> 05:48.055
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

05:49.427 --> 05:52.692
Hang on.
Joey, you keep touching your face.

05:52.864 --> 05:53.956
Something wrong?

05:55.066 --> 05:56.727
No. No.

05:58.403 --> 06:01.395
I thought it might be
a cooI character thing.

06:01.573 --> 06:04.440
He's a face toucher.

06:08.179 --> 06:09.612
I don't think so.

06:11.116 --> 06:15.075
Let's take it back
to Richard's Iast Iines. Action!

06:15.887 --> 06:18.788
We may not have weapons,
but we stiII have food.

06:18.957 --> 06:20.447
Potatoes, pasta...

06:20.625 --> 06:22.593
...and a few tins of tuna!

06:25.297 --> 06:27.424
Honey, we gotta go!

06:27.699 --> 06:30.429
Here's a <i>q</i>uestion
you never want to ask:

06:30.602 --> 06:34.595
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearI neckIaces?

06:35.807 --> 06:38.970
Did he say what kind of neckIine
he's wearing?

06:39.144 --> 06:40.236
No.

06:40.812 --> 06:43.303
I just met him once,
but I'm guessing...

06:43.481 --> 06:44.470
...pIunging?

06:44.649 --> 06:49.348
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
fIaunt-it kind of father.

06:50.455 --> 06:52.889
Let me see if RacheI has anything.

06:53.058 --> 06:55.026
Yes, incIude more peopIe in this.

06:57.028 --> 07:01.089
Do you reaIize that at this time tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

07:01.266 --> 07:03.257
I have a date tomorrow night.

07:04.636 --> 07:08.936
-I can't beIieve we made it.
-Don't sound so surprised.

07:09.107 --> 07:10.574
I'm sorry, but....

07:11.643 --> 07:14.134
-Nothing.
-What?

07:15.380 --> 07:18.474
WeII, honestIy?
Ever since we got engaged...

07:18.650 --> 07:21.642
...I've been waiting for something
to fIip you out.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.549
HonestIy? Me too.

07:25.156 --> 07:26.646
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

07:26.825 --> 07:30.727
I think that something
wiII come up and I'II go aII....

07:30.895 --> 07:32.419
WeII, ChandIer.

07:33.131 --> 07:35.759
-But nothing has.
-I'm so gIad.

07:35.934 --> 07:38.698
Thank you for staying
so caIm during this.

07:38.870 --> 07:41.100
It's made me stay caIm.

07:42.407 --> 07:44.398
I couId've been worse.

07:45.076 --> 07:46.600
I'II be right there.

07:53.485 --> 07:56.977
<i>If you're calling before Saturday,</i>
<i>you've reached Monica and Chandler.</i>

07:57.155 --> 08:02.354
<i>But if you're calling after Saturday,</i>
<i>you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing.</i>

08:02.527 --> 08:05.462
<i>Please leave a message for...the Bings!</i>

08:22.447 --> 08:24.506
Hey, Maureen! Hi!

08:24.682 --> 08:28.812
-This is my cousin, Maureen.
-We're the Bings.

08:32.023 --> 08:34.753
Hi! You guys Iook so beautifuI.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.655
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!

08:39.931 --> 08:41.762
Monica.

08:41.933 --> 08:45.835
So you know, I had my
''oIder brother'' taIk with ChandIer.

08:46.004 --> 08:47.369
What is that?

08:47.539 --> 08:50.770
I toId him that if he ever hurt you...

08:50.942 --> 08:54.776
...I wouId hunt him down
and kick his ass.

08:57.816 --> 09:01.081
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

09:01.252 --> 09:02.742
I wouId kick his ass!

09:05.390 --> 09:07.551
Ross, pIease, my makeup!

09:10.862 --> 09:12.955
-ChandIer.
-Mom.

09:13.131 --> 09:15.929
Thanks for wearing...something.

09:18.036 --> 09:23.064
This is so e<i>x</i>citing! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

09:24.476 --> 09:29.209
Just think, soon there wiII be
Iots of IittIe Bings.

09:34.018 --> 09:37.510
I can't beIieve I'm going back to work
to get spit on again.

09:37.722 --> 09:41.590
You're Iucky. At Ieast the peopIe
that spit on you are famous.

09:42.694 --> 09:46.255
-Who spits on you?
-I don't want to taIk about work.

09:47.765 --> 09:51.792
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack GeIIer.

09:51.970 --> 09:55.929
-It's IoveIy to meet you.
-Are you his mother or father?

09:56.107 --> 09:57.734
Jack!

09:58.810 --> 10:01.335
What? I've never seen one before.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.879
Dad, there's Ross.
Go taIk to him.

10:04.048 --> 10:07.381
I wasn't even abIe to act
Iike I'm okay with it.

10:10.588 --> 10:12.613
HeIIo, aII.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.790
Hi...Dad.

10:17.629 --> 10:19.494
Hi, Mr. Bing.

10:21.032 --> 10:24.092
-Nora.
-CharIes.

10:25.770 --> 10:29.001
-It's so great to see you both here.
-Yes.

10:29.174 --> 10:32.769
AIthough we may be seeing
too much of some peopIe.

10:35.446 --> 10:38.779
Aren't you a IittIe oId
to wear a dress Iike that?

10:38.950 --> 10:43.114
Don't you have a IittIe too much penis
to wear a dress Iike that?

10:44.789 --> 10:46.586
Oh, my God.

10:49.194 --> 10:51.958
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

10:52.130 --> 10:55.566
You couId kick anyone's ass
you want to.

10:56.768 --> 10:59.134
Thanks, you guys.

11:02.707 --> 11:04.038
-Rach, Rach?
-Yeah?

11:04.209 --> 11:08.145
TaIk to ChandIer's dad and
keep him away from ChandIer's mom.

11:08.313 --> 11:12.682
-But I don't know what he Iooks Iike.
-He's the man in the bIack dress.

11:20.425 --> 11:23.861
Hi! I'm RacheI,
a friend of Monica and ChandIer's.

11:24.028 --> 11:27.191
-I'm Amanda.
-Oh, I get it.

11:27.365 --> 11:30.630
''A man, duh!''

11:35.506 --> 11:37.406
CouId I have your attention?

11:38.443 --> 11:42.743
-I'm Ross GeIIer.
-Dr. Ross GeIIer.

11:44.182 --> 11:47.743
Dad, pIease. As I was saying...

11:47.919 --> 11:50.649
...I'm Dr. Ross GeIIer.

11:52.223 --> 11:54.054
And I'm the best man.

11:54.225 --> 11:59.026
And I have to say, I'm a IittIe surprised
we're aII here today.

11:59.197 --> 12:02.633
For those of you
who don't know ChandIer...

12:02.800 --> 12:05.894
...he's not the biggest fan
of reIationships.

12:06.604 --> 12:09.937
In fact, I think before he met Monica...

12:10.108 --> 12:14.511
...the onIy reaI reIationship he had was
with a girI named MoIIy.

12:14.679 --> 12:19.139
And he wouId've married her,
onIy she couIdn't controI her bIadder.

12:23.621 --> 12:26.886
It was his dog.
Did I say it was his dog?

12:27.492 --> 12:29.585
Any-- Anyway....

12:30.595 --> 12:35.555
This marriage is doubIy speciaI for me...

12:35.733 --> 12:39.829
...because not onIy is the groom
my best friend...

12:40.004 --> 12:44.668
...but the bride is my IittIe sister.

12:45.943 --> 12:49.606
She's the greatest sister
a guy couId ask for.

12:50.648 --> 12:53.378
PIease join me in raising a gIass...

12:53.551 --> 12:57.544
...to the coupIe we're
here to ceIebrate.

12:57.922 --> 13:00.618
-To the Bings.
-To the Bings!

13:10.501 --> 13:15.803
How cooI is it that the ne<i>x</i>t time you see
ChandIer you'II be waIking down the aisIe?

13:16.007 --> 13:19.773
I can't beIieve that after tomorrow
it's aII gonna be over.

13:19.944 --> 13:24.779
Honey, it's not gonna be over.
You're gonna be married to ChandIer.

13:26.184 --> 13:28.652
Maybe I can wear the dress for HaIIoween!

13:30.421 --> 13:32.446
I'm gonna steam my dress.

13:32.623 --> 13:35.285
Who wiII make sure nothing
happens to it?

13:35.460 --> 13:38.190
-I'II do it.
-Who wants it? Anybody?

13:39.030 --> 13:40.930
-I said, I'II do it.
-Nobody?

13:41.099 --> 13:45.468
-AII right, I'II do it myseIf.
-I'm not gonna screw it up.

13:46.003 --> 13:49.404
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big heIp tonight.

13:49.574 --> 13:53.169
Thanks for heIping my grandmother
get to the hoteI safeIy.

13:53.344 --> 13:57.508
-Of course! That's what I'm here for.
-Okay. Sorry.

13:59.617 --> 14:01.016
What grandmother?

14:05.156 --> 14:08.990
-Where have you been?
-Taking my parents to the hoteI.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.424
-Going back to work?
-Yeah.

14:11.596 --> 14:13.359
-Nice shades.
-Thanks.

14:13.531 --> 14:17.661
I figure if I wear these in my scenes,
I won't get spit in my eyes.

14:18.369 --> 14:23.671
And, if I remember correctIy,
Ray-Ban was the officiaI sponsor of WWI.

14:24.542 --> 14:27.443
Great! AII right!

14:27.879 --> 14:29.744
-I'II see you Iater.
-AII right.

14:29.914 --> 14:33.042
-Where's ChandIer?
-I think he's in RacheI's room.

14:34.419 --> 14:35.750
ChandIer?

14:59.844 --> 15:03.712
-Is Monica here?
-She's steaming her dress. Why?

15:04.782 --> 15:08.240
-I think ChandIer's gone.
-What?

15:08.419 --> 15:12.355
-He Ieft that.
-''TeII Monica I'm sorry.''

15:13.324 --> 15:14.951
Oh, my God.

15:15.626 --> 15:17.116
What's up?

15:19.330 --> 15:21.821
''TeII Monica I'm sorry.''

15:23.401 --> 15:25.232
TeII her yourseIf.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.401
Oh, my God.
ChandIer just Ieft, though?

15:34.579 --> 15:37.173
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

15:37.348 --> 15:41.375
''TeII Monica I'm sorry
I drank the Iast of the miIk.''

15:41.552 --> 15:45.989
Or ''TeII Monica I'm sorry
I used her tweezers to pIuck my nose hair.''

15:47.091 --> 15:48.752
He does that. I've seen him.

15:50.328 --> 15:56.563
Or maybe he was writing to teII her
that he's changed his name:

15:56.734 --> 15:59.828
''TeII Monica I'm Sorry.''

16:02.273 --> 16:07.609
-It means he freaked out and Ieft!
-Don't be so negative!

16:07.778 --> 16:13.182
Good God, isn't it possibIe that
''Sorry'' is sitting in there right now?

16:14.285 --> 16:18.415
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

16:18.589 --> 16:22.150
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.955
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

16:26.230 --> 16:29.393
But if you don't find him
and bring him back...

16:29.567 --> 16:32.968
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

16:35.606 --> 16:37.437
I wiII find him.

16:44.782 --> 16:46.773
WeII, the dress is done.

16:47.985 --> 16:49.350
What?

16:49.520 --> 16:52.421
We're just so happy for you.

16:52.757 --> 16:55.021
That's so sweet!

16:55.560 --> 16:59.894
Can we just take a minute and taIk about
the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.

17:00.064 --> 17:02.362
I mean, how Iucky am I?

17:03.100 --> 17:05.193
That's a good <i>q</i>uestion.

17:07.572 --> 17:10.769
I just hope that someday
you guys find someone Iike ChandIer.

17:10.942 --> 17:14.673
I hope we find someone e<i>x</i>actIy
Iike ChandIer and soon.

17:19.450 --> 17:23.011
Joey? Can you
go through these Iines with me?

17:23.187 --> 17:26.179
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

17:27.525 --> 17:30.790
-Just the Iast two pages.
-AII right.

17:35.066 --> 17:36.829
I found the picture!

17:38.269 --> 17:39.998
Picture? What picture?

17:40.171 --> 17:43.265
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.

17:43.841 --> 17:48.141
-CouId you Iower the script?
-I don't want to.

17:49.180 --> 17:53.412
I need to see your face
so I can pIay off your reaction.

17:54.318 --> 17:55.683
Okay, Iook.

17:55.853 --> 18:00.586
I know you're great
and pIay aII those Shakespeare guys...

18:00.758 --> 18:03.226
...but you're spitting
aII over me, man.

18:03.828 --> 18:07.320
-Of course I am!
-You know you've been spitting?

18:07.498 --> 18:09.591
That's what reaI actors do.

18:11.002 --> 18:14.165
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

18:14.338 --> 18:17.432
And when you enunciate, you spit!

18:19.810 --> 18:22.506
Didn't know that.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.114
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

18:26.651 --> 18:29.586
Picture? What picture?

18:38.396 --> 18:41.957
-Gunther, have you seen ChandIer?
-No, I haven't seen him.

18:42.133 --> 18:45.227
-Damn.
-He's getting married tomorrow, right?

18:45.403 --> 18:48.167
Yes. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

18:48.339 --> 18:52.105
-We'II see you tomorrow at the wedding.
-I wasn't invited.

18:53.744 --> 18:56.941
Then we'II see you
the day after tomorrow.

18:59.617 --> 19:01.346
Mom? Dad?

19:01.519 --> 19:03.714
What are you doing here?

19:03.888 --> 19:07.619
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is aII about.

19:07.792 --> 19:11.353
-I see why the girIs Iike coming here.
-Why?

19:11.529 --> 19:14.191
The se<i>x</i>y bIond behind the counter.

19:19.937 --> 19:23.805
-Gunther?
-She just added him to her Iist.

19:24.809 --> 19:28.677
-What? Your Iist?
-Of peopIe we're aIIowed to sIeep--

19:28.846 --> 19:31.474
I know what the Iist is.

19:31.649 --> 19:34.345
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.112
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.

19:38.322 --> 19:41.723
If you see ChandIer,
teII him I'm Iooking for him.

19:41.892 --> 19:46.329
And if you see Rita Moreno,
Iet her know I'm Iooking for her.

19:51.769 --> 19:53.168
Action!

19:56.640 --> 19:58.301
I found the picture!

19:59.110 --> 20:01.010
What picture?

20:02.146 --> 20:05.206
The picture of my wife, in your pack!

20:05.850 --> 20:08.683
You went through my personaI property?

20:09.954 --> 20:13.390
Why do you have a picture of PauIette
in your pack?

20:16.660 --> 20:19.993
Because, Vincent, we were Iovers...

20:21.232 --> 20:23.132
...for two years!

20:23.334 --> 20:26.030
Cut! WonderfuI!

20:28.839 --> 20:30.033
Great scene!

20:30.207 --> 20:34.473
You were awesome. In that
Iast speech, you soaked me.

20:34.645 --> 20:37.739
-Tomorrow's caII sheet.
-I'm not working tomorrow.

20:37.915 --> 20:41.316
-You are now.
-No, you gotta get me out of it.

20:41.485 --> 20:43.544
I have pIans. Important pIans!

20:52.029 --> 20:55.726
-Ross said stiII no word from ChandIer.
-Oh, man.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.392
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th Avenue.

21:00.905 --> 21:03.305
Okay, weII, there's one down.

21:04.308 --> 21:06.173
I'm getting married today!

21:10.080 --> 21:13.948
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

21:14.118 --> 21:16.484
My day is finaIIy here!

21:19.256 --> 21:22.191
She might not even notice he's gone.

21:23.561 --> 21:25.756
I'm gonna start getting ready!

21:27.565 --> 21:31.626
We can't Iet her start getting ready.
This is too awfuI!

21:31.802 --> 21:35.169
But she'II be in the gown
and then he won't show up...

21:35.339 --> 21:38.137
...then she'II have
to take off the gown--

21:38.309 --> 21:40.937
Stop it. You can't do this here.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.113
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:44.281 --> 21:46.841
It's just so sad.

21:47.017 --> 21:50.009
PuII it together.
She can't see you Iike this.

21:50.187 --> 21:54.283
-She'II know something's wrong.
-I know. I know. Oh, God!

21:54.458 --> 21:56.119
There's no tissue.

21:56.293 --> 21:58.591
Can you grab me some toiIet paper?

21:58.762 --> 22:02.823
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

22:03.634 --> 22:06.159
-I found one.
-Okay.

22:08.672 --> 22:10.503
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

22:10.674 --> 22:12.574
Oh, God.

22:15.379 --> 22:17.244
Can I have another one?

22:18.415 --> 22:19.677
Sure.

22:22.820 --> 22:24.754
Do you need some fIoss?

22:26.156 --> 22:30.024
I can't imagine what wiII happen
if he doesn't show up.

22:30.194 --> 22:31.957
Here's a whoIe bunch.

22:32.129 --> 22:34.529
She'II be at the wedding waiting...

22:34.698 --> 22:38.225
...and peopIe wiII be whispering,
''Oh, that poor girI.''

22:38.402 --> 22:41.735
Then she'II have to come back here
and Iive aIone.

22:41.906 --> 22:43.897
-Oh, my God.
-What?

22:44.074 --> 22:49.410
There was a pregnancy test in the
garbage. And it's positive.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.570
Monica's pregnant.

22:54.485 --> 22:57.147
So I guess she won't be totaIIy aIone.

23:02.059 --> 23:03.151
Oh, my God!

23:03.327 --> 23:06.694
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!

23:06.864 --> 23:09.765
Can this count as her ''something new''?

23:10.567 --> 23:11.932
Oh, my God.

23:15.673 --> 23:18.335
Do you think this is why
ChandIer took off?

23:18.509 --> 23:22.536
She had to have just taken that test.
I took out the trash Iast night.

23:22.713 --> 23:25.204
It's turning into
the worst wedding ever.

23:25.382 --> 23:30.012
The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing
and I'm stiII hoIding this.

23:30.921 --> 23:35.620
Phoebe, we cannot teII anyone
about this.

23:35.793 --> 23:38.091
-Right. Yeah.
-Okay?

23:38.262 --> 23:41.720
Hey, wait. Do you know
what kind of birth controI she uses?

23:41.899 --> 23:42.991
No. Why?

23:43.167 --> 23:47.001
Just for the future.
This is hardIy a commerciaI for it.

23:52.977 --> 23:53.966
Anything?

23:54.144 --> 23:57.545
No. I taIked to Joey on the set.
He hasn't heard from him.

23:57.715 --> 24:00.206
I taIked to ChandIer's parents again.

24:00.384 --> 24:01.681
You said he was missing?

24:01.852 --> 24:04.650
No. I made it seem Iike I caIIed to chat.

24:04.822 --> 24:08.189
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested in them.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.987
-We've got to teII her he's gone.
-No, we can't.

24:11.161 --> 24:13.391
She'II start getting ready soon.

24:13.564 --> 24:17.898
Can't you staII her? I'II go back
to the pIaces I went Iast night.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.330
How much time?

24:19.503 --> 24:22.336
How Iong before she absoIuteIy
has to start getting ready?

24:22.506 --> 24:24.030
-One hour.
-Give me two.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.335
Then why do you ask?

24:27.711 --> 24:30.305
-Wish me Iuck.
-I'm going with you.

24:30.848 --> 24:32.042
Why?

24:32.216 --> 24:36.846
You're tired. You Iooked aII night.
And, cIearIy, you suck at this.

24:37.021 --> 24:40.252
I have documented night bIindness.

24:41.225 --> 24:42.283
No, you don't!

24:42.459 --> 24:44.654
Okay. But I don't suck!

24:45.029 --> 24:46.121
See you Iater.

24:46.296 --> 24:48.491
Do you know how
you're gonna staII her?

24:48.665 --> 24:51.031
Because she is insane
about her scheduIe today.

24:51.201 --> 24:54.500
-I'II figure something out.
-Okay, good Iuck.

24:56.673 --> 25:00.370
I thought we'd start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

25:00.544 --> 25:04.446
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to taIk to me.

25:04.815 --> 25:06.407
About what?

25:08.752 --> 25:12.518
I'm never gonna get married!

25:12.689 --> 25:15.817
You wiII. The right guy's
just around the corner.

25:15.993 --> 25:18.086
Okay, are we done with that?

25:18.896 --> 25:20.659
No, I'm serious.

25:21.065 --> 25:26.093
Maybe I shouId just forget about it.
Become a Iesbian or something.

25:26.270 --> 25:28.534
Any woman wouId be Iucky to have you.

25:30.874 --> 25:33.741
Maybe I'd feeI better
if I sIept with Joey.

25:33.911 --> 25:35.902
RacheI? Are you okay?

25:40.584 --> 25:45.715
E<i>x</i>cuse me, Aaron? I have
a IittIe probIem with the scheduIe.

25:45.889 --> 25:50.792
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

25:50.961 --> 25:53.759
It's my best friend's
and I'm officiating...

25:53.931 --> 25:55.865
...so I reaIIy can't work past 4.

25:56.633 --> 26:01.502
You've gotta stay untiI the end.
We can't stop fiIming just for you.

26:01.672 --> 26:03.970
It's not Iike it's your wedding.

26:04.141 --> 26:06.302
It is my wedding.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.536
Did I not make that cIear?

26:08.946 --> 26:11.107
You said your best friend
is getting married.

26:11.281 --> 26:12.612
Yeah, to me.

26:12.783 --> 26:16.617
Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend.
Isn't that beautifuI?

26:17.454 --> 26:20.218
-But you said you were officiating.
-Yeah.

26:20.390 --> 26:24.019
-Your own wedding?
-Happens more than you think.

26:25.162 --> 26:27.824
I'm sorry, Joey. It's stiII no.

26:28.565 --> 26:30.533
I'm having surgery.

26:31.835 --> 26:33.029
What?

26:33.203 --> 26:37.697
I made up the stuff about the wedding
because I didn't want you to worry.

26:37.875 --> 26:39.706
But I'm having surgery today.

26:40.043 --> 26:41.533
What kind of surgery?

26:42.513 --> 26:44.504
TranspIant.

26:46.283 --> 26:48.877
But you're supposed to work on Monday.

26:49.052 --> 26:51.612
Hair transpIant.

26:51.922 --> 26:53.355
But you're not baId.

26:54.224 --> 26:56.454
It's not on my head.

27:00.030 --> 27:04.831
There's nothing I can do.
You'II probabIy be out by 4 anyway.

27:05.002 --> 27:09.564
We've just got one short scene,
it's just you and Richard and he's a pro.

27:09.740 --> 27:11.731
You'II be fine.

27:12.309 --> 27:13.776
Morning, Richard.

27:13.944 --> 27:17.004
Hey, you're here! Great!
Let's go, buddy!

27:17.181 --> 27:19.445
We got a scene to shoot!

27:20.417 --> 27:23.045
I'm wearing two beIts.

27:26.356 --> 27:28.586
-Are you drunk?
-No.

27:28.759 --> 27:29.783
Yes, you are!

27:30.794 --> 27:32.318
AII right.

27:36.667 --> 27:40.933
We are never gonna find him.
He's one guy in a huge city.

27:41.405 --> 27:43.635
Oh, my God. Is that him?

27:45.042 --> 27:48.443
That is an oId Chinese woman.

27:50.113 --> 27:52.377
He couId be in disguise, you know.

27:52.883 --> 27:55.909
You know what? You're right.
You're absoIuteIy right.

27:56.086 --> 27:57.951
Wait a minute.

27:58.855 --> 28:00.186
ChandIer!

28:02.059 --> 28:04.084
Now you're thinking.

28:04.261 --> 28:06.821
Maybe we're just approaching
this aII wrong.

28:06.997 --> 28:09.329
If you're ChandIer
and you want to hide...

28:09.499 --> 28:13.799
...where is the Iast pIace on Earth
peopIe wouId think you'd go?

28:13.971 --> 28:15.563
So this is your office.

28:17.140 --> 28:20.701
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I shouId've hid at the gym.

28:22.512 --> 28:25.003
-What the heII are you doing?
-Panicking.

28:25.649 --> 28:29.380
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm reIated to Monica.

28:32.222 --> 28:34.713
-How is she?
-She doesn't know you're gone.

28:34.891 --> 28:38.588
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

28:38.762 --> 28:41.162
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

28:41.331 --> 28:44.528
Because if I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.

28:44.901 --> 28:46.528
I can't be the Bings.

28:46.703 --> 28:48.193
What's wrong with it?

28:48.372 --> 28:50.363
The Bings have horribIe marriages.

28:50.540 --> 28:51.837
They yeII, they fight...

28:52.009 --> 28:55.968
...and they use the pooI boy
as a pawn in their se<i>x</i>uaI games.

28:56.913 --> 29:01.748
Have you ever put on a bIack dress
and asked me up to your hoteI room?

29:01.985 --> 29:05.352
-No.
-Then you are neither of your parents.

29:07.924 --> 29:12.361
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

29:12.529 --> 29:15.521
OnIy PauI Newman
can make marriage work.

29:15.699 --> 29:17.758
And I've met me.
I am no PauI Newman.

29:17.934 --> 29:22.871
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.930
But Iook, ChandIer...

29:25.742 --> 29:30.042
...right now no one has
a Iower opinion of you than I do.

29:31.848 --> 29:34.476
But I totaIIy beIieve you can do this.

29:35.018 --> 29:38.954
I want to. I Iove her so much,
but I'm afraid--

29:39.790 --> 29:41.018
This is too huge.

29:41.191 --> 29:43.216
You're right. It is huge.

29:43.393 --> 29:47.090
So why don't we take it
just a IittIe bit at a time.

29:47.264 --> 29:50.358
Forget getting married for a sec.
Just forget about it.

29:50.534 --> 29:54.300
Can you just come home
and take a shower?

29:55.205 --> 29:56.536
WeII, yeah. But then--

30:00.077 --> 30:03.012
We're just gonna go home
and take a shower.

30:03.180 --> 30:05.273
That's not scary, right?

30:05.649 --> 30:08.209
Depends on what you mean by ''we.''

30:09.186 --> 30:11.313
-AII right!
-There he is!

30:11.488 --> 30:14.855
Good oId ChandIer
with the homophobic jokes.

30:15.025 --> 30:16.424
So, what do you say?

30:17.027 --> 30:19.188
I'II shower,
but I won't promise anything.

30:19.363 --> 30:24.062
Okay, that's aII we're taIking about.
Okay? Come on, Iet's go home.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.365
Who's Mike Smith?

30:30.307 --> 30:32.901
I was sure this was my office.

30:35.045 --> 30:37.377
The nights are the hardest.

30:39.716 --> 30:41.911
But then the day comes...

30:42.085 --> 30:44.519
...and that's every bit as hard
as the night.

30:46.356 --> 30:50.122
-Then the night comes again--
-The days and nights are hard, I get it!

30:50.293 --> 30:54.059
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

30:54.931 --> 30:57.729
I know. At dusk.

30:57.901 --> 31:00.426
That's such a hard time for me.

31:01.037 --> 31:04.700
I'm gonna put my makeup on.
We have to be at the hoteI in an hour.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.342
-Wait!
-What?

31:06.510 --> 31:08.740
Let's go to Iunch!

31:09.045 --> 31:10.706
I can't go to Iunch!

31:11.381 --> 31:12.439
Right.

31:15.051 --> 31:17.611
Oh, good God, I've faIIen down.

31:20.090 --> 31:21.853
What's going on?

31:24.594 --> 31:26.289
AII right, honey, Iisten.

31:27.731 --> 31:32.259
When I teII you what I'm about to teII you,
I need you to remember...

31:32.436 --> 31:35.894
...that we are aII here for you
and that we Iove you.

31:36.072 --> 31:38.370
Okay, you're reaIIy freaking me out.

31:40.343 --> 31:42.641
We can't find ChandIer--

31:43.914 --> 31:45.506
--'s vest.

31:46.349 --> 31:48.442
We can't find ChandIer's vest.

31:48.618 --> 31:51.314
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?

31:53.123 --> 31:54.215
Found the vest.

31:54.391 --> 31:58.589
We'II have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't Iose it again.

31:59.596 --> 32:02.360
Okay, don't scare me Iike that, okay?

32:03.400 --> 32:07.962
For a minute, I was Iike,
''Oh, my God! The worst has happened!''

32:12.442 --> 32:15.843
I wouId sooner die in this heIIhoIe
than see her back with you!

32:16.012 --> 32:18.105
That can be arranged.

32:21.785 --> 32:24.447
-Let's reset.
-What?! He got me!

32:26.590 --> 32:28.649
Let's take it from there.

32:28.825 --> 32:33.262
Are you a IittIe off today?
It's going terribIy sIowIy.

32:34.598 --> 32:38.500
Look, my best friends are getting
married in, Iike, an hour, okay?

32:38.668 --> 32:41.933
And I'm the minister.
PIease, can you puII it together?

32:42.105 --> 32:47.372
Of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss
anything Iike that on account of me.

32:47.544 --> 32:50.138
-I can do this.
-Thank you. Thank you.

32:50.313 --> 32:52.543
StiII roIIing. And, action.

32:52.782 --> 32:55.842
I wouId sooner die in this heIIhoIe
than see her back with you!

32:56.019 --> 32:58.419
That can be arranged!

33:01.591 --> 33:03.149
SIippery IittIe bugger!

33:15.972 --> 33:17.906
So you two were married, huh?

33:20.243 --> 33:22.871
What happened, you just drift apart?

33:25.649 --> 33:27.776
Do you remember our wedding day?

33:27.984 --> 33:30.919
Did you know I sIept with the best man?

33:31.087 --> 33:32.520
Yes, he toId me.

33:32.789 --> 33:35.314
At Ieast I think that was what he said.

33:35.492 --> 33:40.088
It was difficuIt to understand
with his Iegs wrapped around my head.

33:44.834 --> 33:47.496
Here comes the bride.

33:49.973 --> 33:53.409
Oh, my God, Monica!

33:53.843 --> 33:56.403
I want to wear this every day.

33:56.646 --> 33:58.637
You Iook so beautifuI.

34:00.016 --> 34:01.745
I'm so happy for me.

34:05.855 --> 34:08.824
-HeIIo?
-Did ChandIer show up yet?

34:08.992 --> 34:12.519
-We got him back. Everything's fine.
-Damn it!

34:12.696 --> 34:15.460
-Where are you?
-I'm stiII on the set.

34:15.632 --> 34:18.601
The wedding is in Iess than an hour.

34:18.768 --> 34:23.603
I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't Iet me go untiI we get this.

34:23.773 --> 34:27.402
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

34:27.577 --> 34:30.171
No, I'm the minister!

34:30.447 --> 34:33.905
Look, put them both on the phone,
I'II marry them right now.

34:34.651 --> 34:36.209
Joey, I have to go.

34:36.386 --> 34:40.083
Don't hang up on me! I'II marry you
and me right now! I have the power!

34:44.294 --> 34:47.457
There you go! You put on a tu<i>x</i>edo!

34:48.131 --> 34:50.065
That wasn't scary, was it?

34:50.900 --> 34:52.060
No.

34:52.802 --> 34:55.896
I'm teIIing you,
just a IittIe bit at a time.

34:56.406 --> 34:58.237
What's the ne<i>x</i>t IittIe bit?

34:59.442 --> 35:01.376
Getting married.

35:01.578 --> 35:06.515
You can do that too.
Just Iike you've done everything eIse.

35:08.418 --> 35:11.785
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.

35:12.288 --> 35:16.224
-E<i>x</i>cuse me for a minute.
-Where you going?

35:16.426 --> 35:20.055
I'm not gonna run away again.
I just want some fresh air.

35:20.463 --> 35:21.930
-Okay.
-Okay.

35:31.141 --> 35:33.666
Oh, fresh air!

35:35.512 --> 35:39.448
-Cover for me.
-Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.

35:39.616 --> 35:41.743
We gotta do something.

35:41.918 --> 35:46.685
Joey won't make it, so I'II Iook around
the hoteI for other weddings.

35:46.856 --> 35:50.622
Don't teII them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

35:51.027 --> 35:52.016
Okay.

36:02.672 --> 36:07.132
Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding.
E<i>x</i>ceIIent.

36:09.245 --> 36:11.042
CongratuIations.

36:11.214 --> 36:12.909
MazeI tov.

36:13.650 --> 36:15.515
Hi! Oh, great hat.

36:17.087 --> 36:20.614
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

36:20.790 --> 36:23.759
I don't know.
Are they Greek Orthodo<i>x</i>?

36:23.927 --> 36:25.622
Yeah. Yeah.

36:25.795 --> 36:30.289
They're my friends,
Monica StephanopoIis.

36:30.667 --> 36:34.797
And ChandIer AcidophiIus.

36:38.975 --> 36:41.910
Hi. Hi.

36:43.246 --> 36:45.146
Hi.

36:47.851 --> 36:49.751
Has anyone seen ChandIer?

36:49.919 --> 36:53.047
-I thought he was with you.
-He was with me.

36:53.223 --> 36:55.919
We're pIaying a IittIe game.
Hide-and-seek.

36:56.092 --> 36:58.993
You can't ask us, son.
That's cheating.

37:03.867 --> 37:07.530
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

37:07.704 --> 37:11.538
He better not come here. He can't see
the bride in her wedding dress.

37:11.708 --> 37:16.008
As I recaII, when we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

37:16.980 --> 37:20.347
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad Iuck then.

37:20.517 --> 37:22.747
Honey, it isn't good Iuck.

37:27.056 --> 37:30.184
Oh, my God! Monica.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.123
I know!

37:33.263 --> 37:36.596
-How's ChandIer doing?
-Great.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.167
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about ChandIer.

37:41.171 --> 37:42.297
Are you okay?

37:43.740 --> 37:45.731
WeII, you're sweating.

37:46.309 --> 37:49.369
Out of happiness for you and ChandIer.

37:49.546 --> 37:52.743
These are beads of joy.

37:53.316 --> 37:54.681
That's sweet.

37:54.851 --> 37:56.580
Don't touch me.

37:57.654 --> 38:01.146
-Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
-Yeah.

38:06.696 --> 38:09.358
-What's going on?
-ChandIer's gone again.

38:09.532 --> 38:15.164
Why wouId you pIay hide-and-seek
with someone you know is a fIight risk?

38:19.075 --> 38:22.511
Aaron, you gotta Iet me go.
The guy's hammered.

38:22.679 --> 38:27.582
I'm sorry. As Iong as he's here
and conscious, we're stiII shooting.

38:36.926 --> 38:40.726
You wouIdn't happen to have
a very big fork?

38:42.432 --> 38:45.128
So I just taIked to the director.

38:45.301 --> 38:48.202
That's it. We're done for the day.

38:49.205 --> 38:50.763
We finished the scene?

38:50.940 --> 38:55.604
-You were wonderfuI.
-As were you.

38:56.546 --> 38:59.106
So I got your car. It's right outside.

38:59.282 --> 39:00.909
Why? Are we done for the day?

39:02.452 --> 39:04.886
That's what you toId me.

39:06.022 --> 39:08.286
Thank you. You're weIcome.

39:09.359 --> 39:13.125
No, we gotta go. Come on.
Here we go.

39:14.731 --> 39:17.097
Is that my ass?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.071
-There he is!
-What?

39:28.878 --> 39:30.903
You're not getting away this time, mister!

39:31.080 --> 39:34.277
UnIess you want
that ass-kicking we taIked about!

39:35.551 --> 39:37.178
Ross!

39:39.989 --> 39:43.550
I'm serious! You're not
waIking out on my sister!

39:43.726 --> 39:45.591
That's right. I'm not.

39:45.762 --> 39:49.323
-Then where have you been?
-I know about Monica.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.491
-You know?
-What?

39:52.669 --> 39:54.364
I heard you and RacheI taIking.

39:54.537 --> 39:57.335
-What? TaIking about what?
-You don't know?

39:57.507 --> 40:00.943
If somebody doesn't teII me
what's going on right now....

40:01.110 --> 40:02.907
What, you'II ''hi-yah''?

40:05.048 --> 40:06.777
Monica's pregnant.

40:08.718 --> 40:10.447
Oh, my God.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.349
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?

40:14.524 --> 40:18.551
I was. Then I went to the gift shop
because I was out of cigarettes.

40:18.728 --> 40:22.027
-Cigarettes?
-Big picture, pIease!

40:23.666 --> 40:27.932
So when I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this.

40:29.706 --> 40:34.040
And I thought, ''Anything
that can fit into this can't be scary.''

40:34.677 --> 40:37.407
You obviousIy didn't see <i>Chucky III.</i>

40:38.781 --> 40:42.273
But come on, Iook at how cute
and smaII this is.

40:42.452 --> 40:47.185
So I got it to give Monica
so she'd know I was okay.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.790
Dude.

40:49.459 --> 40:52.326
Way to go, son.
I knew you'd find him.

41:01.704 --> 41:04.002
Our IittIe boy is getting married.

41:04.173 --> 41:07.233
Look at you, so handsome.

41:07.410 --> 41:09.640
You Iook beautifuI, Mom.

41:12.715 --> 41:15.081
You Iook beautifuI too, Dad.

41:18.621 --> 41:20.486
I Iove you both.

41:20.790 --> 41:22.781
I'm so gIad you're here.

41:28.831 --> 41:30.196
Are you ChandIer?

41:30.967 --> 41:32.992
Are you Joey?

41:38.508 --> 41:41.068
-This is nice.
-What?

41:41.244 --> 41:45.738
I've never waIked down the aisIe
knowing it can't end in divorce.

42:01.464 --> 42:05.161
I wish your grandmother
had Iived to see this.

42:05.334 --> 42:09.498
-She's right there.
-Not that oId crone. My mother.

42:13.109 --> 42:15.339
CongratuIations, darIing.

42:15.578 --> 42:17.637
We Iove you, sweetheart.

42:21.617 --> 42:23.676
You Iook beautifuI.

42:24.554 --> 42:27.045
-Is this new?
-Not now.

42:31.461 --> 42:33.895
-Who's this?
-I'm Father Karabasos.

42:34.430 --> 42:35.897
He's Greek Orthodo<i>x</i>.

42:36.299 --> 42:38.494
As are you.

42:40.670 --> 42:42.297
Let us begin.

42:43.439 --> 42:44.667
DearIy beIoved--

42:44.841 --> 42:46.138
That's my Iine!

42:51.714 --> 42:54.239
I can take it from here. Thanks.

42:56.252 --> 43:00.188
DearIy beIoved,
I'm sorry I'm a IittIe Iate.

43:02.725 --> 43:05.751
You may be confused by this now...

43:05.928 --> 43:09.762
...but you won't be
MemoriaI Day weekend, 2002.

43:12.568 --> 43:16.265
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

43:22.678 --> 43:25.010
We are gathered here today...

43:25.448 --> 43:27.609
...to join this man...

43:28.050 --> 43:32.487
...and this woman
in the bonds of hoIy matrimony.

43:33.422 --> 43:38.792
I've known Monica and ChandIer
for a Iong time, and I cannot imagine...

43:38.961 --> 43:42.488
...two peopIe more perfect
for each other.

43:44.901 --> 43:49.600
And now, as I've Ieft my notes
in my dressing room...

43:50.907 --> 43:53.467
...we shaII proceed to the vows.
Monica?

43:55.578 --> 43:58.240
-He took off?
-Go on. Go on.

44:04.253 --> 44:08.155
ChandIer, for so Iong...

44:08.691 --> 44:12.320
...I wondered if I wouId ever
find my prince.

44:12.728 --> 44:14.525
My souI mate.

44:14.697 --> 44:17.666
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...

44:17.833 --> 44:20.563
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

44:20.736 --> 44:25.833
And instead I found everything that
I'd ever been Iooking for my whoIe Iife.

44:28.744 --> 44:30.473
And now...

44:31.747 --> 44:33.408
...here we are...

44:34.217 --> 44:36.708
...with our future before us.

44:38.120 --> 44:40.680
And I onIy want to spend it with you.

44:42.158 --> 44:43.921
My prince.

44:44.093 --> 44:46.027
My souI mate.

44:46.462 --> 44:48.293
My friend.

44:51.234 --> 44:52.895
UnIess you don't want to.

44:56.072 --> 44:57.562
You go.

44:59.008 --> 45:00.066
ChandIer?

45:01.210 --> 45:02.507
No, that's okay.

45:07.783 --> 45:12.277
I thought this wouId be the most
difficuIt thing I ever had to do.

45:13.723 --> 45:18.217
But when I saw you waIking down
that aisIe, I reaIized it's simpIe.

45:20.863 --> 45:22.194
I Iove you.

45:24.033 --> 45:29.266
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I wiII aIways Iove you.

45:31.641 --> 45:35.338
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my Iife with.

45:35.878 --> 45:38.244
You want to know if I'm sure?

45:41.751 --> 45:44.686
You may now kiss the bride.

45:48.591 --> 45:52.152
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the state of New York...

45:52.328 --> 45:54.853
...and the Internet guys...

45:57.300 --> 46:01.327
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

46:01.504 --> 46:04.473
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

46:04.940 --> 46:06.965
-I do.
-I do.

46:07.143 --> 46:08.735
Yeah, you do!

46:10.246 --> 46:11.338
Rings.

46:11.514 --> 46:13.311
Oh, crap. Okay.

46:15.051 --> 46:16.814
Let's do the rings.

46:28.164 --> 46:30.598
We good? Yeah? Good?

46:31.934 --> 46:33.561
Once again...

46:33.803 --> 46:37.261
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.930
Now kiss her again.

46:54.957 --> 46:56.857
I Iove you.

46:57.026 --> 46:59.051
And I know about the baby.

46:59.995 --> 47:01.963
-What baby?
-Our baby.

47:02.131 --> 47:03.962
We have a baby?

47:05.434 --> 47:07.925
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

47:08.137 --> 47:10.332
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

47:10.506 --> 47:12.371
Then who did?

47:13.275 --> 47:15.072
Look at them.

47:16.011 --> 47:18.536
And they're gonna have a baby.

47:58.687 --> 47:59.676
