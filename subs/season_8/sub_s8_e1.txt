WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:06.578
Oh, my God, we did it!

00:06.756 --> 00:09.657
We just got married. Right there!

00:10.460 --> 00:12.018
Is that your ring?

00:15.231 --> 00:17.062
We're off to a good start.

00:18.234 --> 00:21.829
-And, you sure you're not pregnant?
-Yeah. I'm sure.

00:22.005 --> 00:24.803
But if you're ready to have kids
we got a room upstairs.

00:24.974 --> 00:27.875
I mean, I'll blow off
this party right now. I'll do it!

00:36.586 --> 00:39.180
Okay, you guys,
that ceremony was so beautiful.

00:39.355 --> 00:43.052
Was it?! Was it perfect?!
Is it too soon to see the video?!

00:43.593 --> 00:48.895
Can we just please take a moment?
Our two best friends just got married.

00:49.065 --> 00:53.502
We are so blessed to be able
to share in this incredible joy.

00:53.670 --> 00:56.002
That is so true.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.639
Mon, is it too late to switch
from chicken to steak?

01:01.578 --> 01:06.208
I'm so happy for you guys.
And you are both so lucky!

01:06.382 --> 01:09.874
I mean, you both said the right names

01:11.621 --> 01:13.987
And nobody was drunk.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.419
Okay.

01:15.592 --> 01:18.254
And nobody was gay.

01:19.929 --> 01:22.363
And on your first try.

02:01.704 --> 02:05.140
Great. Great.
Just give me a sec to change film.

02:05.308 --> 02:10.177
I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I'm so excited for you.

02:10.346 --> 02:13.110
-What's going on?
-Monica's pregnant.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.751
Oh, my God. Is that why
you guys had to get married?

02:18.254 --> 02:22.418
-Guys, I'm not pregnant.
-Oh, slow swimmers?

02:24.527 --> 02:27.052
What?! What do you mean?
You're not pregnant?

02:27.230 --> 02:30.791
-You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
-No.

02:31.501 --> 02:33.492
I'll be right back.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.766
You. Take a lot of pictures.

02:37.106 --> 02:39.802
Why don't we get a shot of Monica
and the bloody soldier.

02:39.976 --> 02:42.877
About that, Joey, you have
to change before the party.

02:43.046 --> 02:46.311
-I can't. I don't have any other clothes here.
-Find some, please.

02:46.482 --> 02:50.384
Anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France."

02:50.820 --> 02:53.288
-Fine!
-And be careful who you hug, okay?

02:53.456 --> 02:57.859
My father's upstairs in tears
because you got blood on his dress.

02:59.229 --> 03:02.221
Why don't we see the bride and the groom,
and the bridesmaids.

03:04.033 --> 03:07.230
Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys
that you weren't pregnant?

03:07.403 --> 03:10.065
-Because I'm not.
-We found your tests.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.935
If you're not pregnant..

03:16.679 --> 03:18.806
it's because I am.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.209
What are you talking about?

03:22.385 --> 03:25.843
Yes, I am with child.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.785
I didn't want to say anything
because it's your day.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.793
-I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
-So you told people I was pregnant?

03:34.197 --> 03:37.189
Does this look like a conversation
I want to remember?

03:38.234 --> 03:40.327
-Who's the father?
-Yeah.

03:40.503 --> 03:42.334
I can't say.

03:42.505 --> 03:43.904
-Why?
-Why not?

03:44.574 --> 03:47.907
I can't say because he's famous.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.075
Oh, my God. Who is it?

03:52.282 --> 03:54.273
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.749
Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.

03:59.188 --> 04:02.021
James Brolin is the father of my baby.

04:02.225 --> 04:05.456
As in Barbra Streisand's husband
James Brolin?

04:06.029 --> 04:07.553
What?!

04:07.931 --> 04:09.922
Well, he never said that to me.

04:11.868 --> 04:15.235
Monica, if you step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.

04:15.405 --> 04:17.464
How about just the bridesmaids?

04:17.640 --> 04:20.108
I am the groom.
I was told it was a big deal.

04:20.276 --> 04:22.073
-It is.
-Yeah.

04:24.213 --> 04:25.475
Oh, my God.

04:25.648 --> 04:28.515
Thank you for that.
I can't deal with the stress quite yet.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.550
Instead you told me
Monica was pregnant?

04:30.720 --> 04:33.348
You said she was.
I didn't disagree with you.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.013
Sneaky.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.387
Smile, ladies!

04:38.494 --> 04:41.827
-By the way, James Brolin?
-I know.

04:41.998 --> 04:45.900
I could only think of two names:
him and Ed Begley Jr.

04:46.970 --> 04:52.203
-Then I remembered he's gay, so..
-Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.808
Really?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.180
Congratulations!

04:59.349 --> 05:02.182
Look who's married!
And just in time too, I hear.

05:02.352 --> 05:03.683
What? Ross!

05:05.621 --> 05:09.785
So if you've got this all under control,
I'm just gonna..

05:11.494 --> 05:14.861
I just wanted you to know
that you have made us happier

05:15.031 --> 05:17.192
You have given us more joy..

05:17.367 --> 05:19.062
I'm not pregnant.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.532
What?

05:22.171 --> 05:24.002
I'm not pregnant.

05:25.842 --> 05:27.207
Oh, well.

05:28.111 --> 05:30.602
But I did still get married today.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.441
Whatever.

05:43.826 --> 05:45.487
Thank you very much.

05:45.661 --> 05:49.688
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you:

05:49.866 --> 05:52.460
Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing.

05:58.374 --> 06:03.402
-Before we go out there, I got a present.
-I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.

06:03.579 --> 06:07.071
-No. I've been taking dancing lessons.
-What?

06:07.250 --> 06:11.311
For the last six weeks. I wanted this
to be a moment you'd never forget.

06:11.487 --> 06:13.079
That is so sweet.

06:13.256 --> 06:16.657
So would you care to join me
in our first dance as husband and wife?

06:16.826 --> 06:18.123
Yes.

06:22.732 --> 06:26.532
-What's the matter?
-It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.

06:26.702 --> 06:29.432
-Are you gonna be able to do this?
-Not well.

06:36.345 --> 06:39.746
Well, the good news is,
I don't think anyone's looking at us.

06:40.716 --> 06:43.480
So are you ready to talk about it?

06:44.120 --> 06:45.553
No.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.479
Now?

06:49.892 --> 06:51.223
No!

06:51.594 --> 06:54.256
-We'll talk about something else then.
-Thank you.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.364
Who's the father?

06:56.766 --> 06:58.734
Honey, I haven't told him yet..

06:58.901 --> 07:02.701
so, until I do, I don't think
I should tell anybody else.

07:02.872 --> 07:04.965
That's fine. That's fair.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.267
-Is it Tag?
-Phoebe!

07:07.443 --> 07:09.638
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.473
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?

07:11.647 --> 07:14.582
-Oh, my God, it's Joey!
-Stop it. Okay?

07:14.750 --> 07:17.480
I am not gonna tell you
until I tell him.

07:17.653 --> 07:19.712
At least we know it's a him.

07:26.062 --> 07:27.962
Oh, sweet Lord.

07:28.131 --> 07:30.531
I'm sorry, okay?
I went down to the gift shop.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.897
It was either this or a bathrobe.
What's more important:

07:34.070 --> 07:36.561
The way I'm dressed,
or being with you today?

07:36.739 --> 07:40.402
Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend
I was listening. Hey! Hey!

07:48.017 --> 07:51.544
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
I'm Monica's older brother.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.849
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.751
Hello, Mona from her restaurant.

08:03.332 --> 08:05.892
Mona. What a beautiful name.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.832
You think so?
I always kind of hated it.

08:09.005 --> 08:11.269
Come on! Mona Lisa.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.907
Mona...

08:14.210 --> 08:15.643
Llegglachen.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.010
The famous botanist.

08:19.515 --> 08:23.178
Oh, no, she's..
Well, she's dead now, but..

08:23.619 --> 08:28.283
Supposedly she was once
quite the hottie of the plant world.

08:28.457 --> 08:29.719
Really?

08:29.892 --> 08:34.022
-See, I never knew about her.
-Linda Llegglachen..

08:38.167 --> 08:40.465
So, what table are you at?

08:42.471 --> 08:43.768
Me too.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.909
Good. Now there'll be someone there
who likes my name.

08:47.076 --> 08:48.907
Yes, there will.

08:55.585 --> 09:00.887
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

09:01.057 --> 09:05.756
And if it's all right with you,
I'll take your place at table six.

09:05.928 --> 09:08.362
Martin Llegglachen.

09:09.932 --> 09:14.164
That's better. Now, just bend your arms
a little bit. Now look straight ahead.

09:14.337 --> 09:17.773
This time I want you
to really put your ass into it.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.510
Who's slippery now?

09:25.381 --> 09:30.250
Isn't that just the best feeling?
Rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe?

09:31.454 --> 09:35.117
Chandler, darling, look,
my date has finally arrived.

09:35.291 --> 09:40.058
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
Dennis, this is my son, Chandler.

09:40.229 --> 09:42.561
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

09:42.732 --> 09:44.927
Dennis is a dear old friend..

09:45.101 --> 09:48.070
and a fantastic lover.

09:49.972 --> 09:52.167
Are my ears bleeding?

09:53.476 --> 09:57.412
Don't mind Chandler.
He's always been shy.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.877
Oh, you're right.

09:59.048 --> 10:02.381
Bravo, Dennis.
Thanks for pleasing my mother so.

10:03.986 --> 10:07.353
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.
I was stuck at auditions.

10:07.523 --> 10:10.424
Yes, Dennis is directing
a new Broadway show.

10:10.593 --> 10:12.754
I don't believe we've met.
Joey Tribbiani.

10:12.928 --> 10:15.920
-Dennis Phillips.
-I've admired your work for years.

10:16.098 --> 10:19.090
-You've done some really amazing stuff.
-Thank you.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.828
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get myself a drink.

10:22.004 --> 10:23.494
I'll be back in a moment.

10:26.142 --> 10:27.609
Okay. You stop.

10:30.946 --> 10:34.143
Dennis Phillips. That's great.
How did you guys meet?

10:34.317 --> 10:38.845
-Well, it's a funny story.
-Funny, "ha-ha"? Or funny:

10:47.530 --> 10:52.729
Thank you. If everyone will please
take your seats, dinner will be served.

11:04.447 --> 11:08.816
-I thought you were at table six.
-No. Nine.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.753
See, before, when you showed it to me,
you held it that way..

11:16.926 --> 11:19.451
which was misleading.

11:30.473 --> 11:31.804
Hello.

11:38.481 --> 11:42.713
Will you see if your mom can give
my resume to Dennis Phillips?

11:42.885 --> 11:48.221
Well, they've kind of locked themselves in
one of the men's room stalls right now.

11:49.425 --> 11:51.518
Perhaps when they get out.

11:52.027 --> 11:55.326
If I could get in a Broadway show,
then I would've done it all.

11:55.498 --> 11:57.295
Film, television and theater.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.924
The only thing left would be radio.
But that's just for ugly people.

12:02.371 --> 12:05.704
-What size shoes do you wear?
-Eleven, 11¨ö.

12:05.875 --> 12:09.834
My shoes give me a problem on the
dance floor. Can I borrow your boots?

12:10.012 --> 12:13.072
I don't really even know
where I left those.

12:15.117 --> 12:19.019
-Those aren't 11 ¨ö.
-Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

12:19.188 --> 12:23.522
I have surprisingly small feet.
But the rest of me is good. I'll show you.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.025
Who am I kidding?
I belong in radio.

12:33.602 --> 12:38.164
-Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
-Let's not talk about that right now.

12:38.441 --> 12:42.275
-This is so huge.
-Sure, but as big as your wedding?

12:42.445 --> 12:44.879
Of course not. Nothing is.

12:46.282 --> 12:48.648
Between me and you,
in this day and age..

12:48.818 --> 12:51.184
how dumb do you have to be
to get pregnant?

12:51.353 --> 12:55.687
Sometimes you can do everything right.
Everyone wears what they're supposed to..

12:55.858 --> 12:58.622
and one of those little guys
just gets through.

12:59.495 --> 13:02.931
-How?
-I don't know. Maybe they have tools.

13:04.233 --> 13:07.669
Well, I talked to her, and she's
definitely gonna have the baby.

13:07.837 --> 13:10.704
She said she's gonna
raise it on her own.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.368
-Well, maybe that's really brave.
-Maybe.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.842
I just hope she realizes how hard
it's gonna be.

13:19.582 --> 13:23.609
Maybe she hasn't really thought it
through that much.

13:23.953 --> 13:26.012
Well, there's a lot to think about.

13:26.188 --> 13:31.490
How is she gonna handle this financially?
How is she gonna juggle work?

13:31.660 --> 13:36.723
Does she realize she's not gonna have
a date again for the next, like, 18 years?

13:39.835 --> 13:41.564
I don't know.

13:43.506 --> 13:45.030
Are you okay?

13:46.876 --> 13:51.245
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.
Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

13:52.381 --> 13:55.407
-Champagne?
-Oh, yes! Thank you very much.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.393
That's actually how the French drink it.

14:16.138 --> 14:21.007
Well, I just got off the phone
with my lover James Brolin.

14:22.378 --> 14:26.280
-Oh, really?
-Apparently, he is married to some singer.

14:28.417 --> 14:33.150
But he said he'd leave her for me.
And I said, "James Brolin, are you sure?"

14:33.455 --> 14:36.185
-James Brolin said..
-Rachel's the one who's pregnant?

14:36.358 --> 14:37.950
What?!

14:39.962 --> 14:41.657
Why bother?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.631
-How do you feel?
-I don't know how I feel.

14:45.801 --> 14:50.465
This is all happening so fast. I have to make
all these decisions that I don't wanna make.

14:50.940 --> 14:53.101
Someone just take this away from me!

14:53.275 --> 14:56.836
-Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
-What?!

14:57.012 --> 15:01.176
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
I took that test, like, three times.

15:01.350 --> 15:06.117
Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

15:06.455 --> 15:08.389
How many ways are there to do that?

15:09.258 --> 15:13.524
I'm just saying, don't freak out
until you're 100 percent sure.

15:14.063 --> 15:17.328
All right, I'll take it again
when I get home.

15:17.633 --> 15:19.601
I can wait until then.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.970
Oh, this is such a good party.
How late does it go till?

15:25.741 --> 15:29.142
-You gotta take it now.
-No, this your wedding.

15:29.311 --> 15:33.680
You're not gonna be able to have fun
until we know. Do it as a present to me.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.014
Okay, thank you.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.348
-I'll run out and get you one.
-You girls are so great.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.922
-Wait a minute. Who's the father?
-She won't tell us.

15:43.092 --> 15:45.959
Come on! It's my wedding.
That could be my present!

15:46.128 --> 15:51.122
-I just gave you peeing on a stick.
-See, this is why you register.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.401
It was the chair again. Okay?
I'm not doing it!

16:03.145 --> 16:05.841
Dad. Can't you go back to your table?

16:06.215 --> 16:12.586
No. Apparently little Molly Gilbert is
enjoying her grown-up salmon en croute.

16:22.531 --> 16:24.624
Look, I don't..
You know what?

16:30.906 --> 16:33.067
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.641
Great.

16:35.944 --> 16:38.879
-Dr. Geller.
-I wasn't farting!

16:42.284 --> 16:44.878
A little game from our table.

16:46.722 --> 16:48.849
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

16:51.593 --> 16:55.552
Maybe later. Right now,
I'm about to dance with this lady.

17:00.002 --> 17:04.996
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

17:05.174 --> 17:08.007
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.208
Yes, I am.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.509
In fact, let's try my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.085
-Sure.
-Yeah? Hop on.

17:23.759 --> 17:27.752
Is the pretty lady looking?
Keep dancing.

17:39.508 --> 17:41.908
And the world will never know.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.811
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

17:45.981 --> 17:49.644
I told him how talented you were
and all about Days of our Lives.

17:49.818 --> 17:54.187
You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.

17:54.356 --> 17:56.449
But you're not just a soap actor.

17:56.625 --> 18:00.288
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

18:02.331 --> 18:06.199
He has no idea
what kind of range I have.

18:07.269 --> 18:08.736
Don't move.

18:10.939 --> 18:13.999
It's like he's running
on tiny little pegs.

18:20.616 --> 18:22.948
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Miranda.

18:23.118 --> 18:24.676
-Melinda.
-All right.

18:25.954 --> 18:30.823
-How cute was that?
-Oh, were you watching?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.995
Can I go next?

18:35.130 --> 18:37.894
Of course you can. Hop on.

18:38.066 --> 18:41.058
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.

18:47.910 --> 18:50.777
-I am so gonna score.
-What?

18:50.946 --> 18:53.210
I like your bow.

18:58.387 --> 19:02.915
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler..

19:03.091 --> 19:07.425
the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

19:07.596 --> 19:12.397
When I first found out they were
getting married, I was a little angry.

19:12.568 --> 19:17.699
I was like, "Why, God? Why?
How can you take them away from me!"

19:19.508 --> 19:25.276
But then I thought back over all our
memories together. Some happy memories.

19:28.050 --> 19:31.451
And there were some sad memories.

19:34.857 --> 19:36.484
I'm sorry.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.719
And some scared memories.

19:46.134 --> 19:50.867
And then I realized
I'll always be their friend.

19:51.039 --> 19:54.736
Their friend who can speak
in many dialects..

19:54.910 --> 19:59.574
and has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.114
To the happy couple.

20:10.092 --> 20:12.959
-Thank you.
-That was very nice, Ashley.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.221
-Can we do it again?
-No, no.

20:16.431 --> 20:20.390
-So, is it my turn now?
-I'm next.

20:23.839 --> 20:27.798
-That's okay, you can dance with her first.
-Are you sure?

20:30.612 --> 20:32.842
-So, what's your name?
-Gert.

20:33.015 --> 20:35.040
That's pretty.

20:41.590 --> 20:44.150
What are you doing there, Gert?

20:45.060 --> 20:48.791
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls did it.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.764
Hop on, Gert.

20:59.408 --> 21:03.174
-Why aren't you moving your feet?
-I'm trying.

21:04.980 --> 21:08.040
Faster. You're not going fast enough.

21:08.216 --> 21:10.946
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

21:15.524 --> 21:19.187
So did you happen to catch
my toast up there?

21:19.361 --> 21:24.196
-Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
-There was a little something for everyone.

21:24.366 --> 21:29.827
-I know you're casting for this new show.
-I don't think you're right for this project.

21:30.005 --> 21:31.563
You're wrong.

21:31.740 --> 21:35.608
Whatever it is, I can do it.
If you didn't see it up there, just try me.

21:35.777 --> 21:39.907
It's an all Chinese cast.
Can you be Chinese?

21:42.017 --> 21:46.750
-Well, I'm not proud of this, but..
-Oh, my God. Please don't!

21:48.957 --> 21:53.018
-Ready to get back to the dance floor?
-Did it turn into sand?

21:53.195 --> 21:58.599
-Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine.
-No. No, I won't.

21:59.034 --> 22:01.502
Do you know why
I took all those lessons?

22:01.670 --> 22:06.300
I didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen on the dance floor..

22:06.475 --> 22:07.942
with some clumsy idiot.

22:08.110 --> 22:11.045
Oh, sweetie,
you could never embarrass me.

22:11.213 --> 22:15.809
Okay, you could easily embarrass me.
But it doesn't matter, all right?

22:15.984 --> 22:17.542
I married you.

22:17.719 --> 22:20.984
No matter what you do,
I'm gonna come home with you, okay?

22:21.156 --> 22:24.319
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night
with my husband. Come on.

22:24.493 --> 22:29.453
But I'll tell you, that's the last time I buy
shoes at the Slippery Fun Shoe store.

22:31.566 --> 22:34.364
Just try not to move your feet at all.

22:41.176 --> 22:43.235
There you go.

22:45.213 --> 22:47.738
-I'm gonna have you arrested.
-Why?

22:47.916 --> 22:49.440
You stole my moves!

22:53.588 --> 22:56.216
Oh, Chandler, you're quite the dancer!

22:57.025 --> 23:00.586
-Thanks, Mrs. Geller.
-Oh, come on, you can call me Mom.

23:01.163 --> 23:02.425
Really?

23:02.597 --> 23:03.859
I will.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.007
Sorry, Mom.

23:23.118 --> 23:25.211
-How much longer?
-30 seconds.

23:25.387 --> 23:27.048
Thirty seconds, okay..

23:27.222 --> 23:29.019
Did I miss it?

23:34.896 --> 23:39.697
I want you to know that
if it's positive, we're gonna..

23:39.868 --> 23:42.769
-I know. I know.
-You do. Okay.

23:45.273 --> 23:46.900
It's time.

23:52.547 --> 23:54.242
Go ahead, Rach.

23:54.950 --> 23:59.546
Wait. You know what? I can't look at it.
Somebody else tell me.

24:04.659 --> 24:05.956
It's negative.

24:07.796 --> 24:10.424
-What?
-It's negative.

24:18.907 --> 24:20.932
Well, there you go.

24:26.515 --> 24:30.178
That is.. That's great.
That is really great, great news.

24:34.089 --> 24:36.523
You know, because the whole..

24:37.893 --> 24:41.920
not being ready and, kind of,
the financial aspects, all that..

24:44.399 --> 24:48.597
This is so just the way
that this was supposed to be.

24:52.307 --> 24:53.968
Then, great.

24:57.379 --> 25:00.109
God, this is so stupid.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.909
How can I be upset
over something I never had?

25:06.655 --> 25:10.523
-It's negative?
-No, it's positive.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.594
-What?
-It's not negative, it's positive.

25:20.835 --> 25:24.202
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I lied before.

25:28.143 --> 25:33.046
-Now you know how you really feel about it.
-That's a risky little game.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.650
Are you really gonna do this?

25:40.121 --> 25:41.520
Yeah.

25:41.690 --> 25:43.624
I'm gonna have a baby.

25:44.726 --> 25:46.819
I'm gonna have a baby.

25:46.995 --> 25:49.020
I'm gonna have a baby!

25:55.403 --> 25:58.839
-With who?
-No, it's still not the time.

26:06.681 --> 26:09.844
I just didn't see the fast song coming.

26:10.018 --> 26:14.114
Don't talk, we'll get you up to your room,
soak your feet. You'll be okay.

26:14.289 --> 26:16.951
-Thank you.
-That is so sweet!

26:17.125 --> 26:20.788
No, I mean it. There are so few
genuinely nice guys out there.

26:20.962 --> 26:24.830
Tell me about it. I feel like I'm
holding down the fort by myself.

26:25.767 --> 26:28.292
-It's Joey, right?
-Yeah.

26:28.470 --> 26:30.233
Wait a minute! No!

26:30.405 --> 26:31.963
I'm the nice one!

26:32.140 --> 26:36.406
I'm the one that danced
with the kids all night. I..

26:36.578 --> 26:38.512
How small are your feet?!
