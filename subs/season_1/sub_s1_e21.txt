00:01.034 --> 00:03.730
Mother, just once,
can we go to lunch...

00:03.937 --> 00:08.806
...and not talk about what I'm wearing
or where my career is going?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.170
Or who I'm dating.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.936
-Ready for the check?
-God, yes.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.978
-I'll take it.
-No, darling.

00:16.182 --> 00:21.017
I said I'll take it.
Here, take it. Go. Run.

00:22.489 --> 00:23.751
Very sweet.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.118
-And on what they pay you
-Career.

00:27.727 --> 00:31.288
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm doing fine.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.523
I'm afraid this has been denied.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.858
That's impossible.

00:36.069 --> 00:39.368
That's all right, dear.
Here you go.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.903
The One With The Fake Monica

01:29.989 --> 01:32.287
How'd someone get your card number?

01:32.492 --> 01:34.858
No idea.
Look how much they spent.

01:35.061 --> 01:38.792
You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.728
Still, it's just
such reckless spending.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.868
When somebody steals...

01:44.137 --> 01:47.004
...they've already thrown caution
to the wind.

01:49.075 --> 01:54.012
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69. 95 on a Wonder Mop.

01:55.548 --> 01:56.810
That's me.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.912
You see, when I say geek, I mean

02:03.123 --> 02:07.219
The hell with it, you bought
a $70 mop, you're a geek.

02:08.094 --> 02:12.155
Oh, yuck. Ross, he's doing it again.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.458
Marcel, stop humping the lamp.

02:14.667 --> 02:18.330
Stop humping. Now, Marcel, come
Come here, Marcel.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.336
Oh, no. Not in my room.
I'll get him.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.032
You've got to do something about that.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.303
What? It's just a phase.

02:26.746 --> 02:29.306
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.177
You'd think you would be
more understanding.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.287
I know. But we're not.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.883
Would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.859
-Marcel, stop it. Marcel. Bad monkey.
-What?

02:44.364 --> 02:47.822
Let's say my Curious George
is no longer curious.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.109
You are not still
going over that thing.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.076
-This woman's living my life.
-What?

03:02.715 --> 03:06.151
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

03:06.819 --> 03:11.381
Look at this. Look. She buys tickets
to plays I wanna see.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.319
She shops where
I'm afraid of the salespeople.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.328
-She spent $300 on art supplies.
-You're not an artist.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.763
I might be if I had the supplies.

03:23.503 --> 03:27.530
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.575
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

03:30.777 --> 03:33.075
Really? Let's compare, shall we?

03:33.279 --> 03:36.180
Oh, it's so late for "shall we."

03:37.283 --> 03:39.478
Do I horseback ride in the park?

03:39.686 --> 03:43.816
-Do I take classes at the New School?
-No.

03:44.490 --> 03:49.359
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

03:57.704 --> 04:01.834
-How about Joey Paponi?
-No, still too ethnic.

04:02.041 --> 04:06.375
-My agent wants a more neutral name.
-Joey Switzerland?

04:11.384 --> 04:17.016
Plus, I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm this big:

04:17.290 --> 04:18.382
Which I'm not.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.293
Joe, Joe, Joe Stalin?

04:26.132 --> 04:27.394
Stalin.

04:28.568 --> 04:31.128
Do I know that name?
It sounds familiar.

04:31.337 --> 04:34.238
Well, it does not
ring a bell with me.

04:34.974 --> 04:38.569
But you're more plugged
into that show business thing.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.804
Joe Stalin.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.948
You know, that's pretty good.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.644
You might wanna try Joseph.

04:55.094 --> 04:56.789
Joseph Stalin.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.362
-I think you'd remember that.
-Yes.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.796
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.474
Joseph Stalin is
the Fiddler on the Roof.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.315
Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

05:24.524 --> 05:29.962
I'm taking some classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.190
I've had a recent head injury
and certain numbers

05:34.400 --> 05:40.100
Barbecue. Oh, did l?
See, there you go.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.300
-What are you doing?
-All right, great.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.446
Great. Thanks a lot.
I'm going to tap class.

05:48.648 --> 05:51.776
To dance with the woman
that stole your card?

05:51.984 --> 05:53.747
To see what she looks like.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.615
I'm sure her picture's up
at the post office.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.348
I should get to see who she is.

05:59.559 --> 06:04.519
You're kind of losing it here.
This is becoming a weird obsession.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.926
This is madness, I tell you.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.159
For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it.

06:12.872 --> 06:13.964
Thank you.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.211
-What do you think?
-Lots of things.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.151
-Which one is she?
-May I help you?

06:29.355 --> 06:32.188
No, thanks. We're
just here to observe.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.226
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.657
Spare shoes are over there.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.328
What does she mean?

06:42.535 --> 06:46.266
I think she means
"You dance a dance class."

06:46.472 --> 06:49.407
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Really?

06:50.476 --> 06:53.070
Do you see anybody
you think could be me?

06:53.312 --> 06:57.976
Last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

06:58.217 --> 07:02.449
-Let's not have that happen again.
-She could be you.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.420
Let's get started.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.493
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:17.737 --> 07:22.436
-Okay, I'm not getting this.
-I'm totally getting it.

07:27.046 --> 07:30.743
Do you ever feel like you're
so uncoordinated?

07:38.691 --> 07:40.818
What? You click when they click.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.153
All right, everyone grab a partner.

07:46.999 --> 07:51.993
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it. I'm with Rachel.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.099
Great, it's gym class all over again.

07:57.343 --> 08:01.177
You can come up to the front
and dance with me.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.940
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

08:10.723 --> 08:15.285
It's okay, it's okay. I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

08:15.528 --> 08:19.521
Okay, here I am.
So who's the new tense girl?

08:19.966 --> 08:23.163
-She's your partner.
-Hi, I'm Monica.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.802
Oh, Monica.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.298
Hi, I'm Mon

08:30.510 --> 08:32.341
-Nana.
-Monana.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.781
-It's Dutch.
-You're kidding.

08:36.983 --> 08:39.508
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.554
Pennsylvania Dutch.

08:46.692 --> 08:51.220
And we're dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.399
Hi.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.275
-Hey. Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

09:06.479 --> 09:10.347
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone?

09:13.152 --> 09:16.144
She says Marcel's humping
is not a phase.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.619
Apparently, he's reached
sexual maturity.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.619
Hey, he beat you.

09:26.332 --> 09:31.463
She says, as time goes on,
he's gonna start getting violent.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.102
So, what does this mean?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.968
I have to give him up.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.492
I can't believe it. This sucks.

09:54.694 --> 09:58.152
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

09:58.397 --> 10:01.525
I know. One day he's
this little thing...

10:01.734 --> 10:06.899
...and then he's this little thing
I can't get off my leg.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.242
Isn't there any way to keep him?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.345
No. The vet said
unless he's in a place...

10:14.580 --> 10:17.014
...where he has regular access...

10:17.817 --> 10:19.978
...to some monkey loving...

10:20.987 --> 10:23.080
... he's just gonna get vicious.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.018
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

10:27.927 --> 10:31.863
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.136
No, that's popes into a Vokswagen.

10:39.839 --> 10:44.708
We're applying to a lot. Our first
choice would be a big state zoo.

10:44.910 --> 10:48.778
You know, like San Diego. Right?

10:49.649 --> 10:53.710
But that may just be a pipe dream.
He's out-of-state.

10:55.955 --> 11:00.289
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

11:00.526 --> 11:05.259
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.263
We found the girl.

11:12.471 --> 11:15.406
-Did you call the cops?
-We took her to lunch.

11:15.608 --> 11:19.305
Oh, your own brand
of vigilante justice.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.775
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.416
She stole. She's a stealer.

11:26.385 --> 11:30.879
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget that.

11:31.390 --> 11:36.123
I mean, she's this astounding person
with this amazing spirit.

11:36.328 --> 11:39.491
Which she probably stole
from some cheerleader.

11:41.901 --> 11:45.268
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Vokswagen.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.403
I love that joke.

11:53.112 --> 11:57.811
-No way. No way did you do this.
-Monana was very brave.

11:58.684 --> 12:02.745
We told them we were
the Gundersons in room 61 5...

12:02.955 --> 12:07.085
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire floor.

12:07.293 --> 12:10.729
When they saw that we're short
and have breasts....

12:11.430 --> 12:15.628
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel. Me.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.132
Go, Monana.

12:19.271 --> 12:22.866
You ladies are not the only ones
living the dream.

12:23.142 --> 12:27.875
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.310
Oh, by the way...

12:31.617 --> 12:35.348
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.189
-Excuse me?
-There's an open call for Cats.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.121
I'm thinking we sing "Memories"...

12:42.361 --> 12:46.661
...and make complete fools
of ourselves. What do you say?

12:46.866 --> 12:51.166
No, no, no. Remember who you're
dealing with here.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.601
I can't even stand in front
of a tap class.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.970
That's because
of your Amish background.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.008
-What?
-You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

13:02.214 --> 13:06.674
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

13:08.687 --> 13:14.250
I was just like you. And then, one day,
I saw a movie that changed my life.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.318
Did you ever see
Dead Poets Society?

13:17.530 --> 13:22.331
I thought that movie was
so incredibly boring.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.695
That thing at the end where the kid...

13:25.971 --> 13:29.930
...kills himself
because he can't be in the play?

13:30.176 --> 13:36.172
It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater."

13:37.183 --> 13:43.418
I thought, "That's two hours of
my life that I'm never getting back."

13:43.622 --> 13:48.116
That scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.627
Wow. Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.473
Oh, God.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.905
We didn't get into Scranton.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.812
That was, like, our safety zoo.

14:10.716 --> 14:13.879
They take, like, dogs and cows.

14:16.222 --> 14:20.886
See, I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.686
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

14:26.999 --> 14:30.127
Marcel. Marcel. Marcel, no.

14:31.737 --> 14:35.571
Good boy. See?
How can nobody want him?

14:35.841 --> 14:37.672
Somebody will.

14:40.679 --> 14:43.341
You know, there already
is a Joseph Stalin.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.953
You're kidding.

14:51.156 --> 14:56.856
Apparently, he was this Russian
dictator who slaughtered people.

14:57.229 --> 15:01.723
-You'd think you would've known that.
-You'd think I would've.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.528
Hey, how about Joey Heatherton?

15:06.205 --> 15:10.539
Come on, I told you
I don't wanna go back to Joey.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.638
What do you think a good
stage name for me would be?

15:19.585 --> 15:20.916
Flame Boy.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.289
Where exactly is your zoo?

15:30.496 --> 15:33.158
Well, it's technically
not a zoo, per se.

15:33.399 --> 15:37.495
It's more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.797
Let me ask you some questions
about Marcel.

15:41.907 --> 15:47.436
-Does he fight with other animals?
-No, no. He's very docile.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.080
Even if he were cornered?

15:53.218 --> 15:55.550
Well, I don't know. Why?

15:55.821 --> 15:58.847
How is he at handling small objects?

16:00.092 --> 16:03.619
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.962
What about a hammer or a small blade?

16:10.502 --> 16:13.369
Why would he need a blade?

16:13.572 --> 16:16.439
If he's up against
an animal with horns...

16:16.642 --> 16:18.974
...you got to give him something.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.408
Otherwise, it's just cruel.

16:24.249 --> 16:27.582
-He got into San Diego.
-What?

16:27.786 --> 16:31.244
We came back from our walk.
The phone was ringing....

16:31.457 --> 16:32.481
He's in.

16:32.691 --> 16:38.027
Did you hear that, Marcel?
San Diego. San Diego.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.222
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's good...

16:41.433 --> 16:44.925
... but I'll start him off
against a blind rabbit...

16:45.137 --> 16:47.901
...and give you 20% of the gate.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.691
Where have you been?

17:09.895 --> 17:13.058
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.091
I think I kissed an archbishop.

17:18.437 --> 17:21.338
But, of course,
it could've been a chef.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.975
-Are you drunk?
-No.

17:31.216 --> 17:36.449
-I'm lying. I am so drunk.
-Oh, God.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.055
You know what?
You could've called.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.227
I've been worried Monica.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.000
Water rules.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.103
Yes. Yes, it does.

17:55.407 --> 17:59.468
The restaurant called. They wanna
know if you're showing up for work.

17:59.945 --> 18:03.779
Nope. Going to
the Big Apple Circus today.

18:04.149 --> 18:08.017
You're gonna lose your job.
This is not you.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.812
No, it is me.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.321
I'm not just the person
who fluffs the pillows...

18:13.592 --> 18:15.787
...and pays the bills right away.

18:16.028 --> 18:20.988
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.600
I'm Monana.

18:31.777 --> 18:36.111
Hello? Yes, she is.
Hold on a second please.

18:36.381 --> 18:41.045
Monana, it's for you.
The credit card people.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.481
Hello.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.789
Yes?

18:48.093 --> 18:49.492
Oh, my God.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.262
-Thanks.
-What?

18:55.267 --> 18:57.895
They've arrested Monica.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.475
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.309
How are you?

19:12.518 --> 19:16.045
Not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.581
How did you know I was here?

19:19.892 --> 19:24.420
Because I'm Monica Geller.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.655
It was my credit card you were using.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.330
That I was not expecting.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.994
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.868
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.540
You have given me so much.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.976
I'd never have gotten to sing...

19:43.182 --> 19:45.844
... "Memories" at
the Winter Garden Theater.

19:46.051 --> 19:49.214
Actually, you only got
to sing "Memo"

19:50.556 --> 19:54.458
I can't believe you're here.
What will I do without you?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.127
Who's gonna crash
parties with me?

19:57.362 --> 20:00.195
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

20:00.399 --> 20:04.529
I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women...

20:04.803 --> 20:09.001
...and you're worried about who'll
take you to the circus?

20:10.309 --> 20:13.972
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.670
There's nothing to wonder about.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.909
You'll go back to being who you were.
That's who you are.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.553
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

20:23.755 --> 20:27.589
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

20:30.762 --> 20:36.701
-I'm not actually Amish.
-Really? Then why are you like that?

20:51.750 --> 20:56.449
-You, by the door, in or out?
-ln.

21:01.860 --> 21:06.024
-You're getting it all wrong.
-But at least I'm doing it.

21:20.712 --> 21:24.478
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67...

21:24.783 --> 21:26.944
... to San Diego at gate 42A.

21:27.219 --> 21:32.919
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.
All right, I wrote you this poem.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.253
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.929
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.732
Okay, bye, champ.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.837
There'll be a lot
of babes in San Diego...

21:48.040 --> 21:51.635
... but remember,
there's also a lot to learn.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.908
I don't know what to say, Ross.
It's a monkey.

22:01.119 --> 22:04.555
Just say what you feel, Joey.

22:05.590 --> 22:09.048
-Marcel, I'm hungry.
-That was good.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.855
Marcel, this is for you.

22:15.067 --> 22:19.527
It's just, you know, something...

22:19.738 --> 22:22.036
...to do on the plane.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.441
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment alone.

22:27.646 --> 22:30.638
-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.

22:35.587 --> 22:40.081
Marcel, come here. Come here.
Come here.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.260
Well, buddy...

22:43.995 --> 22:45.656
...this is it.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.924
Just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.898
I'm really gonna miss you.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.938
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

22:56.141 --> 23:01.044
You've been more than
just a pet to me.

23:01.246 --> 23:04.875
You've been more like a
Okay. Marcel.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.882
Would you leave my leg alone?

23:08.086 --> 23:11.180
Would you stop humping me
for two seconds?

23:11.390 --> 23:15.759
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

23:37.616 --> 23:41.382
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand...

23:41.586 --> 23:45.022
...that I might touch thy cheek.

23:45.223 --> 23:50.251
-That's fine. Thank you.
-Next.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.495
I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

23:56.701 --> 23:59.795
-Name?
-Holden McGroin.
