WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:06.065
Hey, new wallet?

00:06.206 --> 00:07.366
It was time.

00:07.574 --> 00:11.806
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

00:12.045 --> 00:15.674
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

00:15.915 --> 00:18.645
I know,
but the garbage was full.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.887
Have you ever taken out the trash?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.988
Since you've lived here?

00:26.126 --> 00:29.618
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.229
-Third door on the left.
-Right!

00:46.379 --> 00:47.937
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.226
What are you doing?

01:13.506 --> 01:14.495
I'm sorry.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.504
It's a little old but....

01:18.244 --> 01:21.338
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

01:21.614 --> 01:25.482
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.516
Of course not.
You're a little princess.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.487
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.420
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

01:33.626 --> 01:37.528
Daddy, make the cast of Cats
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.496
You think you can come here...

01:40.767 --> 01:44.601
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

01:44.804 --> 01:47.864
Think of someone else for a change.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.706
Okay, I'm sorry.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.280
God, if you're going to cry about it!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.025
The One With Ballroom Dancing

02:52.805 --> 02:54.898
Treeger made you cry?

02:55.608 --> 02:59.908
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.945
I'll teach him a lesson.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.640
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

03:05.885 --> 03:09.787
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

03:09.989 --> 03:13.288
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

03:16.796 --> 03:18.058
Is this a gym card?

03:18.264 --> 03:20.494
Oh, yeah, gym member.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.267
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

03:24.504 --> 03:25.937
...the last 1200 times.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.467
So why don't you quit?

03:30.343 --> 03:32.243
You don't think I've tried?

03:34.647 --> 03:38.515
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

03:38.851 --> 03:41.911
They make you go
all the way down there.

03:42.355 --> 03:46.587
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.952
And then they bring out Maria.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.624
-Who is Maria?
-Oh, Maria!

03:54.267 --> 03:55.791
You can't say no to her.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.802
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.775
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

04:06.012 --> 04:07.775
You're strong enough to face her?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.972
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.687
Tribbiani.
Hold on.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.049
I'll get the plunger.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.193
You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.558
So you'll go and apologize to her...

04:27.800 --> 04:29.734
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.163
And tell him what?

04:31.371 --> 04:33.896
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."

04:34.173 --> 04:38.633
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.639
I have actually not heard of that.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.015
Your friends are violating it.

04:46.319 --> 04:49.755
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.547
I'm telling the landlord...

04:51.758 --> 04:55.023
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.560
Your friends are out of here, pal.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.933
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

05:05.672 --> 05:08.334
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.768
What's the matter?

05:10.043 --> 05:13.171
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.108
Every time I see him,
I want to...

05:15.381 --> 05:17.713
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.847
So do them for free.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.083
No, it is forbidden.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.797
Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.533
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.431
-They make you take an oath?
-No, I made myself take one.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.868
No fooling around with clients...

05:41.074 --> 05:43.440
...and always be prepared.

05:46.379 --> 05:50.281
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.019
Why not give him to someone else?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.950
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.651
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.559
You got a pedicure.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.285
Your feet are all dressed up.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.830
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

06:12.105 --> 06:14.164
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

06:14.741 --> 06:17.676
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.109
How do you explain the toe ring?

06:23.583 --> 06:27.485
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

06:33.159 --> 06:34.751
My hero! What happened?

06:35.862 --> 06:38.922
I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

06:39.165 --> 06:41.156
And he better apologize.
See you!

06:41.434 --> 06:42.924
Wait a minute.

06:43.603 --> 06:44.592
What did he say?

06:46.005 --> 06:49.668
He wouldn't apologize because
you're living here illegally.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.674
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

06:52.879 --> 06:56.144
-You got us evicted?
-I told you not to go down there.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.610
He made Rachel cry!

06:57.850 --> 06:59.545
Rachel always cries!

07:00.820 --> 07:02.845
That's not true!

07:04.657 --> 07:07.524
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.557
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

07:11.864 --> 07:13.889
All right, I'll try.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.159
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.531
-Go!
-All right, all right.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.400
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

07:27.513 --> 07:31.745
Remember what we talked about.
You got to be strong.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.383
Now one more time.

07:35.655 --> 07:39.113
Don't you want a washboard stomach
and rock-hard pecs?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.921
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.294
That's good.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.305
I want to quit the gym.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.407
You want to quit?

07:59.178 --> 08:00.839
I want to quit the gym.

08:01.447 --> 08:05.679
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.750
I want to quit the gym.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.918
Dave in the membership office
handles quitters.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.631
Excuse me.
Are you a member?

08:23.269 --> 08:24.361
Me?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.772
Sorry. Members only.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.506
I want to quit the gym!

08:32.712 --> 08:35.272
It's okay, man.
Be strong.

08:41.954 --> 08:44.115
Are you a member of any gym?

08:44.357 --> 08:48.054
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.785
Okay, no problem.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.393
Could you come here?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.900
Hi, I'm Maria.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.118
You have really pretty feet.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.277
These old things?

09:17.924 --> 09:21.792
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.057
You mean....

09:25.264 --> 09:27.789
By sciatic, you mean...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.332
...the towel-covered portion?

09:31.971 --> 09:33.836
Sure, I can do that.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.668
Because the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

09:37.944 --> 09:40.310
...real nice and tight.

09:44.784 --> 09:49.016
So tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

09:49.255 --> 09:52.122
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.864
-Did you just bite me?
-No!

10:15.548 --> 10:18.984
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.881
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

10:22.221 --> 10:25.520
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

10:26.025 --> 10:28.016
You have pets?

10:29.528 --> 10:31.120
Those are nicknames.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.865
I'm the "chick,"
and Chandler's the "duck."

10:35.534 --> 10:38.367
I would've thought
it was the other way around.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.733
Come on.
Let the girls stay.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.669
I'll do whatever you want.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.739
Really? You'd do anything?

10:46.045 --> 10:47.239
Yeah, absolutely.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.411
I got something.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.708
What is it?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.549
Can you be my dancing partner?

10:58.391 --> 11:00.382
That's not prison lingo, is it?

11:02.862 --> 11:06.059
I want to quit the gym.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.663
Can you honestly tell me that you're
100% satisfied with your body.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.793
Yes, yes. Most of the time.

11:11.937 --> 11:16.533
I mean, sure, I have my bad days, but
then I remember what a cute smile I have.

11:17.043 --> 11:20.376
We were voted "Best-equipped Gym
in New York" two years running.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.539
-Do you really want to give that up?
-Yes, I hate it here.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.210
Everything that you have
in here is very heavy.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.482
Really? Okay?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.195
You want to make your
friend work out alone?

11:38.631 --> 11:42.567
-What friend?
-Your friend Ross. Just joined.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.737
His dancing partner?

11:54.947 --> 11:58.383
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball."

12:00.753 --> 12:04.519
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.748
Why not practice with a girl?

12:06.959 --> 12:08.017
He's too shy.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.219
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.419
Yeah, right.

12:12.598 --> 12:16.967
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.936
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.204
So did you quit?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.044
I almost did.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.649
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.113
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

12:39.358 --> 12:41.087
And that's funny, why?

12:43.462 --> 12:47.762
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and....

12:49.101 --> 12:50.090
Well, that's it.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.038
We're doomed.

12:53.272 --> 12:57.800
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.068
What are we gonna do?

13:00.246 --> 13:01.975
You could actually go to the gym.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.782
Or we could go to the bank...

13:11.056 --> 13:14.890
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.955
You're a genius.

13:18.164 --> 13:21.463
Oh, man! But then,
we won't be bank buddies.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.833
Now there's two reasons.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.472
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

13:33.679 --> 13:34.805
I bit him.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.845
-Where?
-On the tushy.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.213
And that's not against your oath?

13:43.222 --> 13:45.884
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

13:46.091 --> 13:50.323
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.226
Next time, try to distract yourself.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.934
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

13:57.203 --> 14:00.070
...and I don't want to get too...

14:00.339 --> 14:01.772
...excited.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.807
I try and think of other things.
Like sandwiches...

14:06.011 --> 14:07.842
...and baseball...

14:09.915 --> 14:11.405
...and Chandler.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.613
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.887
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.258
Okay, well...

14:28.300 --> 14:30.131
...just follow my lead.

14:31.904 --> 14:35.362
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

14:35.674 --> 14:37.767
Like get really drunk?

14:37.977 --> 14:41.640
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.819
I'm sorry.

14:51.023 --> 14:54.083
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

14:54.293 --> 14:56.284
...my breasts are coming out my back.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.263
Forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

15:00.866 --> 15:01.855
My mom was right.

15:02.101 --> 15:05.332
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.064
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.674
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.441
Marge will never go for me.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.108
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.144
You just need more practice.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.515
Come on.
Let's try it again.

15:28.794 --> 15:31.558
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.358
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a

15:41.407 --> 15:43.898
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

15:48.213 --> 15:49.976
You guys owe me bigtime.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.386
What was that?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.784
You just did a little dancy thing.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.291
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.326
-You did a little hop.
-You are so enjoying this.

16:06.532 --> 16:07.897
No, I'm not.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.159
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourree.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.403
You know the words!

16:16.642 --> 16:18.303
You are so into this!

16:18.544 --> 16:22.913
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

16:23.882 --> 16:28.182
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.489
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

16:31.757 --> 16:34.726
It's like a sport, it's manly.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.896
-Show me some "manly" moves.
-All right.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.391
I don't know how to lead.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.534
Hello.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.405
We'd like to close our accounts.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.148
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.916
No, we'd just like to close them.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.053
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.315
Would you come over here, please?

17:09.161 --> 17:10.253
Hi, I'm Karen.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.231
I want to quit the bank!

17:17.836 --> 17:19.565
Okay. Baseball.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.433
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.108
Maybe even his pants
come down a little.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.607
Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.714
Okay, on a plate.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.785
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.588
Chandler.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.890
Okay, Chandler.
That's working!

17:49.268 --> 17:52.101
Chandler's knees.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.407
Chandler's ankles.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.598
Chandler's ankle hair.

17:58.377 --> 17:59.275
Oh, no!

18:00.279 --> 18:01.712
Okay, you're all set.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.707
Wow! That was amazing!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.817
Was that really just an hour?

18:07.786 --> 18:10.584
In really long-hour world.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.586
What?

18:15.961 --> 18:17.826
I have an enormous crush on you.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.891
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

18:21.166 --> 18:23.930
...even though you give me
the feelings.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.329
I had no idea.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.500
I can always find another masseuse.

18:32.010 --> 18:32.999
Really?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.246
Yeah, really.

18:40.586 --> 18:41.575
What?

18:41.820 --> 18:44.152
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.683
Quiet down.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.830
Mr. Simon's been waiting
Oh, my God!

18:54.099 --> 18:55.532
Why wasn't I offered that?

18:56.201 --> 18:58.635
I'd definitely pay more for that.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.868
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.907
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

19:07.112 --> 19:09.637
...because Rick is my husband.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.409
Oh, really?

19:11.617 --> 19:13.778
You'd better tell his other wife.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.546
She called three times
asking where he is.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.884
Yes, I will tell her.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.630
So you didn't leave the bank?

19:27.399 --> 19:31.267
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.697
What will you ever use that for?

19:34.907 --> 19:37.501
To pay for the gym.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.837
So I had a great day.

19:43.048 --> 19:45.414
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.915
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.183
-You got fired?
-Oh, my gosh!

19:52.424 --> 19:56.292
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.120
Sweetie.

19:58.397 --> 20:02.356
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

20:02.601 --> 20:07.231
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

20:07.639 --> 20:10.631
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.605
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.477
Hey, Duck.
Is Chick here?

20:24.223 --> 20:27.090
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.457
Ready for our last practice?

20:30.762 --> 20:34.858
We're not getting that spin right
because my place is too small.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.503
-Want to use our place?
-No, I had another idea.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.007
We did it!

21:22.614 --> 21:24.343
That was incredible!

21:24.616 --> 21:28.108
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

21:28.320 --> 21:31.221
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.654
Oh, my God!
Look at the time.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.951
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.487
Good luck.

21:40.732 --> 21:44.793
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

21:45.003 --> 21:47.369
Thanks, but no.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.601
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

21:53.745 --> 21:56.009
-Go get them, Treeger.
-Right.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.988
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.215
Really?

22:06.458 --> 22:09.086
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

22:09.561 --> 22:10.994
No, I'm good.

22:26.311 --> 22:29.075
It looks like you've got
great experience.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.812
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.645
They thought I was a whore.

22:35.620 --> 22:40.057
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.253
Great. Thank you very much.
