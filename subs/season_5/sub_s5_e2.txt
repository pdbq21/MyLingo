WEBVTT

00:11.961 --> 00:13.519
You look cute in bubbles.

00:13.797 --> 00:16.163
You're just all liquored up.

00:19.302 --> 00:21.361
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

00:28.378 --> 00:30.869
I've had a very long, hard day.

00:33.183 --> 00:36.346
-You're home early.
-Yeah, my date threw up.

00:37.587 --> 00:38.918
Want some chicken?

00:39.089 --> 00:41.148
No, thanks. No chicken.
Bye-bye.

00:43.059 --> 00:45.493
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

00:45.729 --> 00:48.061
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!

00:48.264 --> 00:49.663
All right.

00:53.837 --> 00:55.634
Are you okay?
He wouldn't leave.

00:55.905 --> 00:58.305
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

00:58.608 --> 00:59.768
Chicken?

01:01.077 --> 01:02.669
I could eat some chicken.

01:08.418 --> 01:12.946
Could I get a three-piece,
some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

01:13.189 --> 01:14.656
Diet Coke.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.425
The One With All the Kissing

01:58.802 --> 02:01.669
-Morning, Phoebe.
-I have to tell you this story.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.169
I was coming over
and this cabdriver

02:04.407 --> 02:05.499
Was his name Angus?

02:07.143 --> 02:08.167
What?

02:08.411 --> 02:10.675
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.

02:12.682 --> 02:14.309
All right. Anyway

02:14.551 --> 02:16.815
What was that pub he took us to?

02:17.053 --> 02:18.213
The Wheat Sheaf!

02:18.488 --> 02:20.046
And they had that beer....

02:20.256 --> 02:21.883
Boddington's!

02:25.094 --> 02:27.221
Phoebe was going to tell a story.

02:27.430 --> 02:30.160
So he had a really funny hat.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.697
I don't want to talk about it.

02:34.437 --> 02:36.268
-Hey.
-Hey, Ross!

02:36.706 --> 02:38.503
Boddington's!

02:38.741 --> 02:40.174
Oh, man!

02:41.411 --> 02:45.609
I'd walk back to London for another
frosty one of those bad boys.

02:45.882 --> 02:48.908
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.

02:49.219 --> 02:50.584
Later!

02:51.688 --> 02:53.212
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

02:53.456 --> 02:54.923
Her plane got delayed.

02:55.225 --> 02:56.954
But she should be here by now.

02:57.193 --> 02:59.923
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?

03:00.363 --> 03:02.092
No. But she likes me.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.196
You abandoned her
on a plane to Greece.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.302
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

03:08.571 --> 03:10.436
Emily showed up at the airport.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.734
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.

03:13.977 --> 03:16.445
She's my wife.
Rachel is my wife.

03:16.713 --> 03:17.873
Emily!

03:19.749 --> 03:22.479
Emily is my wife.

03:23.052 --> 03:24.986
Man, what is that?

03:26.055 --> 03:27.920
You haven't heard from Emily?

03:28.124 --> 03:30.217
Not since I lost her at the airport.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.451
I can't believe she can outrun you.

03:32.729 --> 03:35.220
Hey! She's fast, okay?

03:35.798 --> 03:39.393
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!

03:41.771 --> 03:44.569
-I'm sorry. I'm just a little
-Slow?

03:44.741 --> 03:46.606
Oh, you want some?!

03:46.776 --> 03:50.007
Okay, get the shoes on! Let's go, man!

03:50.179 --> 03:52.044
It's cool, okay?

03:52.215 --> 03:54.615
You're the fastest!

03:55.618 --> 03:58.348
-Hi!
-Oh, my God, Rachel!

03:59.522 --> 04:04.118
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

04:04.394 --> 04:06.885
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.

04:09.399 --> 04:12.800
That's it? You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.061
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

04:16.205 --> 04:20.005
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,
met the nice people.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.473
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

04:25.548 --> 04:27.175
So, what, that's it?

04:28.818 --> 04:31.480
We're cool. Totally cool.

04:32.255 --> 04:33.984
Thanks, Rach.
You're the best.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.522
Oh, no. You're the best.

04:37.994 --> 04:40.588
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.159
No one will tell me where Emily is...

04:44.400 --> 04:48.530
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.

04:48.771 --> 04:51.706
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

04:51.908 --> 04:53.569
That should get her talking.

04:53.776 --> 04:58.110
When you make out the card,
be sure to make it out to "Emily."

05:02.752 --> 05:05.585
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.

05:06.789 --> 05:07.915
What?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.857
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

05:12.595 --> 05:14.790
Ross abandoned me!

05:15.031 --> 05:19.229
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!

05:19.469 --> 05:24.406
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

05:24.807 --> 05:28.106
I mean, it was so humiliating!

05:28.311 --> 05:30.438
I felt like such an idiot!

05:30.646 --> 05:32.978
It's all my fault.
You know why?

05:33.216 --> 05:36.583
Because I make very bad decisions.

05:36.786 --> 05:37.980
Oh, that's not true.

05:38.287 --> 05:41.723
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!

05:41.958 --> 05:44.756
London is stupid! Stupid!

05:46.062 --> 05:49.327
I put on a cheerleading outfit
to seduce Joshua.

05:49.499 --> 05:54.163
Then I lost him because I asked him
to marry me after four dates.

05:54.337 --> 05:58.671
And then I went to Greece
on somebody else's honeymoon. Okay?

05:58.841 --> 06:02.140
Do those sound like very good
decisions to you?

06:02.645 --> 06:04.806
I like your little braid.

06:05.581 --> 06:07.742
I just shouldn't be allowed
to make decisions anymore.

06:07.917 --> 06:10.579
Phoebe, you were right.
I should've never gone to London.

06:10.820 --> 06:14.153
From now on, you make
all my decisions for me.

06:14.323 --> 06:16.814
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.

06:17.060 --> 06:21.019
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.

06:21.230 --> 06:22.595
I'll do it.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.796
Fine. Monica, you are now
in charge of my love life.

06:29.072 --> 06:30.767
Okay. I got to go to work.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.445
And Rachel, great to have you back.

06:55.731 --> 06:57.096
Always a pleasure.

07:06.075 --> 07:08.100
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

07:08.311 --> 07:10.779
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.275
He's married.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.416
Ross is married.
I still can't believe it.

07:16.085 --> 07:18.315
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

07:18.988 --> 07:20.717
I'll just have to accept it.

07:20.923 --> 07:22.584
I mean, it's my fault.

07:23.159 --> 07:25.184
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

07:25.428 --> 07:27.362
Oh, my God!

07:32.168 --> 07:35.467
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.

07:35.671 --> 07:37.468
I know that wasn't about me.

07:37.773 --> 07:39.764
I bet it was about her a little.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.507
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

07:42.712 --> 07:45.613
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.

07:45.848 --> 07:46.940
Look. Gunther.

07:49.852 --> 07:51.444
He's nice. He's cute.

07:51.988 --> 07:54.013
Yeah. I guess Gunther is....

07:54.357 --> 07:56.257
What about that guy over there?

07:57.460 --> 08:00.258
That's the guy you flirted with
at the counter.

08:01.697 --> 08:04.825
-Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
-You're going to talk to him.

08:05.101 --> 08:08.696
I make your decisions,
and I say you're going to talk to him.

08:09.639 --> 08:10.799
All right.

08:11.007 --> 08:14.170
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.

08:14.443 --> 08:16.638
Say that to him, and you're golden.

08:22.718 --> 08:25.619
Hey, Phoebe.
We got our pictures back from London.

08:25.855 --> 08:28.551
Here's all of us
at the Tower of London....

08:29.025 --> 08:30.652
Here we all are.

08:31.127 --> 08:33.618
There's Ross and Joey and you and

08:35.164 --> 08:36.188
And me.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.298
We've been talking about
London too much.

08:40.803 --> 08:43.567
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.

08:43.873 --> 08:47.331
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.

08:47.543 --> 08:49.010
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

08:50.246 --> 08:52.476
Know what I like to do?
It sounds a little corny...

08:52.648 --> 08:55.845
...but sometimes when I'm bummed out,
I like to just close my eyes...

08:56.018 --> 08:58.612
...and think about
what a wonderful gift life is.

09:06.762 --> 09:08.354
See?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.094
-What happened?
-A little of this, a little of that.

09:14.370 --> 09:15.997
I got myself a date tomorrow.

09:16.305 --> 09:20.264
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.

09:21.877 --> 09:22.866
Get out.

09:38.961 --> 09:39.950
What took so long?

09:40.229 --> 09:43.528
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

09:48.537 --> 09:50.732
So thanks for having me over.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.248
See you, man.

10:13.262 --> 10:15.059
What the hell was that?

10:15.665 --> 10:19.897
Probably some European
goodbye thing he picked up in London.

10:20.169 --> 10:21.727
That's not European.

10:22.571 --> 10:24.163
It felt French.

10:26.742 --> 10:30.405
Well, I guess it's time for me
to say goodbye too, mon frere.

10:32.114 --> 10:34.674
Come here and give me a little sugar.

10:40.856 --> 10:42.653
I really had a good time.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.257
Yeah, me too.

10:47.830 --> 10:48.888
I guess this is it.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.593
Unless you want to come inside?

10:56.172 --> 10:59.903
Wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.

11:02.345 --> 11:04.245
Okay. Just hold on a second.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.320
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.

11:13.522 --> 11:14.921
Doing her laundry.

11:15.524 --> 11:16.752
What's that?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.619
It came in the mail today.

11:20.963 --> 11:23.397
It's 72 long-stemmed red roses.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.534
One for each day
I've known and loved Emily...

11:26.736 --> 11:28.897
...cut up into mulch.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.635
Honey, that's awful.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.765
It's not so bad.

11:34.977 --> 11:37.411
Monica's going to make potpourri.

11:40.549 --> 11:44.883
I think I'm going to go
wander out in the rain for a while.

11:45.087 --> 11:46.111
It's not raining.

11:46.389 --> 11:48.880
I can't catch a break!

11:50.292 --> 11:53.557
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.

11:53.829 --> 11:56.889
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.258
All right?

12:02.071 --> 12:03.265
Hey, Dave.

12:04.106 --> 12:08.065
I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.299
Okay. Bye!

12:13.082 --> 12:14.572
Honey, listen.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.411
I know things seem so
bad...

12:18.621 --> 12:20.953
...and that they won't get any

12:21.457 --> 12:23.015
Could I talk to you?

12:24.460 --> 12:26.018
I dropped some socks.

12:35.704 --> 12:40.437
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?

12:40.676 --> 12:43.474
You did not drop any socks!

12:43.779 --> 12:45.974
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!

12:46.148 --> 12:47.137
You listen to me!

12:47.349 --> 12:51.285
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

12:51.487 --> 12:52.613
What are you doing?

12:52.822 --> 12:56.815
Well, ultimately I was trying,
you know, I wanted...

12:57.693 --> 13:00.287
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.

13:00.663 --> 13:03.655
What? You cannot tell him that!

13:03.899 --> 13:05.230
Why? Why not?

13:05.468 --> 13:07.527
People love to hear that!

13:08.437 --> 13:10.098
Come on, I love you.

13:10.272 --> 13:12.001
-Wasn't that nice?
-No.

13:12.174 --> 13:14.506
I make the decisions and I say no!

13:14.677 --> 13:18.272
You know what? No, you don't
make my decisions, because...

13:18.581 --> 13:19.946
...you're fired.

13:20.282 --> 13:21.943
You can't fire me.

13:22.218 --> 13:26.712
I make your decisions,
and I say I'm not fired! Ha!

13:28.958 --> 13:30.118
Well....

13:40.536 --> 13:41.867
Come on, let me in!

13:42.104 --> 13:43.594
Having some trouble?

13:44.807 --> 13:46.138
Rachel locked the door.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.367
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.

13:51.780 --> 13:55.045
Ross, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

13:55.217 --> 13:58.709
-I just need to
-Rachel, open this door!

13:58.888 --> 14:02.187
-What, is it locked?
-She's fine. Listen....

14:02.491 --> 14:05.016
Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!

14:05.194 --> 14:07.754
-You want me to get that?
-No. Just let her do her thing...

14:07.930 --> 14:11.457
...and we'll do our thing.
Because I really need to tell you

14:18.807 --> 14:19.899
Thank you.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.406
Rachel? Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

14:28.584 --> 14:29.812
We really need to talk.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.552
Well, then talk.

14:32.221 --> 14:33.813
Okay, I will.

14:36.825 --> 14:40.989
Remember that thing we just discussed
that you wanted to do?

14:41.430 --> 14:42.488
What thing?

14:46.101 --> 14:48.626
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.830
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

14:52.107 --> 14:55.167
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.

14:55.411 --> 14:58.403
And who knows who she might
end up hurting?

15:04.753 --> 15:08.120
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.

15:10.292 --> 15:11.589
I have to use the phone.

15:11.860 --> 15:15.762
I gotta cancel those five giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.

15:16.031 --> 15:18.465
My God! Think of the massacre.

15:19.602 --> 15:20.762
I'm going to do it.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.800
I know you think I'm crazy.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.133
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...

15:26.342 --> 15:28.674
...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.

15:28.877 --> 15:29.969
Please?

15:32.214 --> 15:33.511
All right. Fine.

15:38.053 --> 15:39.953
Joey! I'm in!

15:40.189 --> 15:42.282
All right. Good deal.

15:49.565 --> 15:51.999
-Hi.
-Hey, Rach.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.692
-Did you find anyone who agrees with you?
-No.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.431
But you know what?
I think I need a male point of view.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.065
Joey.

16:03.012 --> 16:06.413
-You're a man.
-You got that right.

16:06.849 --> 16:10.751
Do you think it would be a good idea
if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?

16:10.919 --> 16:12.045
Nope.

16:14.523 --> 16:17.117
-Phoebe!
-Hey, Phoebe.

16:20.996 --> 16:22.623
-Phoebe?
-Yeah.

16:22.798 --> 16:26.290
You know how you were saying
you didn't get to go to London...

16:26.535 --> 16:28.366
...and you were feeling left out?

16:28.570 --> 16:31.403
Well, we all felt really bad
about that...

16:31.707 --> 16:35.074
...so we decided to
take a little trip together!

16:35.511 --> 16:37.479
Oh, that's so nice!

16:37.746 --> 16:39.509
How great!
Where's the trip?

16:40.049 --> 16:43.246
Well, we thought we would all
go to a picnic...

16:44.219 --> 16:45.584
...in Central Park!

16:45.821 --> 16:47.345
Central Park?

16:48.157 --> 16:49.715
All of us. All day.

16:50.325 --> 16:51.349
That sucks!

16:52.728 --> 16:54.992
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.

16:55.330 --> 16:58.197
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?

16:58.500 --> 17:01.367
It's right by my house.
All right!

17:03.205 --> 17:07.164
I'm going home to bask in the
triumph of my Central Park idea.

17:08.343 --> 17:10.402
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

17:12.214 --> 17:13.943
I wanted to talk to you about...

17:14.183 --> 17:17.380
...this whole new European thing
you've got going on.

17:17.586 --> 17:20.714
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...

17:20.956 --> 17:23.424
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

17:24.693 --> 17:27.127
Just bringing some culture
to the group.

17:27.529 --> 17:30.259
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.763
It makes me want to puke.

17:39.775 --> 17:42.107
Hey, everybody!
Phoebe is here!

17:44.646 --> 17:47.206
-Phoebe! Woo!
-Okay. Woo! Hi!

17:48.383 --> 17:52.149
Phoebe, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little....

17:52.387 --> 17:54.753
It didn't have any....
Well, it blew.

17:57.226 --> 18:01.720
We thought that this afternoon we'd
all go away for the whole weekend...

18:01.930 --> 18:03.261
...to Atlantic City.

18:03.465 --> 18:07.902
Atlantic City! Oh, that's
a great plan! Whose plan was that?

18:08.070 --> 18:09.059
Mine!

18:10.072 --> 18:13.064
-Wait. It was my plan.
-No...

18:13.308 --> 18:15.640
...I said we needed a new plan.

18:15.911 --> 18:17.902
And I came up with Atlantic City.

18:18.113 --> 18:20.138
Which is the new plan.

18:23.152 --> 18:25.620
Why don't we all
meet upstairs in an hour.

18:27.422 --> 18:30.914
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.

18:32.728 --> 18:37.028
Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee
because my ass is already packed.

18:41.103 --> 18:42.092
Let's go.

18:42.337 --> 18:44.828
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.003
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
so you can't tell him.

18:49.278 --> 18:51.371
You know what?
That doesn't matter.

18:52.514 --> 18:56.280
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...

18:56.518 --> 18:58.315
...and not have them say it back?

19:00.289 --> 19:02.120
I don't care.

19:05.961 --> 19:07.656
I can't watch.

19:22.544 --> 19:23.977
What you reading?

19:25.380 --> 19:26.369
Paper.

19:26.548 --> 19:28.345
Yeah? What's it about?

19:30.319 --> 19:33.015
Events from around the globe.

19:38.227 --> 19:40.855
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

19:41.063 --> 19:42.724
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

19:42.998 --> 19:45.865
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.

19:46.501 --> 19:47.729
Once at work...

19:48.003 --> 19:50.597
...I thought carbon dating
is fossilized

19:50.873 --> 19:53.569
I'm really trying to tell
you something here.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.373
Go ahead.

19:58.881 --> 20:01.076
I think I'm just going to say it.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.749
I'm just going to say it.

20:11.727 --> 20:15.322
I'm still in love with you, Ross.

20:30.746 --> 20:33.647
I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.

20:39.388 --> 20:42.289
What? Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.

20:45.027 --> 20:47.222
I'm so dead serious!

20:47.829 --> 20:49.353
I'm totally serious!

20:49.564 --> 20:50.861
Why are you laughing?

20:53.535 --> 20:55.526
Because I just heard it!

20:55.804 --> 20:57.795
I heard it. And it's ridiculous!

20:58.040 --> 20:59.166
I mean....

20:59.474 --> 21:00.634
You're married!

21:00.976 --> 21:03.342
You're married,
and it's just ridiculous!

21:03.578 --> 21:07.070
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.

21:07.349 --> 21:12.082
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel....

21:14.856 --> 21:18.223
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

21:22.331 --> 21:24.856
-Well, I am married.
-I know.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.660
Though I haven't spoken to her
since the wedding.

21:32.174 --> 21:34.369
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

21:35.777 --> 21:38.837
Actually, it kind of is.

21:41.516 --> 21:43.609
My wife won't return my calls.

21:46.955 --> 21:49.185
I don't know where my wife is.

21:52.461 --> 21:55.624
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"

21:57.933 --> 21:59.264
Oh, God!

22:02.738 --> 22:06.401
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?

22:08.610 --> 22:10.134
Well, I kind of have to.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.209
Because the thing is

22:12.414 --> 22:16.145
The thing is, you know,
that you're married to Emily.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.888
That is what the thing is.

22:25.327 --> 22:26.760
Oh, God.

22:27.596 --> 22:31.930
Things won't be weird between us,
right? Was that stupid?

22:32.167 --> 22:33.498
Me telling you that?

22:34.069 --> 22:35.900
I'm glad you did.

22:37.672 --> 22:39.230
If nothing else...

22:39.474 --> 22:42.671
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.

22:43.645 --> 22:45.135
That's what I said!

22:47.749 --> 22:51.515
-Thank you for being so nice.
-No. Thank you for....

22:52.821 --> 22:54.186
Thank you.

22:54.890 --> 23:00.419
Oh, God. I'm just glad I didn't give you
the cassette I made of all of our songs.

23:00.595 --> 23:02.893
-What songs?
-Oh, you know:

23:03.065 --> 23:05.863
-"With or Without You."
-Oh, yeah.

23:06.034 --> 23:08.366
-"Everybody Hurts."
-Oh, yeah.

23:08.537 --> 23:11.131
-"Rhiannon."
-Why "Rhiannon"?

23:11.306 --> 23:15.265
Come on, you remember!
In the living room?

23:15.744 --> 23:18.372
On Monica's laundry?

23:20.082 --> 23:21.777
Not me.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.779
Really.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.020
So, what happened?

23:32.194 --> 23:34.389
Well, it was really hard...

23:34.563 --> 23:37.123
...but I'm glad I did it.

23:37.299 --> 23:38.994
So was I right or wrong?

23:39.167 --> 23:43.570
-Oh, come on, honey, does it really matter?
-No.

23:43.738 --> 23:46.571
Yes. I need it for my score book.

23:46.741 --> 23:48.504
Diary.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.578
-Okay, let's go!
-Yeah, Atlantic City!

23:52.747 --> 23:54.180
Come on!

23:54.349 --> 23:56.340
Atlantic City, baby!

23:57.652 --> 23:59.347
Let's roll some bones.
Hey, Joey!

23:59.521 --> 24:01.148
High-five for rolling bones.

24:06.595 --> 24:08.119
Phoebe, you're leaking.

24:08.296 --> 24:10.287
Oh, my God! Your water broke!

24:10.499 --> 24:12.467
Oh, okay.

24:12.934 --> 24:15.164
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

24:16.638 --> 24:19.573
Phoebe, we have to take you
to the hospital now.

24:19.741 --> 24:23.040
Okay. Well, there's probably
one on the way to Atlantic City.

24:23.211 --> 24:26.408
Phoebe, the babies are coming now.

24:26.581 --> 24:29.141
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!

24:31.219 --> 24:33.084
Remember when my water broke?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.521
I can't believe Phoebe's going
to have her babies!

24:40.695 --> 24:43.027
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.

24:50.105 --> 24:54.235
I can't believe I had to kiss Phoebe
and Rachel every time I left the room.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.640
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.

24:58.113 --> 25:00.274
Do you know anything about women?

25:02.817 --> 25:04.444
-It's all right.
-Okay.
