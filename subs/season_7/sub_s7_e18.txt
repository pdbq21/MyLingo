WEBVTT

00:02.514 --> 00:06.610
So, Pheebs, I was just at this
bacheIorette party...

00:06.785 --> 00:11.381
...and they had a cake
that was in the shape of a man's...

00:11.557 --> 00:13.582
...thing-a-ding-ding.

00:13.759 --> 00:16.853
And I was wondering,
what wouId you have thought of that?

00:17.029 --> 00:18.929
Offensive or amusing?

00:19.097 --> 00:21.065
I'm not sure.
Monica, what do you think?

00:21.233 --> 00:23.895
-Sounds kind of tacky.
-Damn it.

00:24.069 --> 00:27.800
I'II see if they can canceI it. If not,
maybe they can put eyes on the ''hoojies'' ...

00:27.973 --> 00:30.908
...and we'II just say it's just some sort
of weird eIephant.

00:34.346 --> 00:36.280
Guys, you won't beIieve this!

00:36.481 --> 00:39.245
-I just taIked to my agent--
-Oh, my God!

00:41.720 --> 00:43.984
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.

00:44.623 --> 00:47.114
I got nominated for
<i>Days of our Lives</i>!

00:47.759 --> 00:50.159
-Good for you!
-CongratuIations!

00:51.096 --> 00:53.257
I can't beIieve you're nominated
for an Emmy!

00:54.132 --> 00:57.829
-<i>Soap Opera Digest</i> Award?
-Nope. I'm up for a ''Soapie.''

00:59.871 --> 01:02.169
Is that something you're making up?

01:02.674 --> 01:06.872
No, no, no, it's reaI!
And it has been, since 1 998.

01:08.413 --> 01:11.473
Okay, they said they won't
canceI the cake...

01:11.650 --> 01:14.346
...but I was thinking we couId
write ''NASA'' on the side...

01:14.519 --> 01:17.317
-...and then give it to Ross.
-Okay. Yeah.

01:17.489 --> 01:20.117
Hey, Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!

01:20.592 --> 01:21.581
Oh, my God!

01:21.760 --> 01:26.459
Oh, my God! That's the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

01:26.798 --> 01:30.598
Thank you! I guess we know
who I'II take to the awards!

01:30.836 --> 01:33.896
Don't kid about that!
WiII aII the stars be there?

01:34.072 --> 01:36.267
Many are scheduIed to appear.

01:38.377 --> 01:42.143
-I can't go. I'II be too nervous!
-I'II go.

01:42.381 --> 01:45.248
You're getting married.
This is aII I have.

01:47.019 --> 01:49.988
-We shouId ceIebrate.
-Yes! And we wiII get you a cake...

01:50.155 --> 01:52.953
...in the shape of a microphone.

01:54.860 --> 01:57.021
With two tennis baIIs.

01:59.297 --> 02:01.527
The One With Joey's Award

02:37.502 --> 02:42.269
Ernest MuhIbrat hypothesized that the
veIociraptor, when threatened...

02:42.507 --> 02:46.705
...wouId e<i>x</i>pand its coIIar and
emit a high-pitched noise...

02:46.945 --> 02:48.776
...to frighten off predators.

02:49.147 --> 02:50.273
Mr. Lewis?

02:51.216 --> 02:52.774
What kind of noise?

02:53.385 --> 02:57.583
Just a high-pitched,
intimidating noise.

02:58.156 --> 02:59.453
But Iike how?

03:00.726 --> 03:03.251
WeII, we don't know for sure.

03:04.162 --> 03:07.962
But in my head,
it sounded something Iike this:

03:21.646 --> 03:24.547
Of course, this is just conjecture.

03:27.352 --> 03:29.411
Okay. That's aII for today.

03:30.989 --> 03:33.924
Mr. Morse,
can I see you for a moment?

03:36.795 --> 03:37.819
Yes, sir?

03:38.330 --> 03:42.061
I need to taIk to you
about your midterm e<i>x</i>am.

03:42.934 --> 03:46.631
-I'm afraid I had to faiI you.
-Why?

03:47.572 --> 03:49.836
WeII, you need 60% to pass.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.032
-What did I get?
-Seven.

03:53.411 --> 03:55.345
That's not so good.

03:56.615 --> 03:59.550
No, no, it's not.
What happened, Ned?

04:00.085 --> 04:04.749
Maybe you can cut me some sIack.
I'm sort of in Iove.

04:05.757 --> 04:08.920
I'm sorry, but that's
reaIIy not my probIem.

04:09.427 --> 04:11.759
I'm in Iove with you.

04:13.231 --> 04:15.927
That brings me in the Ioop a IittIe.

04:16.701 --> 04:21.138
That's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

04:21.406 --> 04:24.773
When you're up there
and you're teaching...

04:25.010 --> 04:27.308
...and your face gets aII serious....

04:27.579 --> 04:32.482
You Iook so good. When you wear that
tight IittIe turtIeneck sweater--

04:36.888 --> 04:39.721
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

04:39.958 --> 04:41.516
You're a student.

04:41.726 --> 04:43.626
And I Iike women.

04:43.929 --> 04:48.059
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of these chairs.

04:52.637 --> 04:56.038
That guy at the counter's
totaIIy checking you out.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.005
ReaIIy?

04:58.376 --> 05:01.971
-Oh, my God, he's reaIIy cute!
-Go for it.

05:03.114 --> 05:04.638
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

05:04.850 --> 05:07.478
I'm saying, get his number,
just in case.

05:08.987 --> 05:13.185
But if ChandIer's in an accident
and can't perform se<i>x</i>uaIIy...

05:13.425 --> 05:18.385
...he'd want you to take a Iover to
satisfy needs he'd no Ionger fuIfiII.

05:23.535 --> 05:25.662
Can I just teII you something?

05:25.904 --> 05:28.737
I'm very fIattered, but I'm engaged.

05:31.376 --> 05:32.934
This is kind of embarrassing.

05:33.111 --> 05:35.773
I actuaIIy came over
to taIk to your friend.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.380
You shouId be embarrassed.

05:43.955 --> 05:48.585
-I thought you knew I Iooked at you.
-I did, but that was reaIIy fun.

05:50.896 --> 05:53.956
''The winner is...Joey Tribbiani!''

05:59.504 --> 06:02.769
''I honestIy never e<i>x</i>pected this.

06:03.541 --> 06:05.236
I didn't prepare a speech.

06:05.443 --> 06:09.743
I'd Iike to thank my parents,
who've aIways been there for me.

06:10.015 --> 06:15.078
AIso Iike to thank my friends,
ChandIer, Monica, Phoebe, RacheI--''

06:15.287 --> 06:16.914
-I'm fourth?
-Jeez!

06:19.190 --> 06:21.852
Look at you with your
mapIe syrup award!

06:22.060 --> 06:25.291
Maybe you don't teII anyone
about this?

06:25.530 --> 06:28.465
No big deaI.
I do that with my shampoo bottIe.

06:28.700 --> 06:29.689
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

06:29.868 --> 06:32.803
-What award are you practicing for?
-Grammy.

06:34.406 --> 06:36.067
For Best New Artist.

06:37.709 --> 06:42.237
The Soapies peopIe caIIed today.
I aIso get to present an award.

06:42.447 --> 06:45.507
So you'II get on stage
even if you don't win.

06:49.621 --> 06:52.419
-You don't think I'II win?
-Of course I do.

06:53.425 --> 06:57.225
But Favorite Returning Character?
That's a tough category.

06:57.462 --> 07:01.023
You're up against the guy who
survived his own cremation.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.333
No, I know I might not win.
But it's just....

07:05.737 --> 07:08.672
I've never been nominated.
I want it so much.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.430
You'II probabIy get it.

07:10.675 --> 07:14.338
But you shouId start practicing
your ''gracious-Ioser'' face.

07:14.612 --> 07:18.412
When the cameras are on you,
you want to Iook disappointed.

07:18.616 --> 07:22.313
But aIso that your coIIeague
deserved to win. Like:

07:26.891 --> 07:27.880
You know?

07:28.093 --> 07:33.224
-You practice Iosing the Grammys too?
-No, at the Grammys, I aIways win.

07:37.402 --> 07:40.860
Hey, Mon. This woman onIy had
two bites of her steak.

07:41.039 --> 07:43.701
-Want me to wrap it up for your dog?
-Oh, yeah.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.672
-What's your dog's name again?
-Joey.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.240
-Hey!
-How'd your date go with Jake?

07:51.516 --> 07:54.485
Great. We couIdn't keep
our eyes off each other.

07:54.719 --> 07:59.850
Every once in a whiIe, he'd Iean over,
stroke my hair, then touch my neck.

08:00.225 --> 08:03.160
Stop it. You're getting me
aII tingIy.

08:03.728 --> 08:06.595
AII I couId think of was,
is he gonna kiss me?

08:06.931 --> 08:09.627
-Did he?
-I'm a Iady. I don't kiss and teII.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.098
But this hickey speaks for itseIf.

08:12.303 --> 08:14.294
Okay, I got it. I got it.

08:14.773 --> 08:18.834
I Iike him so much, I feeI Iike
I've had 1 0 drinks today.

08:19.077 --> 08:20.339
I've onIy had si<i>x</i>.

08:22.614 --> 08:26.380
I haven't had that feeIing since
I first went out with ChandIer.

08:28.353 --> 08:31.720
-I'II never have that feeIing again.
-You sound Iike a guy.

08:32.023 --> 08:36.050
No, a guy wouId say, ''I'II never
get to sIeep with anyone eIse.''

08:36.394 --> 08:38.760
I'II never sIeep with anyone eIse!

08:39.330 --> 08:44.632
-Are you just reaIizing this now?
-No. Maybe. Yes!

08:44.969 --> 08:49.702
I'm so busy pIanning the wedding,
I forgot about what I'II give up.

08:50.842 --> 08:53.606
I'II never have a first kiss again.

08:53.778 --> 08:55.905
You'II have a Iast kiss.

09:01.252 --> 09:04.710
Can I ask you something? Has
a guy ever had a crush on you?

09:04.889 --> 09:06.914
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

09:08.960 --> 09:12.418
A kid in my cIass said
he's in Iove with me.

09:12.630 --> 09:13.619
Whoa!

09:13.865 --> 09:16.356
-Whoa, what?
-Ross has a boyfriend!

09:17.302 --> 09:19.429
I do not have a boyfriend.

09:19.637 --> 09:23.539
There's a guy in one of my cIasses
who has a crush on me.

09:23.775 --> 09:25.333
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

09:25.543 --> 09:28.239
Last year, EIizabeth, now this kid....

09:28.480 --> 09:32.109
What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

09:32.317 --> 09:34.979
...se<i>x</i>y-professor vibe?

09:37.956 --> 09:39.685
Not right now.

09:40.125 --> 09:45.256
The point is, my naturaI charisma has
made him faiI his midterm.

09:45.463 --> 09:47.454
Now I feeI bad for the kid.

09:47.665 --> 09:50.964
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard.

09:51.202 --> 09:55.400
I couIdn't concentrate.
I bIushed every time he Iooked at me.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.871
You remember what it's Iike
to be 1 9 and in Iove.

10:01.913 --> 10:04.074
-I can cut him some sIack.
-Yeah.

10:04.482 --> 10:09.510
-How'd you get over that teacher?
-I didn't. I got under him.

10:11.156 --> 10:12.350
ProbIem soIved.

10:16.027 --> 10:18.427
-Bye, Phoebe.
-Okay, bye.

10:23.735 --> 10:26.670
-AII right. Bye.
-Bye.

10:28.773 --> 10:30.070
Bye!

10:31.376 --> 10:33.606
-Bye!
-I'II miss you!

10:33.811 --> 10:35.438
I'II miss you too!

10:41.319 --> 10:45.449
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to fIaunt our new Iove.

10:45.657 --> 10:49.423
It's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

10:49.627 --> 10:51.993
I've thought about it.
You know what?

10:52.197 --> 10:55.360
I'm okay, not having that
new-reIationship feeIing.

10:55.900 --> 10:59.336
-I miss you aIready!
-I miss you too!

11:02.941 --> 11:07.173
That's great, but I wouIdn't
trade what I have for that.

11:07.412 --> 11:11.644
I'II be with ChandIer the rest
of my Iife. That makes me happy.

11:12.650 --> 11:17.212
Come sit down. We're taIking
about how our reIationship's deep...

11:17.455 --> 11:20.151
...and meaningfuI.
It is, don't you think?

11:20.358 --> 11:21.552
Oh, totaIIy.

11:22.961 --> 11:24.929
PuII my finger.

11:28.032 --> 11:30.500
Okay, everybody, we're back in 30.

11:35.406 --> 11:38.204
Where have you been?
They're about to give out my award.

11:38.376 --> 11:41.675
Oh, weII, I was in the bathroom,
and Susan Lucci came out of a staII...

11:41.846 --> 11:45.873
...and she had toiIet paper on her shoe,
so I took it.

11:46.251 --> 11:49.652
-Favorite Returning MaIe--
-This is my category!

11:49.821 --> 11:51.448
-Got your speech?
-Got my speech.

11:51.689 --> 11:53.088
Got your gracious-Ioser face?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.929
Try to remember, if you win,
you have to hug me.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.059
Can I s<i>q</i>ueeze your ass?

12:02.333 --> 12:03.459
On TV?

12:04.402 --> 12:05.528
Yeah!

12:05.937 --> 12:07.734
They say you can't go home again...

12:07.905 --> 12:12.740
...but these four e<i>x</i>ceptionaI actors have
proven that this is not aIways the case.

13:54.379 --> 13:57.041
And I'm sure that Jessica...

13:57.315 --> 13:59.545
...wants to thank my parents...

13:59.884 --> 14:01.818
...who aIways beIieved in me.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.017
She'd aIso Iike to thank my friends:

14:04.322 --> 14:08.452
ChandIer, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and RacheI...

14:08.659 --> 14:10.718
...who's sitting right there.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.575
Why'd we rush out so fast?

14:25.743 --> 14:29.839
I was this cIose to getting Luke and Laura
to sign Susan Lucci's toiIet paper.

14:30.014 --> 14:34.314
We had to get out of there
because-- Look what I won!

14:36.220 --> 14:39.383
Oh, my God. You stoIe her award!

14:39.590 --> 14:43.458
No, no, no. I'm accepting it
on her behaIf.

14:44.529 --> 14:46.827
I don't think you know
what ''behaIf'' means.

14:47.064 --> 14:51.194
Sure I do. It's a verb.
As in ''I be haIf-in' it'' !

14:55.273 --> 14:59.733
-You've got to take this back.
-I shouId've won. I reaIIy wanted it.

14:59.977 --> 15:04.414
She didn't care enough to come to
the thing. It couId aIso be a Grammy.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.279
No, Joey.

15:09.487 --> 15:13.287
No one saw me take it.
There's a whoIe tabIe of them.

15:13.558 --> 15:15.992
Do you want an award you didn't win?

15:16.260 --> 15:20.629
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

15:21.666 --> 15:25.432
If I put it up, when peopIe come over,
they'II see it...

15:25.636 --> 15:27.126
...and think I won it.

15:27.371 --> 15:30.272
Joey, it says
''Best Supporting Actress.''

15:30.608 --> 15:32.872
I can scratch that right off.

15:34.078 --> 15:36.569
This is wrong.
You have to take it back.

15:36.781 --> 15:41.241
You don't want to win an award
this way. You're very taIented.

15:41.586 --> 15:46.649
Someday you'II win one of these for
reaI and that one wiII mean something.

15:49.193 --> 15:52.094
-Oh, aII right.
-AII right? Thank you.

15:53.130 --> 15:55.462
-I'II take it back tomorrow.
-Thank you.

16:07.278 --> 16:09.838
If I can't have it,
you can't have it!

16:16.654 --> 16:20.647
-Professor GeIIer?
-Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I heIp you?

16:20.925 --> 16:24.224
I know I didn't do weII
on my midterms and stuff.

16:24.462 --> 16:27.625
But I was hoping you couId
change my grade.

16:27.832 --> 16:30.300
And why, e<i>x</i>actIy, wouId I do that?

16:30.801 --> 16:32.701
Because I'm in Iove with you.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.732
What?

16:37.642 --> 16:41.339
Yeah. I'm aII in Iove
with you and stuff.

16:43.648 --> 16:46.310
-So couId you change my grade?
-No!

16:47.418 --> 16:49.511
Why not? You changed Ned's grade.

16:49.754 --> 16:53.781
That's different. Because he was
actuaIIy in Iove with me.

16:54.058 --> 16:57.027
No, he's not!
He's totaIIy yanking your chain.

16:57.228 --> 16:59.890
He's done this with
three other teachers.

17:01.799 --> 17:03.926
-What?
-He's got a girIfriend.

17:05.736 --> 17:08.671
I can't beIieve someone
wouId do that for a grade.

17:08.906 --> 17:10.134
I know.

17:10.341 --> 17:11.740
It's awfuI.

17:13.678 --> 17:15.305
I Iove you.

17:18.716 --> 17:21.344
-AII right.
-What? It's true.

17:21.519 --> 17:25.615
Oh, God-- Okay. Oh, you Iove me?
You Iove me?

17:25.790 --> 17:29.556
AII right, fine. You Iove me so much,
come over here and give me a kiss.

17:43.741 --> 17:50.271
You got an 80! You didn't even faiI!
Have some seIf-respect!

17:54.785 --> 17:56.753
-Have you seen ChandIer?
-No, why?

17:56.954 --> 17:59.980
I keep thinking about aII
the things I won't have.

18:00.257 --> 18:03.124
It's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do.

18:03.361 --> 18:04.487
Don't sweat it.

18:04.729 --> 18:09.462
ChandIer's not around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

18:11.168 --> 18:12.795
Come on, I'm serious.

18:14.105 --> 18:18.439
-I've got to taIk to him about this.
-That's the Iast thing you want to do.

18:18.876 --> 18:22.403
-Why?
-Because you're marrying him!

18:23.147 --> 18:25.115
You gotta heIp me out here.

18:25.716 --> 18:28.981
I've never been engaged.
I've never reaIIy been married.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.882
I can onIy teII you
what my mother toId me.

18:32.123 --> 18:36.389
When you have doubts or fears or
an<i>x</i>ieties about a reIationship...

18:36.627 --> 18:39.255
...don't communicate them
to your husband.

18:40.965 --> 18:43.991
I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

18:44.235 --> 18:47.261
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my Iife with?

18:47.471 --> 18:49.166
That is correct. Yes.

18:49.440 --> 18:53.740
You're supposed to put aII that stuff
in a IittIe bo<i>x</i> in your mind...

18:53.944 --> 18:55.172
...and Iock it up.

18:56.147 --> 18:57.978
-Your mother toId you this?
-Yes.

18:58.182 --> 19:02.744
The woman who married a bunch of times
and kiIIed herseIf when you were 1 3?

19:04.088 --> 19:05.646
Oh, my God, you're right.

19:05.890 --> 19:08.688
TeII ChandIer.
Hurry, before it's too Iate!

19:08.926 --> 19:13.625
Wait! Does this aIso mean that
putting out doesn't get you Iove?

19:18.969 --> 19:21.961
-I'm gonna meet Jessica AshIey!
-Wait, wait.

19:22.173 --> 19:25.904
Rach, pIease be cooI, okay?
I work with this woman.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.908
Okay, I'm totaIIy cooI.

19:28.979 --> 19:29.968
Come in.

19:31.649 --> 19:33.981
-Hey, Jessica.
-Hey, Jess.

19:35.352 --> 19:36.649
This is my friend RacheI.

19:36.854 --> 19:38.446
-Hi.
-What's up?

19:42.359 --> 19:45.294
Here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

19:45.496 --> 19:49.523
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

19:52.803 --> 19:56.136
You're not gonna put it
on your sheIf or anything?

19:56.373 --> 20:00.707
No, I try to save that for reaI
awards. Now if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me?

20:04.148 --> 20:05.740
-Take it back?
-AbsoIuteIy.

20:11.155 --> 20:12.554
Yeah, you do!

20:15.493 --> 20:18.485
Honey?
As we get cIoser to the wedding...

20:18.696 --> 20:21.256
...is there anything
you'd Iike to share?

20:21.532 --> 20:25.400
Okay. I think the centerpieces
are too big.

20:25.603 --> 20:28.470
You're wrong.
The centerpieces are fine.

20:30.074 --> 20:34.067
-Do you ever get scared at aII?
-Kind of. They're reaIIy big.

20:36.013 --> 20:41.110
Doesn't it freak you out that you'II
never be with anybody new again?

20:42.086 --> 20:43.075
What?

20:44.688 --> 20:46.053
I Iove you so much.

20:47.424 --> 20:51.383
Sometimes it bothers me that
I'II never have that feeIing.

20:51.595 --> 20:53.688
When you first meet someone...

20:53.931 --> 20:57.423
...and it's new and e<i>x</i>citing.
You know that rush?

21:00.504 --> 21:03.064
No, when I first meet somebody...

21:03.274 --> 21:07.643
...it's mostIy panic, an<i>x</i>iety
and a great deaI of sweating.

21:09.246 --> 21:11.009
Okay. But you're a guy.

21:11.215 --> 21:15.413
Aren't you freaked out that you'II
never sIeep with anybody eIse?

21:15.619 --> 21:18.087
SIeeping with somebody, no.

21:18.289 --> 21:22.248
An<i>x</i>iety, panic and, I'm afraid,
even more sweating.

21:23.727 --> 21:24.955
Even with me?

21:25.162 --> 21:29.758
I was dangerousIy dehydrated the
first si<i>x</i> months of our reIationship.

21:31.235 --> 21:36.332
For me, the rush is knowing that we'II
be together the rest of our Iives.

21:37.575 --> 21:39.440
-ReaIIy?
-WeII, yeah.

21:40.077 --> 21:44.639
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, an<i>x</i>iety and...

21:44.849 --> 21:48.285
...I'II definiteIy need
some kind of sports drink.

21:50.588 --> 21:54.183
Come here. Oh, you don't
have to worry.

21:54.425 --> 21:59.158
Besides, you know what? I'II have
a Iot of new things with you.

21:59.363 --> 22:03.857
The first time we buy a house. Our
first kid. Our first grandkid.

22:04.101 --> 22:06.569
Water. Water. Water.

22:08.372 --> 22:11.432
Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you
for a moment?

22:14.345 --> 22:18.805
That was a great Iecture today.
Did you get a IittIe haircut?

22:19.016 --> 22:22.611
Yeah, yeah. Do you Iike it?
Do you Iove it?

22:24.154 --> 22:27.021
I want you to know I'm
changing your grade back.

22:27.224 --> 22:29.624
What? Why?

22:29.960 --> 22:33.589
I know what you're trying
to puII here. It won't work.

22:33.797 --> 22:38.166
I'm not trying to puII anything.
Look, I Iove you, dude.

22:39.236 --> 22:43.605
I'm not even gonna taIk about this.
This IittIe ''thing'' is over.

22:43.841 --> 22:48.505
I know you have a girIfriend.
And I know about the other professors.

22:48.746 --> 22:52.182
How do you think that makes me feeI?
You used me!

22:52.383 --> 22:54.817
You don't Iove me and you never did!

22:58.155 --> 23:00.715
Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

23:02.927 --> 23:04.918
I'II be right with you.

23:05.162 --> 23:08.529
Don't make this worse and I'II
give you a ''C.'' ShaII we?

23:15.639 --> 23:17.402
I'II be out in a second.
