WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:06.035
- That girl totally winked at me! <br/>- She did not wink at you.

00:06.239 --> 00:08.673
You always think somebody's <br/>winking at you.

00:24.958 --> 00:29.827
The One With the <br/>Princess Leia Fantasy

01:10.437 --> 01:12.769
I have to say "Tupelo Honey" <br/>by Van Morrison.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.371
No way!

01:14.574 --> 01:17.543
The most romantic song ever was <br/>"The Way We Were."

01:17.744 --> 01:22.613
I think the one that Elton John wrote <br/>for that guy on Who's the Boss?

01:24.584 --> 01:25.915
What song was that, Pheebs?

01:26.686 --> 01:29.985
<i>Hold me close <br/>Young Tony Danza</i>

01:34.861 --> 01:36.328
- Hi, Monica. <br/>- Hi, Mon.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.429
Hey, Mon.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.366
Oh, my God!

01:41.568 --> 01:43.399
- Has she slept at all? <br/>- No.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.562
- It's been three nights in a row. <br/>- She finally stopped crying yesterday.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.676
But then she found one of Richard's <br/>cigar butts on the terrace...

01:51.878 --> 01:55.473
Okay, that explains it. <br/>I got a call at 2 in the morning...

01:55.682 --> 01:58.742
...and all I could hear was <br/>this squeaky sound. So I thought:

01:58.952 --> 02:00.510
"It's, like, a mouse or a possum."

02:02.388 --> 02:04.515
Then I realized, like:

02:04.724 --> 02:09.752
"Okay, where would a mouse or a possum <br/>get the money to make the phone call?"

02:12.599 --> 02:14.226
- Morning. <br/>- Morning.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.768
You made pancakes?

02:17.770 --> 02:20.705
Yeah, like there's any way <br/>I could ever do that.

02:21.374 --> 02:24.343
<i>Monica and Rachel had syrup</i>

02:25.278 --> 02:27.769
<i>Now I can get my man to cheer up</i>

02:30.416 --> 02:33.180
- Good morning, Joey. <br/>- Good morning.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.549
Someone's wearing grumpy pants.

02:36.756 --> 02:39.850
It's gotta be you, man. <br/>I'm wearing smarty-pants.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.892
Okay, here we go: One, two...

02:43.096 --> 02:48.295
...and here's my chance <br/>to give you a third one.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.800
- Joey? <br/>- No, no. I'll just have juice.

02:53.072 --> 02:56.838
Why don't you stay home from work today <br/>and just hang out with me?

02:57.043 --> 02:58.101
Oh, I wish.

02:58.311 --> 03:02.042
You have that report to finish, <br/>and I've gotta go see my lawyer.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.910
I can't believe I date <br/>a girl who's getting divorced.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.052
I'm such a grownup.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.550
Joey! Hey!

03:08.755 --> 03:10.655
Go to your room!

03:11.157 --> 03:12.181
Chandler! Hey!

03:12.559 --> 03:14.220
Up yours!

03:14.961 --> 03:16.622
I gotta go, I gotta go.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.057
Not without a kiss.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.391
Maybe I won't kiss you <br/>so you'll stay.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.761
Kiss her. Kiss her!

03:24.771 --> 03:27.137
I'll see you later, sweetie. <br/>Bye, Joey.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.398
Bye-bye, Janice.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.135
So when are you dumping her?

03:33.346 --> 03:36.179
Nope. Not this time.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.247
Come on, quit yanking me.

03:41.821 --> 03:43.379
I'm not yanking you.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.118
- This is Janice. <br/>- Yeah, I know.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.760
She makes me happy.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.087
Okay. All right.

03:52.298 --> 03:55.859
You look me in the eye and tell me, <br/>without blinking...

03:56.069 --> 03:58.765
...that you're not breaking up <br/>with her. No blinking.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.333
I'm not breaking up with her!

04:12.018 --> 04:14.646
God, look what I found in the drain!

04:14.854 --> 04:16.014
What?

04:17.056 --> 04:21.186
It's some of Richard's hair! <br/>What do I do with this?

04:21.461 --> 04:24.589
Getting it away from me <br/>would be job one.

04:25.531 --> 04:28.762
It's weird, but I don't want <br/>to throw this away.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.027
I mean, this is all I have left of him.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.761
Gross...

04:33.473 --> 04:34.531
...drain hair.

04:40.947 --> 04:46.214
Cool! It looks like a tiny <br/>little person drowning in your cereal.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.484
God, what is wrong with me?

04:50.690 --> 04:54.717
- You need to get some sleep. <br/>- I need to get some Richard.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.126
You broke up with him for a reason.

04:59.332 --> 05:03.132
I know. I know. <br/>I'm just so tired of missing him.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.567
I'm tired of wondering why he <br/>hasn't called. Why hasn't he called?

05:06.773 --> 05:08.798
Maybe because you told him not to?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.110
What are you, the Memory Woman?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.006
They're not breaking up! <br/>Chandler and Janice?

05:16.215 --> 05:19.810
They're not breaking up! <br/>He didn't blink or anything!

05:20.019 --> 05:22.510
I'm not surprised. <br/>Have you seen them together?

05:22.722 --> 05:26.158
- They're really cute. <br/>- "Cute"? This is Janice!

05:27.293 --> 05:28.658
You remember Janice?

05:28.861 --> 05:31.386
Yes, I remember. She's annoying. <br/>But you know what?

05:31.597 --> 05:34.122
She's his girlfriend now. <br/>I mean, what can we do?

05:34.367 --> 05:38.804
There you go! That's the spirit <br/>I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

05:40.139 --> 05:42.573
All right, who's first, huh? Ross?

05:42.775 --> 05:45.642
I think Chandler's our friend, <br/>and Janice makes him happy.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.336
So I say we all be adult about it <br/>and accept her.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.642
We'll call that "Plan B," all right?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.213
Come on, people! <br/>We need some inspiration.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.753
Okay, all right. <br/>You want a plan? Here we go:

05:57.957 --> 06:02.860
So, Ross, you go in through the air <br/>duct and disable the alarm, okay?

06:03.062 --> 06:05.360
Then the rest of us <br/>will rappel down ropes.

06:05.565 --> 06:09.899
We're in and out in 10 minutes <br/>and disappear into the night. Huh?

06:31.758 --> 06:32.952
Honey...

06:33.159 --> 06:34.990
...I was wondering...

06:35.194 --> 06:39.563
Do you still have <br/>that Navy uniform?

06:40.933 --> 06:44.232
No, I had to return it <br/>to the costume place.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.873
I think I have an old band uniform <br/>from high school.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.975
You remember not having sex <br/>in high school, right?

06:56.282 --> 06:59.410
- Well, honey, what about you? <br/>- What?

07:00.319 --> 07:05.347
Do you have any fun, you know, <br/>fantasy-type things?

07:06.359 --> 07:07.986
No.

07:09.328 --> 07:11.057
Come on. You gotta have one.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.132
Nope.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.928
- Ross. You know what? <br/>- What?

07:16.135 --> 07:19.627
If you tell me, I might do it.

07:31.317 --> 07:35.151
Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?

07:44.197 --> 07:47.166
Do you remember the scene...

07:48.534 --> 07:50.900
...with Jabba the Hutt?

07:52.939 --> 07:57.137
He was this really fat worm guy.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.272
Wow. Men and women <br/>really are different.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.403
No. No. No.

08:02.615 --> 08:06.517
See, Jabba had as his prisoner...

08:06.719 --> 08:08.949
...Princess Leia.

08:12.058 --> 08:15.494
Princess Leia was wearing...

08:15.995 --> 08:18.520
...this gold bikini thing.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.992
It was pretty cool.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.164
So are you saying <br/>that you would like me...

08:30.076 --> 08:32.374
...to dress up like Princess Leia...

08:32.578 --> 08:33.806
...in a gold bikini?

08:34.180 --> 08:35.841
Okay.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.909
Princess Leia and the gold bikini? <br/>Every guy our age loved that.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.686
Really?

08:46.025 --> 08:49.791
It's huge! That's the moment <br/>when she stopped being a princess...

08:49.996 --> 08:52.692
...and she became, like, <br/>you know, a woman.

08:54.567 --> 08:59.163
- Did you ever do the Leia thing? <br/>- Oh, yeah.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.542
Really? That great, huh?

09:06.078 --> 09:10.572
No, it's just that I got this new pager <br/>and I have it on vibrate.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.244
See you.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.048
- Hey. <br/>- Hi, you guys!

09:18.257 --> 09:21.420
Look who I found standing <br/>outside the Szechuan Dragon...

09:21.627 --> 09:23.857
...staring at a parking meter.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.934
- Why aren't you at work? <br/>- Oh, they sent me home.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.605
Why?

09:33.806 --> 09:36.468
Because I don't work <br/>at the Szechuan Dragon.

09:36.709 --> 09:40.338
- You really need to get some sleep. <br/>- I know I do.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.050
- Guess what? They published my paper. <br/>- Really?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.583
"Statistical Deviations <br/>in the Carbon Dating...

09:47.787 --> 09:52.019
...of Fossilized Algae: <br/>History or Mystery?"

09:54.093 --> 09:55.685
Rach, look!

10:01.334 --> 10:05.270
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker <br/>to come rescue me?

10:10.409 --> 10:11.376
There he is!

10:17.016 --> 10:17.983
<i>- Wheel! <br/>- Of!</i>

10:18.184 --> 10:19.981
<i>Fortune!</i>

10:21.087 --> 10:22.315
This guy's so stupid.

10:22.521 --> 10:23.988
It's Count Rushmore!

10:28.260 --> 10:31.354
You know, you should <br/>really go on this show.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.593
Listen, I got three tickets <br/>to the Rangers tonight.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.860
- What do you say? <br/>- I say I am there!

10:38.070 --> 10:39.731
Cool!

10:40.272 --> 10:42.638
- Is Ross going too? <br/>- No. Janice.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.742
Janice?

10:45.878 --> 10:49.075
Because I just feel bad for Ross, <br/>you know?

10:49.281 --> 10:53.877
We always go together. We're, like, <br/>the Three Hockey-teers, you know?

10:54.453 --> 10:58.947
I may be way out on a limb here, <br/>but do you have a problem with Janice?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.648
No!

11:01.427 --> 11:02.553
Yes...

11:03.362 --> 11:06.024
Oh, God, how do I say this?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.530
You know that girl from <br/>the Greek restaurant with the hair?

11:12.738 --> 11:15.798
That girl that I hate? <br/>She drives me crazy.

11:17.476 --> 11:21.537
Look, I don't hate Janice. <br/>She's just a lot to take, you know?

11:24.150 --> 11:28.519
- Well, there you go. <br/>- Come on, don't look at me like that.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.019
She used to drive you nuts <br/>before too, remember?

11:31.223 --> 11:34.556
I'm crazy about her now. <br/>I think this could be the real thing.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.557
Capital R, capital T!

11:38.831 --> 11:41.629
Don't worry, <br/>those are the right letters.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.396
Look, what do you want me to say?

11:46.272 --> 11:48.763
- I want you to say that you like her! <br/>- I can't.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.272
- Like her! <br/>- No.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.104
So you're not even gonna try?

11:53.312 --> 11:56.509
What's the point? It's like <br/>this chemical thing, you know?

11:56.716 --> 11:59.708
Every time she starts laughing, <br/>I just wanna...

12:02.288 --> 12:05.416
...pull my arm off just so I have <br/>something to throw at her.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.785
Thanks for trying.

12:10.596 --> 12:14.498
Oh, and by the way, <br/>there is no Count Rushmore!

12:15.167 --> 12:18.933
Yeah? Then who's the guy that <br/>painted the faces on the mountain?

12:26.245 --> 12:28.008
How could you have told her?

12:28.214 --> 12:30.409
I didn't think it would be <br/>that big a deal!

12:30.616 --> 12:33.050
She didn't think it would be <br/>that big a deal!

12:33.252 --> 12:35.948
Who are you talking to <br/>when you do that?

12:36.222 --> 12:40.522
Look, that was supposed to be <br/>a private, personal thing between us.

12:40.726 --> 12:44.958
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay? <br/>We tell each other everything.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.155
I mean, come on! <br/>Guys do the same thing.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.130
What about all that locker-room stuff?

12:50.336 --> 12:53.271
That's different. <br/>That's like, who dated a stripper?

12:53.472 --> 12:56.771
Or who did it on the back <br/>of the Staten Island ferry?

12:57.743 --> 13:00.007
- Both of those Joey? <br/>- Yeah.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.677
But you don't talk <br/>about your girlfriend...

13:03.883 --> 13:06.818
...and the intimate stuff <br/>you do with her.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.950
- Not even with your best friend? <br/>- No.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.215
That is so sad.

13:12.691 --> 13:17.526
You're missing out on so much. <br/>I mean, the bonding and the sharing...

13:17.730 --> 13:22.963
...and knowing that someone else is <br/>going through the same thing you are.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.568
So, what, you tell each <br/>other everything?

13:27.473 --> 13:28.565
Pretty much.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.978
Did you talk <br/>about the night of five times?

13:38.217 --> 13:41.118
Do you tell people <br/>about the night of five times?

13:41.420 --> 13:43.581
Honey, that was with Carol.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.350
I know, but it's still worth <br/>mentioning, I think.

13:48.727 --> 13:52.720
Relax every muscle in your body.

13:53.999 --> 13:58.095
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.905
Okay, now close your eyes...

14:02.107 --> 14:05.167
...and think of a happy place.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.004
Tell me your happy place.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.641
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

14:09.849 --> 14:15.014
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing. <br/>Just put down the glass and get out.

14:15.754 --> 14:18.120
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

14:18.324 --> 14:23.125
Okay, fine. Use my happy place. <br/>Just don't move anything in there.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.723
I'll try not to.

14:25.931 --> 14:29.958
Okay. All right, so, <br/>you're in a meadow...

14:30.169 --> 14:32.865
...millions of stars in the sky...

14:33.072 --> 14:35.097
You think breaking up was a mistake?

14:35.307 --> 14:37.673
There are no questions <br/>in the happy place.

14:38.844 --> 14:41.540
Okay. Just the warm breeze...

14:41.747 --> 14:45.239
...and the moonlight flowing <br/>through the trees.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.783
I'll bet he's over me. <br/>I'll bet he's fine.

14:47.987 --> 14:53.084
Betting and wagering of any kind <br/>are not permitted in the happy place.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.955
There's just, you know, <br/>the lovely waterfalls...

14:57.162 --> 14:59.687
...and the trickling fountains...

14:59.899 --> 15:04.529
...and the calming sounds <br/>of the babbling brook.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.796
Okay, this isn't working.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.907
I'm still awake, <br/>and now I have to pee.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.905
Guess who!

15:23.489 --> 15:26.652
Janice. Hi. You just missed Chandler...

15:26.859 --> 15:29.828
...but won't you come in <br/>before you go?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.292
So I hear...

15:34.500 --> 15:35.797
...you hate me!

15:38.103 --> 15:41.470
I never said "hate." <br/>I was very careful about that.

15:41.674 --> 15:46.941
A little birdie told me you wanted <br/>to rip your arm off and throw it at me.

15:48.547 --> 15:52.881
And you got "hate" from that? <br/>You're taking a big leap there.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.643
All right, fine, fine, fine!

15:54.853 --> 15:58.653
We have got to do something <br/>about our little situation here.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.484
So this is my idea.

16:00.693 --> 16:04.527
You and me spending <br/>some quality time together.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.697
- But what does that...? <br/>- For Chandler!

16:10.469 --> 16:11.629
Okay. I'm in.

16:11.870 --> 16:16.569
Okay! This is what we'll call it: <br/>Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

16:18.711 --> 16:20.201
Does it have to be a whole day?

16:20.412 --> 16:24.644
Yes, because that's how long <br/>it takes to love me.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.753
Yeah, I know. <br/>I sleep in the next room.

16:34.259 --> 16:37.194
So do you guys all hate Janice too?

16:37.396 --> 16:41.264
You hate Janice now? <br/>Joey's gonna be so relieved.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.263
Oh, my God.

16:47.873 --> 16:50.239
Oh, my God.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.773
Well, look, everybody. It's Weepy:

16:54.113 --> 16:57.241
"The Mime that Cares Too Much."

16:57.883 --> 17:00.078
Then I went down <br/>to the post office...

17:00.285 --> 17:03.448
...and it turns out it was those videos <br/>that I ordered for Richard...

17:03.655 --> 17:05.885
...about the Civil War.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.388
He loved the Civil War.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.290
Monica, do you want us <br/>to take you home?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.303
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.945
Women tell each other everything! <br/>Did you know that?

17:33.352 --> 17:35.752
No, Chandler, everything.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.653
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

17:39.858 --> 17:43.055
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.157
Girth?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.761
Why? Why? Why? Why?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.730
Why would they do this?

17:51.937 --> 17:55.202
Rachel says sharing's great <br/>and supposedly...

17:55.407 --> 17:58.001
...you know, we ought to be doing it.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.307
Do you wanna?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.611
We're not gonna talk about girth, <br/>are we?

18:06.618 --> 18:07.812
- Okay. <br/>- Yeah?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.954
All right, you go first.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.885
Okay. Okay, I'll go first.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.322
So the other night...

18:15.527 --> 18:19.054
...Rachel and I are in bed <br/>talking about fantasies...

18:19.264 --> 18:23.223
...and I happened <br/>to describe a particular...

18:23.769 --> 18:25.202
...Star Wars thing...

18:25.404 --> 18:28.202
- Princess Leia and the gold bikini. <br/>- Yes!

18:28.407 --> 18:29.874
I know!

18:33.245 --> 18:34.735
Well, that was easy.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.211
- Okay, you go. <br/>- Okay.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.716
You know when you're in bed <br/>with a woman...

18:44.323 --> 18:45.756
...and fooling around...

18:45.958 --> 18:48.927
...and you get all these <br/>mental images in your brain?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.926
Like Elle MacPherson <br/>or the girl at the Xerox place?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.827
- With the bellybutton ring? <br/>- I know.

18:55.267 --> 18:59.101
And then all of a sudden, <br/>your mom pops into your head.

18:59.404 --> 19:03.135
And you're like, <br/>"Mom, get out of here!"

19:03.342 --> 19:06.175
But after that, <br/>you can't think of anything else.

19:06.378 --> 19:11.577
And you can't stop what you're doing. <br/>So it's kind of like you're...

19:11.783 --> 19:12.977
...you know...

19:13.185 --> 19:14.152
...you know...

19:14.553 --> 19:16.316
You don't know!

19:17.923 --> 19:19.515
Your mom?

19:19.925 --> 19:23.452
You're telling me about your mom? <br/>What is the matter with you?

19:24.429 --> 19:27.398
- You said... <br/>- I said "share," not "scare"!

19:27.733 --> 19:29.667
Go sit over there!

19:35.174 --> 19:37.165
We're back!

19:38.644 --> 19:40.475
What are you guys doing together?

19:40.679 --> 19:44.911
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

19:46.451 --> 19:47.748
Really?

19:47.986 --> 19:51.114
We went to a Mets game. <br/>We got Chinese food.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.951
And, you know, I love this woman.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.822
You have got competition, buddy.

19:58.797 --> 20:02.426
I just came by to give you a kiss.

20:03.202 --> 20:08.265
I have to go pick up the baby. <br/>So I'll see you later, sweetheart.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.667
You too, Chandler.

20:18.517 --> 20:24.080
- You still can't stand her, can you? <br/>- I'm sorry, man. I tried! I really did!

20:25.824 --> 20:27.917
I appreciate you giving it a shot.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.554
But, you know, the good thing...

20:30.762 --> 20:34.163
...is that we spent the whole day <br/>together and I survived.

20:34.366 --> 20:37.631
And what's even more amazing, <br/>so did she.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.565
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

20:41.873 --> 20:45.104
- I guess that's something. <br/>- Oh, man, that's huge!

20:45.310 --> 20:47.574
Now I know I can stand <br/>to be around her.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.612
Which means I get <br/>to hang out with you.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.444
Which is kind of <br/>the whole point anyway.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.751
Oh, hey! We stopped by <br/>the coffee shop and ran into Ross.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.625
Oh, God.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.428
If it makes you feel any better, <br/>I do it too.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.341
- Really? <br/>- Oh, yeah!

21:17.542 --> 21:20.943
I always picture your mom <br/>when I'm having sex.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.313
<i>April 12, 1861.</i>

21:31.423 --> 21:34.790
<i>The United States garrison <br/>at Fort Sumter was fired upon.</i>

21:35.527 --> 21:37.722
<i>It is now under bombardment by...</i>

21:49.041 --> 21:50.668
Dad! What are you doing here?

21:50.876 --> 21:55.506
It's your mother's bridge night, so I <br/>came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.585
Since when did you start <br/>smoking cigars?

22:02.654 --> 22:06.613
I don't. <br/>I just like the smell of them.

22:07.125 --> 22:10.253
So, what are you really doing here?

22:10.462 --> 22:13.363
I just wanted to make sure <br/>that you're okay.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.895
Why wouldn't I be okay?

22:16.134 --> 22:17.499
I saw Richard.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.569
So how you doing?

22:22.774 --> 22:24.139
I'm fine.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.744
I'm just a little tired, <br/>but I'm okay.

22:27.946 --> 22:30.608
- How's Richard doing? <br/>- You don't wanna know.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.580
No, I really, really do.

22:33.785 --> 22:36.049
Well, he's doing terrible!

22:38.357 --> 22:39.790
Really?

22:40.425 --> 22:42.757
Worse than when he broke up <br/>with Barbara.

22:43.995 --> 22:48.762
- You're not just saying that, are you? <br/>- No, the man is a mess!

22:49.468 --> 22:52.130
- Was he crying? <br/>- No.

22:52.337 --> 22:56.034
Do you think he was waiting till <br/>after you left, so he could cry?

22:56.241 --> 22:57.765
Maybe.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.868
I think so.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.412
Honey, relationships are hard. <br/>Like with your mom and me.

23:04.583 --> 23:08.349
You know, after we graduated <br/>from college, we broke up for a while.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.021
It seems her father, <br/>your grandfather...

23:11.223 --> 23:13.851
...wanted her to travel <br/>around Europe like he did.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.857
Of course, he got to do it <br/>on Uncle Sam's nickel...

23:17.062 --> 23:21.123
...because he was also strafing <br/>German troop trains at the time.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.322
However...

24:04.443 --> 24:06.104
Okay, here we go.

24:06.344 --> 24:09.245
I am Jabba's prisoner. <br/>And you...

24:10.148 --> 24:12.582
...have a really weird look <br/>on your face.

24:12.818 --> 24:16.117
What? Honey, what is it? <br/>Did I get the hair wrong?

24:16.321 --> 24:18.812
Did you just picture it differently? <br/>What?

24:19.024 --> 24:22.289
No, no. It's not you. <br/>It's...

24:27.299 --> 24:31.395
What is it? Come on, sweetie. <br/>You're, like, freaking me out here.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.667
I hate Chandler. <br/>The bastard ruined my life!
