WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:06.702
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

00:06.973 --> 00:08.998
I remember when people used big ones.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.700
That's a good story, Grandpa.

00:15.548 --> 00:19.541
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

00:19.819 --> 00:22.049
Did someone get her
drunk again, or...?

00:23.723 --> 00:26.817
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.957
It's about being with loved ones.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.686
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

00:33.833 --> 00:36.996
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.567
Oh, here.

00:42.909 --> 00:44.638
See, now it feels like Christmas.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.605
The One With The Routine

01:24.050 --> 01:26.541
And that's the story of the dreidel.

01:28.688 --> 01:32.556
Some people trace the Christmas tree
to the Egyptians...

01:32.759 --> 01:37.458
who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

01:37.764 --> 01:40.255
symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.434
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

01:43.703 --> 01:47.366
Around the same time
that you started this story.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.904
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. What's up?

01:53.146 --> 01:57.412
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.708
Everywhere I look she's like....

02:03.990 --> 02:06.550
I can see why that's hard to resist.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.061
I like her so much.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.092
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.060
I know. And she's so sweet.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.962
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.633
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

02:23.243 --> 02:26.235
I am so over Janine.

02:26.980 --> 02:31.940
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.917
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!

02:37.490 --> 02:40.584
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

02:40.793 --> 02:44.752
It's called some sort of
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.099
Hold it.

02:49.602 --> 02:53.094
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?

02:53.306 --> 02:55.171
Yeah, that's what I said.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.543
Oh, my God, we love that show!

03:00.813 --> 03:03.805
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.451
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

03:09.556 --> 03:12.184
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

03:12.525 --> 03:17.224
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

03:17.697 --> 03:21.064
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

03:21.301 --> 03:23.997
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.035
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why..

03:27.307 --> 03:28.706
Well, how it works is...

03:28.908 --> 03:32.708
the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.005
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.581
Not a lot of people know that.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.714
Do you guys want to come too?

03:42.488 --> 03:45.582
-Are you serious?
-We are there!

03:49.162 --> 03:50.754
What are you laughing at?

03:51.064 --> 03:54.932
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.430
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.607
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.200
Bye, Janine.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.205
Did she just ask me out on a date?

04:09.849 --> 04:12.079
I don't think so.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.719
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.515
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.922
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

04:22.128 --> 04:25.063
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.027
It's a New Year's Eve party.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.704
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.737
If she says, "What are you doing?"

04:34.974 --> 04:37.738
I can say, "lt wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

04:39.779 --> 04:42.475
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

04:42.715 --> 04:46.276
and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.453
It was a dry day.

04:53.826 --> 04:58.229
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!

04:58.431 --> 05:00.296
Oh, my God!

05:00.500 --> 05:02.559
Oh, my God!

05:03.069 --> 05:04.764
Oh, my God!

05:12.111 --> 05:14.136
Okay, I've been on sets before...

05:14.414 --> 05:16.109
so let me give you some advice.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.683
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.978
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.848
-Got it.
-Okay.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.188
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

05:29.529 --> 05:30.826
Everyone! Gather up!

05:31.698 --> 05:33.825
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!

05:34.967 --> 05:37.629
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

05:37.870 --> 05:40.964
we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

05:41.207 --> 05:44.870
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.871
Yeah. Now, you guys dance
over there...

05:49.182 --> 05:51.844
you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.313
Everyone else, spread out.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.421
We'd rather not dance together
because we're brother and sister.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.250
Yeah, it would seem kind of weird.

05:58.424 --> 06:03.589
As weird as coming all the way down here
and then having to go home right now?

06:05.898 --> 06:07.763
So when is it gonna air?

06:13.139 --> 06:15.437
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.973
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

06:19.679 --> 06:23.809
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.317
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.815
That's terrible.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.680
No, we do it every year.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.390
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.418
Yeah, we never find them.

06:36.662 --> 06:40.530
She's always bested us,
that wily...minx.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.358
We'll search here for an hour...

06:43.603 --> 06:46.265
and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

06:46.539 --> 06:49.872
-You can't look for Monica's presents.
-We have to.

06:50.076 --> 06:54.240
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.044
Well, then you should look with us.

06:58.785 --> 06:59.774
Why?

06:59.952 --> 07:02.580
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

07:02.855 --> 07:05.050
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.260
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

07:09.429 --> 07:12.057
What if she gets you
a great present...

07:12.298 --> 07:14.425
two mediums
and lots of little ones...

07:14.634 --> 07:17.797
and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.595
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

07:22.608 --> 07:24.735
-If I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!

07:27.413 --> 07:28.437
We have a live one!

07:28.648 --> 07:31.310
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.876
Who's it for?

07:36.622 --> 07:40.752
"Dear losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.794
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

07:48.134 --> 07:50.728
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.631
We are so gonna find them this year.

07:54.841 --> 07:58.641
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

07:58.845 --> 07:59.937
Yeah.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.841
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

08:03.115 --> 08:05.481
and look under my gym bag
or anything?

08:07.119 --> 08:08.677
-No. Never do that.
-No.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.954
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.756
Okay, that did not just happen.

08:27.940 --> 08:28.929
Here comes a camera.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.201
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.947
Why do they keep doing that?

08:44.190 --> 08:47.023
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.954
They've been taping them all day.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.354
Right.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.566
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

08:57.837 --> 08:59.361
We learned how to dance.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.400
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

09:04.644 --> 09:06.271
Yeah!

09:09.849 --> 09:12.818
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.213
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.150
-What do you mean?
-Like this.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.689
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.098
You're dancing with her.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.869
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.104
I don't see it.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.498
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall guy, raise your hand!

09:38.611 --> 09:43.241
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her, and I think I have a shot.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.609
Really, you think so? I don't.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.394
I couldn't find anything..
Hey, wait!

10:03.603 --> 10:04.729
Yeah, we found them.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.996
They were in the guest-room closet.

10:07.306 --> 10:10.332
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.238
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.908
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

10:23.155 --> 10:26.352
Chandler, what is this very weird
metal A-Z thing?

10:26.659 --> 10:29.822
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.259
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

10:36.002 --> 10:38.937
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.433
Yes, okay.

10:40.706 --> 10:45.166
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

10:45.444 --> 10:48.208
you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.790
Hey, dancing girl?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.334
Can I go to the bathroom?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.504
Here we go. Yeah.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.210
Looking good, Gellers!

11:21.480 --> 11:22.879
We know!

11:24.684 --> 11:28.211
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.182
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.194
Okay, everybody, hold!

11:42.034 --> 11:44.764
Next on the platforms are....

11:48.841 --> 11:51.537
You two! And....

11:53.846 --> 11:55.438
-You two!
-Cool!

11:55.715 --> 11:56.841
Excuse me, sir?

11:57.016 --> 11:59.246
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

11:59.418 --> 12:00.942
Monica!

12:01.120 --> 12:02.212
Would it?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.319
How about me?

12:13.899 --> 12:16.561
Hey, tall guy!

12:17.870 --> 12:20.930
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

12:21.207 --> 12:24.904
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.603
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.748
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

12:33.953 --> 12:36.615
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.584
I'm trying to win her over. I..

12:38.858 --> 12:40.348
I don't think so.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.423
You can dance with my partner.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.720
She's real mellow.

12:46.031 --> 12:49.558
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

12:49.802 --> 12:52.270
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe I could....

12:52.571 --> 12:55.802
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.436
All right. Hey.

12:57.910 --> 13:02.074
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.984
Are you in second grade?

13:08.287 --> 13:10.983
Hey, man, you're the one
who wet his pants.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.820
Monica would not
hide the presents down here.

13:19.999 --> 13:24.265
No, but she did. Look, there's
that old hippie I've always wanted.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.974
If they are here,
Gunther knows about it.

13:29.141 --> 13:33.805
And I could get it out of him.
He's had a huge crush on me.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.278
That's not fair to play with his head,
though. You do it.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.110
Okay.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.584
Hey, Gunther.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.016
Hi.

13:45.191 --> 13:49.093
Getting to be that holiday time again, huh?

13:49.261 --> 13:52.162
Yes, it's like a miracle.

13:52.331 --> 13:57.428
I was thinking, since it's the time
of giving gifts...

13:57.603 --> 14:01.039
I was wondering, are there any
presents around here for me?

14:01.207 --> 14:04.142
You know what I mean?

14:04.977 --> 14:08.572
-I think I found them.
-That's the Toys for Tots collection bin.

14:08.747 --> 14:13.684
-That's awfully convenient, don't you think?
-For the tots it is.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.354
-Hey, you guys, guess what.
-Did you find them?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.617
No, Gunther fainted.

14:25.764 --> 14:27.026
Man, this sucks.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.564
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous...

14:30.769 --> 14:32.999
then who's gonna be
the losers then?

14:34.740 --> 14:37.538
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.243
What?

14:39.411 --> 14:40.878
The routine!

14:42.448 --> 14:45.349
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.917
When the snippy guy
sees the routine...

14:48.187 --> 14:50.621
he'll want to build us
our own platform.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.118
Was it that good?

14:52.391 --> 14:56.452
We got honorable mention in the
brother/sister dance category!

14:56.762 --> 15:00.220
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

15:01.867 --> 15:03.630
Okay, let's do it.

15:04.136 --> 15:07.196
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

15:13.712 --> 15:15.771
Five, six, seven, eight!

15:57.623 --> 16:02.151
So do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

16:02.461 --> 16:05.362
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

16:09.168 --> 16:12.262
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.001
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

16:16.208 --> 16:18.369
When we start again,
it'll be the countdown...

16:18.677 --> 16:21.646
so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

16:22.047 --> 16:23.207
Hey, guy!

16:23.482 --> 16:25.473
You got three seconds to get away.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.049
What's going on here?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.480
Take a look at the guy's pants!

16:30.222 --> 16:34.215
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

16:35.861 --> 16:37.488
What's the matter with you? Go!

16:37.696 --> 16:39.721
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

16:42.368 --> 16:43.665
Can you believe this?

16:43.902 --> 16:46.063
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

16:46.305 --> 16:47.465
I know!

16:47.639 --> 16:50.733
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

16:51.143 --> 16:52.701
No.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.469
Me too!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.747
When the music starts...

16:58.017 --> 17:01.043
I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.989
Ross, we should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.689
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

17:12.931 --> 17:16.059
-Ten.
-Nine, eight.

17:16.268 --> 17:19.669
-Seven.
-Okay, it all comes down to this.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.931
Whatever happens, happens.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.239
Destiny.

17:25.511 --> 17:28.503
three, two, one!

17:28.781 --> 17:30.510
-Cut!
-No!

17:32.751 --> 17:34.446
Year!

17:34.720 --> 17:37.348
Happy "No" Year!

17:38.891 --> 17:42.588
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

17:48.934 --> 17:50.868
What did that snippy guy say?

17:51.036 --> 17:54.335
I think he's kicking out
anyone who's not dancing.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.667
So just keep dancing.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.415
Hey, look who I found.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.054
Oh, hi, guys!

18:12.791 --> 18:15.191
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.294
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

18:19.398 --> 18:22.890
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

18:23.368 --> 18:27.566
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.808
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.046
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.943
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.546
How about my "az"?

18:46.258 --> 18:50.024
-Hey. This is hollow.
-What?

18:50.195 --> 18:53.961
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

18:55.667 --> 18:58.898
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!

19:00.906 --> 19:01.930
What?

19:02.174 --> 19:04.608
All right, no, we could look at them.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.277
This one's for me!

19:06.478 --> 19:08.776
This one's for Chandler. Here.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.508
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!

19:13.752 --> 19:16.915
-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
-Why?

19:17.189 --> 19:20.488
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

19:20.692 --> 19:24.423
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.654
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

19:26.932 --> 19:30.197
We have to put these back.
This is not what Christmas is about.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.661
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

19:36.608 --> 19:39.839
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

19:40.145 --> 19:43.842
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.608
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.653
So, please, please, can we just...?
Can we put them back?

19:52.691 --> 19:55.057
-Will you get us better gifts?
-Fine.

19:57.462 --> 19:58.827
Hey, guys.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.523
You found the presents?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.969
You let them find the presents?

20:05.237 --> 20:06.261
Great.

20:06.438 --> 20:10.306
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

20:11.210 --> 20:14.873
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.650
Home sweet home, huh?

20:24.489 --> 20:27.515
Nice to get back to reality.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.820
Plus, we know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.666
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

20:38.604 --> 20:40.333
Anyway, good night.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.867
-Joey?
-Yeah?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.775
Three...

20:47.246 --> 20:49.339
two, one.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.221
Happy New Year.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.619
What was that for?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.260
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...

21:08.467 --> 21:12.426
I was really, really disappointed,
and I just....

21:12.938 --> 21:14.929
I just really wanted to kiss you.

21:15.407 --> 21:16.806
Really?

21:18.277 --> 21:22.270
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

21:22.814 --> 21:25.214
-In the moment.
-But only in the moment.

21:27.319 --> 21:31.449
So do you want to kiss again?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.385
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.818
Can you wait?

21:37.296 --> 21:38.729
No.

21:40.599 --> 21:41.793
Me neither.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.769
Three, two....

21:48.006 --> 21:50.304
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.475
Oh. Okay.

21:53.512 --> 21:58.506
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

22:21.206 --> 22:24.698
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium...

22:24.910 --> 22:27.640
and the guy yells, "Cut!"

22:27.946 --> 22:33.543
-So Joey didn't get to kiss Janine?
-Nope, he sure didn't.

22:33.719 --> 22:37.246
I guess that means
that you guys are still tied.

22:37.422 --> 22:41.483
I don't know about that.
I think she saw us do our routine.

22:41.660 --> 22:45.323
I may have boogied right into first place.

22:45.897 --> 22:49.799
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did...

22:49.968 --> 22:52.562
the routine from eighth grade?

22:52.738 --> 22:56.333
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.510
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.407
There's no way you could've
done the end...

23:03.682 --> 23:06.014
the way you guys did it back then.

23:06.985 --> 23:10.477
What? We could do it.

23:10.756 --> 23:15.693
I don't know. You were a lot bigger..
I mean, stronger back then.

23:17.629 --> 23:19.290
I can do it, okay?

23:19.698 --> 23:22.030
Come on, let's go! Come on.

23:23.301 --> 23:24.996
One, two, three, four...

23:25.737 --> 23:27.796
five, six, seven, eight.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.529
I can't do it!

23:31.877 --> 23:35.005
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
