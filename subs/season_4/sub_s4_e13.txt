WEBVTT

00:04.270 --> 00:08.001
She is the star of the play,
and she is my girlfriend.

00:08.241 --> 00:10.869
I get to have sex with the star
of the play!

00:11.478 --> 00:14.777
-People can hear you.
-I know!

00:22.522 --> 00:24.513
She looks great, doesn't she?

00:28.161 --> 00:30.356
That is one good-looking man.

00:32.399 --> 00:37.234
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

00:38.338 --> 00:41.034
So you been doing this long?

00:41.307 --> 00:45.573
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.411
That's nice.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.517
Dude!

00:58.725 --> 01:03.253
-ls that an expensive blouse?
-lf you want it to be.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.695
Here's your girlfriend's button.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.205
The One with Rachel's Crush

02:00.854 --> 02:04.790
Do you still have your old blouses
and dresses from high school?

02:05.492 --> 02:07.926
Yeah, I think I have some around
here somewhere. Why?

02:08.194 --> 02:10.287
Maternity clothes are so expensive.

02:13.099 --> 02:16.933
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.
If you could just...

02:18.938 --> 02:20.872
...throw your purses at it.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.772
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.176
Are you out of a job?

02:26.379 --> 02:31.112
No, but they stuck me in Personal
Shopping, which is a huge step down.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.341
What is that?

02:32.619 --> 02:36.715
Where you walk around with rich people
and tell them what to buy?

02:38.191 --> 02:40.022
That sounds great!

02:44.497 --> 02:49.400
We switched apartments. You can't eat
our food. That gravy train has ended.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.493
There's gravy?

02:52.739 --> 02:56.072
If you have the big apartment, you
have to deal with people coming over.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.837
That fridge has to be stocked.
That's your apartment now.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.347
-What are you doing?
-I think I left a doughnut up here.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.624
How was Kathy's play?

03:14.961 --> 03:20.092
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex
with a real good-looking guy.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.295
It's like somebody wrote down
my worst nightmare...

03:23.603 --> 03:26.470
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.701
That's a good idea for a business.

03:29.976 --> 03:33.878
I'm totally screwed. They're gonna be
hot and heavy on stage every night...

03:34.113 --> 03:37.913
...then they'll go to their cast parties,
and he's gonna try to undermine me.

03:38.117 --> 03:41.609
He'll be like, "Where's your boyfriend?
What's his name? Chester?"

03:41.888 --> 03:45.153
She'll go, "It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever!"

03:47.760 --> 03:49.387
That is a good trick.

03:51.464 --> 03:54.058
All right, look.
What am I going to do?

03:54.300 --> 03:57.235
They're actors.
They're there to do a job.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.767
It doesn't mean they're
gonna get together.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.840
Just because it happened with
Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

04:03.009 --> 04:05.068
...doesn't mean it's gonna
happen with them.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.278
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.507
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.313
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.680
They're not a couple.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.653
I get the game now.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.753
All these people were in movies together.
It's much different with plays.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.661
You were in acting class
together, and she slept with you.

04:27.834 --> 04:31.031
Acting class is a lot more
like a movie than a play.

04:31.204 --> 04:35.538
When they were doing it on stage,
was it really hot?

04:35.742 --> 04:37.004
Oh, yeah.

04:39.646 --> 04:40.908
So you're fine.

04:41.147 --> 04:45.413
The rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...

04:45.618 --> 04:48.815
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.

04:49.088 --> 04:53.320
As long as it's hot on stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

04:53.526 --> 04:56.086
When the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

04:57.196 --> 04:58.185
Really?

04:58.364 --> 05:02.300
You guys have been to every play I've been
in. Have I ever had chemistry on stage?

05:02.468 --> 05:03.730
-No.
-No!

05:08.641 --> 05:11.735
Are you gonna go see
the play with me tonight?

05:11.911 --> 05:17.144
I don't know how comfortable I am going
to see how hot the sex is between them.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.750
-I know, but
-No, I'm there.

05:23.556 --> 05:26.150
-Want some pancakes?
-You made pancakes?

05:26.359 --> 05:27.690
Grab a plate.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.962
No, no. Stay right there.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.391
Getting closer.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.162
Don't worry...

05:38.371 --> 05:41.306
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles and...

05:41.541 --> 05:46.240
...jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm sure are the same thing.

05:46.746 --> 05:50.079
Please eat, because Joey
opened everything.

05:50.817 --> 05:55.379
We're watching the game here Saturday
night, if people wanna come over.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.580
I was thinking about having people over.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.758
Yeah? Who's playing?

06:01.894 --> 06:03.919
The players.

06:04.897 --> 06:08.731
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

06:09.635 --> 06:13.833
Please. It's a relief, is what
it is, is what it is.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.472
Pheebs, stick out your plate.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.642
Monica, I'm quitting.

06:25.818 --> 06:30.152
I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.389
I'm quitting.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.093
I'm talking to my boss right now.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.295
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.761
Okay, bye. Call me when you
get this message.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.735
Mr. Waltham?
I really need to talk to you.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.597
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.171
And you have a customer.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.003
Hi.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.441
Hi, I'm Joshua.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.207
I'm Rachel Greene.
What could I do for you, Joshua?

06:57.950 --> 07:02.353
I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife
Well, my ex-wife

07:02.588 --> 07:05.250
I'm so sorry.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.756
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.

07:11.998 --> 07:16.833
I got away with this suit
and what turned out to be a skirt.

07:17.069 --> 07:20.004
Well, at least that's a great suit.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.733
It wasn't much fun dropping
it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

07:25.945 --> 07:30.780
I need everything down to underwear.
If you're willing, I'm all yours.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.380
Okay.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.180
You needed to speak to me?

07:35.388 --> 07:37.117
No, no, that wasn't me.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.827
We should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.692
The selection of underwear
that we carry.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.661
I'm sorry.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.239
-It's this way.
-This way? Sorry.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.709
I'm right. Right? There was
no chemistry between them.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.544
Before, they had heat.
Now, there's no heat.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.513
You know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.

08:10.756 --> 08:15.489
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
There was some sexual chemistry.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.855
Come on.
It was like cousins having sex.

08:20.533 --> 08:25.334
Here she comes. Don't say a word.
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.237
Hey, you guys!

08:29.742 --> 08:32.210
Thank you so much for coming again.

08:32.411 --> 08:34.242
-Did you like it tonight?
-Absolutely.

08:36.215 --> 08:39.241
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.684
It's a good play, isn't it?

08:47.059 --> 08:49.289
I loved the play.
You were great.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.395
And Nick, ditto.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.727
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.999
Okay....

09:04.577 --> 09:06.943
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

09:07.179 --> 09:09.943
It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.

09:11.417 --> 09:16.411
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?

09:16.889 --> 09:21.792
I can see how this could happen. You're up
there every night naked, touching, kissing.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.029
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

09:25.264 --> 09:28.597
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?

09:29.101 --> 09:32.070
You can understand,
given how we started.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.034
I can't believe you're
throwing that in my face.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.368
That is what happened.
I don't even see you denying this.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.439
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
You call me when you grow up.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.846
Don't expect that to happen
any time soon!

09:51.791 --> 09:54.624
I have the best job
in the entire world!

09:54.927 --> 10:00.024
The most adorable guy came over,
and I got to dress him up all day!

10:00.900 --> 10:02.663
Rachel has a new doll!

10:03.669 --> 10:07.002
I wish he was a doll. I'd get a Rachel
doll and bump them together...

10:07.206 --> 10:09.401
...and make kissing noises.

10:10.109 --> 10:14.671
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.209
Joshua.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.780
Joshua. Josh.

10:19.585 --> 10:20.847
Hello?

10:21.020 --> 10:22.282
Hi.

10:24.724 --> 10:25.952
What do I smell?

10:26.392 --> 10:28.383
I don't know. It smells good.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.393
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.865
Please, have some.

10:40.172 --> 10:43.471
I've been fiddling around here,
making delicious treats for everyone.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.141
The new Playboy.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.142
Just something I picked up.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.578
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever!

10:57.556 --> 10:58.545
What?

10:58.758 --> 11:03.457
It's just something Joshua said about
V-necks, but you had to be there.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.157
How does Jason look in a V-neck?

11:06.432 --> 11:09.094
-It's Joshua.
-Whatever.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.533
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout!

11:14.774 --> 11:17.504
-Hate to eat and run.
-No, wait. Please, don't go!

11:17.910 --> 11:20.003
I've got porn for you too.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.942
I don't need it.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.610
People are supposed to want
to hang out here.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.649
Why? What is the big deal?

11:27.853 --> 11:30.253
I'm the hostess.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.287
Not those guys.
I'm always the hostess.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.690
Even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.089
I served the best air.

11:40.833 --> 11:45.099
Why'd you make a big thing out of everyone
hanging out in the big apartment?

11:45.304 --> 11:48.273
'Cause they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.374
I'm done now. They've suffered enough.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.972
If you wanted to punish them, you should
have just made them hang out here.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.479
That is true.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.515
This place is gonna be 10 times
better than that place.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.847
Are we gonna
trash their place?

12:04.690 --> 12:06.385
There's steps!

12:08.461 --> 12:09.689
Slut!

12:14.066 --> 12:18.969
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!

12:19.171 --> 12:20.832
-What?
-You were right?

12:21.107 --> 12:24.668
I confronted her,
and she didn't deny it.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.811
I don't live here!

12:32.451 --> 12:33.975
Wait, are you sure?

12:34.253 --> 12:37.017
I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.190
Then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's....

12:42.328 --> 12:44.489
-Beefsteak Charlie's?
-Yes!

12:44.697 --> 12:46.858
You and l
have always been like:

12:49.635 --> 12:51.193
Man, I am so sorry.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.271
The bartender taught me
a trick, though.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.847
I don't remember it.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.367
-Do you need help with that?
-I got it.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.664
I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

13:30.342 --> 13:35.302
I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.972
-Just so frustrating.
-Why don't you ask him out?

13:38.217 --> 13:40.685
Totally. That's such a turn-on.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.348
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

13:43.589 --> 13:45.853
That's the turn-on.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.487
He just got a divorce. Right?
He's probably really nervous around women.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.924
Maybe you just need to
make the first move.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.862
-I've never asked a guy out before.
-You've never asked a guy out?

13:57.069 --> 13:58.093
No. Have you?

13:58.370 --> 14:00.338
Thousands of times!

14:02.007 --> 14:04.908
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

14:05.110 --> 14:07.408
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.275
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down, and I say...

14:11.517 --> 14:15.351
..."Hey. How you doing?"

14:17.356 --> 14:18.948
Oh, please!

14:19.191 --> 14:22.183
Hey. How you doing?

14:26.732 --> 14:31.692
You know what? I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna call him up and ask him out.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.667
I can do that, ask him out.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.931
"How you doing?"

14:40.246 --> 14:44.012
Hi, Joshua.
It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.382
I was just wondering if you...?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.315
If you...

14:52.258 --> 14:54.749
...Ieft your wallet
at the store today?

14:56.495 --> 14:59.089
We found a wallet, and we

14:59.665 --> 15:03.157
The license? That is a good idea.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.272
Well, let's see.
This license belongs to...

15:07.473 --> 15:11.500
...belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

15:16.115 --> 15:20.643
So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.821
-You've done that a thousand times?
-I've never done that.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.992
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.

15:29.194 --> 15:32.459
You gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like...

15:32.731 --> 15:36.565
...Knicks tickets. Invite him to a Knicks
game. You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.963
-Really? You think that'll work?
-Absolutely. And if not, can I go?

15:42.741 --> 15:44.538
What the heck is that?

15:57.756 --> 15:59.986
Did she call?

16:01.226 --> 16:03.353
No. Sorry.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.588
Maybe I should call her.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.198
Forget her, man. You don't need her.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.891
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.003
Well, yeah, but, you know,
what if I was wrong?

16:14.440 --> 16:15.873
How might you be wrong?

16:16.342 --> 16:19.277
What if she didn't actually
sleep with the guy?

16:19.445 --> 16:20.935
Tell me she told you this.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.274
She didn't have to tell me.
I saw the play. There was no heat.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.577
-Back me up.
-That's all you're basing this on?

16:26.752 --> 16:28.549
That's not backing me up!

16:28.821 --> 16:32.313
Look, you said,
"With the offstage and the heat"

16:32.591 --> 16:36.891
That was just a theory. There's a lot
of theories that didn't pan out:

16:37.196 --> 16:41.656
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.559
Oh, my God!

16:47.373 --> 16:50.570
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with?"

16:51.010 --> 16:54.605
"It's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets"

16:59.418 --> 17:01.113
"Who likes the Knick?"

17:04.256 --> 17:06.520
What do you think?

17:06.759 --> 17:11.287
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

17:12.297 --> 17:14.424
...I think you look great.

17:16.735 --> 17:19.363
Oh, yeah. You look great.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.743
This looks great.

17:28.647 --> 17:29.636
So you like it?

17:29.915 --> 17:33.146
I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'll wear it home.

17:33.385 --> 17:37.253
-Great.
-Thank you so much for all your help.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.018
Well, I guess this is it.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.719
Thanks.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.826
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
for the bathing suits.

17:46.031 --> 17:48.192
You don't want to do that now?

17:49.268 --> 17:50.963
That's okay.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.931
I'll see you around sometime.

17:53.439 --> 17:54.667
Basketball!

17:56.708 --> 17:58.403
Sorry?

17:59.611 --> 18:02.671
I have two tickets to the
Knicks game if you're interested...

18:02.881 --> 18:05.315
...just as a thank-you for this week.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.181
That would be great!

18:09.388 --> 18:11.481
-Really?
-That would be fantastic!

18:11.723 --> 18:15.318
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!

18:16.662 --> 18:20.063
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.561
Good morning.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.111
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

18:36.315 --> 18:39.079
I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.980
I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.481
I really wish you'd called me.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.522
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.094
I think this is a good thing.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.856
We've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.902
I know for me, but

19:04.543 --> 19:06.170
Nick's pants?

19:10.349 --> 19:14.080
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one!

19:20.292 --> 19:23.784
-For next time, what do you say?
-"l have an extra ticket."

19:24.062 --> 19:27.190
"An extra ticket."
Not "two tickets."

19:29.568 --> 19:33.163
The first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.241
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.444
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.944
Okay, it's ready.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.649
-Come on.
-What's ready?

19:50.088 --> 19:52.079
Just come.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.185
Oh, my God!

19:58.764 --> 20:00.823
This is beautiful!

20:01.099 --> 20:04.865
Did you work for two days straight?

20:05.771 --> 20:07.329
Pretty much.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.970
What do you think of the floor?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.336
I don't know.
Looks the same.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.569
You used to have carpet.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.209
Oh, yeah.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.477
I made snacks.

20:19.718 --> 20:20.980
Please, just hang out.

20:21.286 --> 20:24.119
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

20:25.757 --> 20:27.554
Do you want us to come back later?

20:27.793 --> 20:31.889
No, no, no. Stay.
Just keep talking.

20:32.297 --> 20:35.460
I'm always the hostess.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.434
How'd it go?

20:39.671 --> 20:41.901
-She wasn't sleeping with him.
-Good!

20:42.307 --> 20:44.241
She is now.

20:46.578 --> 20:51.675
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

20:52.184 --> 20:56.086
You think you know a person, then they
turn around and sleep with Nick.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.587
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

21:02.794 --> 21:05.592
I hate him.
And I hate her.

21:05.831 --> 21:09.528
I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.795
How? How is it your fault?

21:14.006 --> 21:15.098
I should have called.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.832
If I had called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick.

21:19.111 --> 21:23.707
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his man-nipples!

21:26.184 --> 21:27.776
This is not your fault.

21:28.020 --> 21:32.480
Your fight does not
justify her sleeping with someone.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.858
Well, if she thought
they were on a break....

21:43.869 --> 21:48.636
Rachel, one of your customers seems to
have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.899
Really?

21:50.075 --> 21:54.068
-Will you call him?
-Yes, I will. Absolutely.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.023
Hello, Rachel.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.196
Hi, Joshua.

22:12.397 --> 22:16.197
-I left my wallet here on purpose.
-Really?

22:16.401 --> 22:18.631
Yes. I just wanted to see you again.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.701
I'm glad.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.309
Rachel, I'd like to say
something to you.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.005
Yes?

22:26.645 --> 22:28.670
"How you doing?"
