00:04.016 --> 00:07.144
Chandler, you're doing so well
with this whole getting married...

00:07.319 --> 00:11.983
...never gonna sleep with anyone for the
rest of your life thing. I thinks it's great.

00:14.159 --> 00:17.185
-Hey. Who wants French toast?
-I'll have some.

00:17.396 --> 00:20.524
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

00:22.801 --> 00:25.201
-What's the matter?
-My hand feels weird.

00:25.404 --> 00:27.338
I guess it's because I'm engaged!

00:29.241 --> 00:31.801
-When will that start getting annoying?
-Start?

00:33.378 --> 00:35.369
Let's start the wedding plans.

00:35.581 --> 00:36.741
-Okay.
-Already?

00:37.015 --> 00:41.111
We got a lot to do. We gotta think
about the flowers, the music--

00:41.353 --> 00:44.186
-I have thoughts on the music--
-Chandler. Too many cooks.

00:46.091 --> 00:50.187
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

00:54.466 --> 00:57.958
-What in God's name is that?
-Oh, my God, the wedding book?

00:58.203 --> 01:00.569
I haven't seen that since fourth grade.

01:00.939 --> 01:05.899
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, locations, for instance:

01:06.144 --> 01:09.875
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

01:10.082 --> 01:12.414
...then by square footage.

01:13.452 --> 01:16.387
That is so smart.

01:16.622 --> 01:19.056
Break it off. Break it off now.

01:20.092 --> 01:24.085
Look, here's the invitation you used to your
wedding to John Lynch in the fifth grade.

01:24.262 --> 01:28.255
Remember how I got sick
and Ross had to fill in as a bridesmaid?

01:30.268 --> 01:32.793
I was a brides-boy.

01:33.772 --> 01:35.967
I don't smell French toast, brides-boy.

01:38.844 --> 01:40.971
The One With Rachel's Book

02:16.682 --> 02:18.673
That conclusively proves...

02:18.984 --> 02:22.681
...that I had the idea
for <i>Jurassic Park</i> first.

02:22.954 --> 02:24.546
Let's take a look--

02:24.990 --> 02:27.117
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

02:27.359 --> 02:30.886
I need to talk to you. it's urgent.
lt's about Monica and Chandler.

02:31.129 --> 02:33.529
Oh, my God. Of course.

02:33.965 --> 02:36.525
Would you please excuse me
for a moment?

02:36.802 --> 02:40.363
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you...?

02:41.273 --> 02:42.706
What's going on?

02:42.908 --> 02:47.504
Well, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged...

02:47.779 --> 02:50.009
...it would be nice
if they have privacy.

02:50.215 --> 02:53.878
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

02:56.855 --> 03:00.518
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

03:00.726 --> 03:02.921
Nothing. Why?

03:05.197 --> 03:06.687
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

03:06.898 --> 03:10.061
Yeah, it is.
My movie starts in, like, five minutes.

03:13.205 --> 03:17.403
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

03:19.211 --> 03:23.375
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

03:27.753 --> 03:29.550
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents...

03:29.821 --> 03:31.914
...but tell me how this is for music:

03:32.357 --> 03:35.884
A string quartet for the processional,
a jazz trio for cocktails...

03:36.094 --> 03:38.392
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing....

03:38.630 --> 03:41.531
Wait, that was
for my sixth grade wedding.

03:42.067 --> 03:46.333
You couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't even play anymore and Derek....

03:48.373 --> 03:50.773
Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

03:51.543 --> 03:55.639
Mon, do you have another pillow,
something a little snugglier?

03:55.914 --> 03:59.042
Why are you napping here
instead of at your place?

03:59.251 --> 04:01.344
-The duck.
-What-- The duck?

04:01.553 --> 04:03.919
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

04:05.290 --> 04:09.249
Well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

04:09.494 --> 04:12.759
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

04:14.232 --> 04:15.665
Do I get to look at this book...

04:15.901 --> 04:19.132
...or is it just for people
involved in the wedding?

04:20.071 --> 04:23.097
Of course you can look at it.
I want your opinion.

04:23.308 --> 04:24.400
Here you go.

04:24.643 --> 04:27.168
-What about centerpieces?
-Centerpieces!

04:27.445 --> 04:30.437
-Roses or lilies?
-Definitely roses.

04:34.786 --> 04:36.811
I think they're more ''wedding-y.''

04:39.958 --> 04:43.758
-But lilies are the clear choice.
-Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

04:46.131 --> 04:49.692
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

04:50.168 --> 04:52.432
I'm gonna get cranky.

04:53.338 --> 04:56.830
Joey, there's a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

04:57.042 --> 04:59.340
Yes, it is perfectly good...

04:59.611 --> 05:03.047
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

05:04.115 --> 05:05.139
What?

05:05.851 --> 05:09.651
-All right, I'm gonna go.
-Joey, what did the duck do?

05:09.921 --> 05:12.856
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

05:25.003 --> 05:27.870
Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?

05:31.209 --> 05:33.939
What the hell is in that face cream?

05:47.559 --> 05:49.754
That's so soft.

05:52.364 --> 05:54.559
Pillowcases!

06:09.381 --> 06:14.080
<i>''Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.</i>
<i>Her father, the vicar</i>-- <i>''</i>

06:14.352 --> 06:15.614
<i>Vicar?</i>

06:16.922 --> 06:19.186
<i>''</i>--<i>wouldn't be home for hours.</i>

06:19.424 --> 06:21.358
<i>Her loins were burning.</i>

06:21.593 --> 06:26.690
<i>She threw caution to the wind</i>
<i>and reached out and grabbed his</i>-- <i>''</i>

06:31.536 --> 06:33.561
This is a dirty book!

06:48.053 --> 06:49.213
Phoebe?

06:49.587 --> 06:51.054
Oh, Ross, hi.

06:53.892 --> 06:57.555
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Sorry, I'm with a client right now.

06:59.064 --> 07:02.033
-Phoebe!
-Okay, let's talk outside.

07:02.901 --> 07:06.928
Unfortunately, this time will be counted
as part of your massage.

07:07.105 --> 07:09.539
So try...

07:09.708 --> 07:12.040
...and think relaxing thoughts.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.474
And don't touch any of my dinosaurs.

07:14.646 --> 07:17.911
I know they're cool, but they're mine.

07:19.918 --> 07:22.887
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

07:23.221 --> 07:25.621
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

07:25.824 --> 07:27.485
And they knew about it?

07:31.296 --> 07:33.821
Okay, Ross, what is this really about?

07:34.466 --> 07:38.300
This is my home and I want to be
able to come and go when I want.

07:38.503 --> 07:41.904
I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

07:42.207 --> 07:43.902
I don't know what the big deal is.

07:44.109 --> 07:47.078
I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

07:47.312 --> 07:51.578
...when I want to kick back
with a puzzle-- Beer, cold beer.

07:54.486 --> 07:56.477
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

07:56.855 --> 08:00.723
Sweeping. Why?
Does it turn you on?

08:02.927 --> 08:04.087
No.

08:06.498 --> 08:09.490
What if I was sweeping a chimney?

08:11.669 --> 08:13.728
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

08:17.042 --> 08:19.875
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

08:25.784 --> 08:29.811
Joey, where did you learn that word?

08:32.457 --> 08:34.118
Where do you think...

08:34.859 --> 08:35.883
...Zelda?

08:38.763 --> 08:42.028
-You found my book?!
-Yeah, I did!

08:43.001 --> 08:46.027
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

08:46.271 --> 08:50.332
I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!

08:52.410 --> 08:56.369
God! I cannot believe you invaded
my privacy like that!

08:56.548 --> 08:58.311
Zelda.

08:58.883 --> 09:03.217
Now, you seem a little tense. Maybe
you'll relax if I gave you a nice milk bath.

09:03.388 --> 09:05.481
Okay, you know what?

09:05.990 --> 09:08.959
-I don't even like that part.
-Oh, I do.

09:10.195 --> 09:13.460
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

09:13.698 --> 09:18.533
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

09:18.803 --> 09:22.637
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

09:22.874 --> 09:26.867
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

09:29.380 --> 09:31.041
You got porn.

09:52.770 --> 09:56.672
-Hello.
-Hi, is Phoebe here?

09:57.375 --> 10:00.867
-No, she's out for the night.
-Oh, great.

10:01.579 --> 10:04.013
Can I help you with something?

10:04.382 --> 10:06.247
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

10:06.985 --> 10:08.384
Yes, I am.

10:10.355 --> 10:12.755
Great! Dad?

10:18.296 --> 10:21.265
Thank you so much.
I'll pick him up in an hour.

10:32.510 --> 10:34.740
You need help with that?

10:39.017 --> 10:42.714
Your parents must've been thrilled
when you told them you were engaged.

10:42.954 --> 10:45.184
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

10:46.224 --> 10:48.488
I remember when we first got engaged.

10:48.693 --> 10:50.854
-I've never heard that story.
-Dad, you don't--

10:51.062 --> 10:53.292
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

10:54.866 --> 10:56.629
I still don't know how.

10:56.935 --> 11:01.463
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

11:04.475 --> 11:06.238
What a sweet story.

11:07.312 --> 11:10.213
At least you're not hearing it
at your fifth grade Halloween party.

11:10.448 --> 11:12.075
They wanted a scary story.

11:13.718 --> 11:16.084
We're really excited
about our wedding plans.

11:16.354 --> 11:20.518
I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

11:25.263 --> 11:27.891
-What?
-You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.657
You have the wedding fund, don't you?

11:30.868 --> 11:34.099
We have it.
Only, now we call it ''the beach house.''

11:36.908 --> 11:39.536
You spent my wedding
fund on the beach house?

11:39.777 --> 11:41.244
We're sorry. We assumed...

11:41.479 --> 11:44.312
...that if you got married after 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

11:44.782 --> 11:47.148
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

11:47.552 --> 11:49.679
So you've had seven years
of beach fun...

11:49.954 --> 11:52.149
...and you can't put a price on that.

11:54.759 --> 11:56.659
We do feel bad about this.

11:56.861 --> 11:58.692
We saved again
when you dated Richard...

11:58.963 --> 12:01.591
...then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

12:04.435 --> 12:05.959
What about Chandler?

12:06.170 --> 12:08.502
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd propose.

12:10.074 --> 12:13.475
Clearly I did not start drinking
enough at the start of the meal.

12:14.479 --> 12:16.572
I can't believe there's no money
for my wedding.

12:16.781 --> 12:18.874
Maybe, if your father hadn't tried...

12:19.117 --> 12:21.813
...to sell ice over the lnternet.

12:22.020 --> 12:25.683
-It seemed like such a simple idea.
-Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

12:25.957 --> 12:29.154
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.

12:29.394 --> 12:30.793
Good luck, Chandler.

12:55.486 --> 12:59.354
Okay, now I'm going to...

13:00.358 --> 13:01.655
...touch you.

13:11.936 --> 13:13.904
That's soft.

13:45.570 --> 13:49.973
Why does Joey keep talking
about chimney sweeps and vicars?

13:51.109 --> 13:55.011
I thinks he's just been rehearsing
for an episode of his show.

13:55.613 --> 13:58.946
Because it really sounds
like a bad porn novel.

14:00.952 --> 14:03.819
Do you think your parents
could help pay for it?

14:04.021 --> 14:05.010
I don't know.

14:05.189 --> 14:09.455
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.026
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

14:12.330 --> 14:17.029
And any extra cash my father has
he saves for his yearly trips to...

14:17.835 --> 14:19.132
...Dollywood.

14:21.472 --> 14:25.033
-What happened at dinner?
-My parents spent the wedding fund.

14:25.843 --> 14:28.403
My God, what did you order?

14:29.847 --> 14:34.546
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

14:34.786 --> 14:38.278
You guys are gonna have to get
married in, like, a rec center.

14:39.323 --> 14:41.052
Oh, my God, you're right.

14:41.225 --> 14:45.685
We're gonna have to be out by 6 so they
can take out the floor for senior swim.

14:46.864 --> 14:50.493
-Honey, it's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not gonna be okay.

14:50.935 --> 14:55.235
-No swing band, no lilies.
-No, but that's good.

14:55.406 --> 14:57.704
You don't want lilies.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.639
If a cat ate them, it would die.

15:03.714 --> 15:07.707
-What?
-I'm just saying, now you could invite cats.

15:10.054 --> 15:11.487
It's gonna be okay.

15:11.656 --> 15:14.420
I mean, you don't need to have this...

15:14.659 --> 15:17.526
...rustic italian feast.

15:17.762 --> 15:19.923
You don't need this custom-made...

15:20.164 --> 15:24.225
...empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

15:24.469 --> 15:26.164
You can wear off-the-rack.

15:31.642 --> 15:33.166
It's really gonna be okay.

15:33.377 --> 15:37.541
The important thing is that we love each
other and we're gonna get married.

15:37.782 --> 15:41.445
Do you even understand what
''off-the-rack'' means?

15:43.387 --> 15:45.321
Why don't you pay for it yourself?

15:45.523 --> 15:47.013
How? I don't have any money.

15:47.258 --> 15:49.249
-Well, I have some.
-How much?

15:49.460 --> 15:50.518
Well, close to....

16:03.307 --> 16:05.366
-Are you kidding me?!
-How much?

16:05.576 --> 16:08.477
-Enough for wedding scenario A.
-Really?

16:08.913 --> 16:14.249
Scenario A has lilies. Someone's gonna have
to break it to the cats and it won't be me.

16:15.286 --> 16:17.982
How great are you, you little saver!

16:18.289 --> 16:21.258
This is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

16:21.459 --> 16:24.394
You guys are so made for each other.

16:25.530 --> 16:28.966
You're not suggesting that we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.792
Yeah.

16:32.303 --> 16:36.000
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

16:36.207 --> 16:40.473
...and I kind of had some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

16:40.678 --> 16:44.341
Hello, Mr. Chandler.

16:47.118 --> 16:50.610
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

16:50.821 --> 16:54.723
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

16:54.959 --> 16:57.189
Honey, I love you.

16:57.461 --> 17:00.862
But if you call our wedding
a party one more time...

17:01.132 --> 17:02.690
...you may not get invited.

17:05.436 --> 17:09.429
We can always earn more money.
We're only gonna get married once.

17:09.640 --> 17:14.077
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.

17:15.313 --> 17:17.508
You're gonna have to ''put your foot down''?

17:17.715 --> 17:20.013
Yes, I am.

17:22.587 --> 17:25.147
Money and a firm hand.

17:25.389 --> 17:27.983
Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.

17:36.567 --> 17:39.001
-Hey, Rach.
-Joey.

17:40.771 --> 17:43.501
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

17:43.708 --> 17:47.974
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

17:48.713 --> 17:52.114
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

17:52.917 --> 17:54.043
Something's on fire.

17:54.385 --> 17:56.216
No, I don't smell anything.

17:56.787 --> 18:00.120
Oh, you know what? it's probably
just your burning loins.

18:04.895 --> 18:07.864
-Hey, what are you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

18:11.569 --> 18:13.400
Damn, this coffee's cold.

18:13.604 --> 18:15.799
Do you mind if I heat this up
on your loins?

18:19.810 --> 18:23.610
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey....

18:24.015 --> 18:27.212
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.

18:27.451 --> 18:31.080
Yeah, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

18:32.556 --> 18:33.818
Oh, yeah?

18:34.091 --> 18:38.027
Well, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

18:39.096 --> 18:40.290
What's up?

18:41.732 --> 18:45.725
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

18:48.305 --> 18:50.102
E<i>x</i>cuse me, ladies.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.598
I'm sorry?

18:52.810 --> 18:55.176
My massage client, Arthur.

18:55.413 --> 18:58.314
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me...

18:58.549 --> 19:00.449
...gave him a really weird massage.

19:00.651 --> 19:03.552
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

19:04.155 --> 19:07.147
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

19:07.358 --> 19:10.122
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

19:10.361 --> 19:13.455
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

19:13.664 --> 19:17.862
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

19:20.104 --> 19:23.870
Well, he's never coming back.
You just cost me $80 a week.

19:24.108 --> 19:27.339
This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

19:27.611 --> 19:30.444
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

19:30.614 --> 19:31.706
You could've sent him away.

19:31.982 --> 19:35.008
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

19:36.687 --> 19:39.315
He said he liked that!

19:41.792 --> 19:44.727
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

19:45.096 --> 19:48.293
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

19:50.468 --> 19:52.868
-His daughter was hot.
-Gotcha.

19:55.573 --> 19:58.872
Look, Ross,
I really need that $80 every week.

19:59.043 --> 20:01.705
I'm sure you'll find
another massage client, Phoebe.

20:01.879 --> 20:05.576
Yeah, I'm sure I will too. But until then,
I'm going to massage you every week...

20:05.750 --> 20:08.651
-...for the price of $ 1 00.
-You just said 80.

20:08.819 --> 20:10.810
You want me to mess up your puzzle?

20:10.988 --> 20:13.149
A hundred it is.

20:25.436 --> 20:27.131
Hello, Zelda.

20:29.106 --> 20:32.337
-Who are you supposed to be?
-The vicar.

20:33.144 --> 20:37.171
-Do you even know what a vicar is?
-Like a goalie, right?

20:39.450 --> 20:40.940
Look, that's enough.

20:41.118 --> 20:42.608
The joke's over. I'm sick of it.

20:42.787 --> 20:46.484
You mean this isn't the sweet torment
you've been waiting all your life for?

20:46.657 --> 20:49.148
Joey, I'm serious, all right? it's enough.

20:49.326 --> 20:52.318
You make stupid jokes
and sleazy innuendoes...

20:52.563 --> 20:54.428
...and it's just not funny anymore.

20:54.632 --> 20:57.931
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.

20:58.135 --> 21:02.435
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

21:05.075 --> 21:08.476
All right, that's it.
You wanna do it? Let's do it.

21:10.948 --> 21:13.382
That's right.
I wanna do it with you.

21:15.186 --> 21:19.850
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

21:20.124 --> 21:21.318
I did?

21:21.592 --> 21:24.891
Yeah. Oh, l've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

21:25.963 --> 21:28.363
-This body?
-Yeah, that's right.

21:28.632 --> 21:30.657
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

21:30.868 --> 21:34.531
You're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.

21:35.039 --> 21:39.032
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Get those clothes off.

21:39.243 --> 21:43.509
But I'd keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

21:44.682 --> 21:46.513
I don't want to. I'm scared.

21:55.059 --> 21:56.151
Listen...

21:58.395 --> 22:00.488
...I've been thinking.

22:00.698 --> 22:04.998
It's not fair of me to ask you to
spend all of your money on our wedding.

22:05.236 --> 22:08.171
I mean, you work really hard for that.

22:08.505 --> 22:10.598
-Well.
-Well, you work for that.

22:12.710 --> 22:15.338
Look, I've thought about it too.

22:15.579 --> 22:20.016
I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

22:21.051 --> 22:24.885
-You do?
-Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

22:26.690 --> 22:29.420
Look, when I proposed,
I told you...

22:29.693 --> 22:33.060
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

22:33.297 --> 22:36.630
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

22:36.867 --> 22:38.994
...then that's what we're gonna do.

22:39.403 --> 22:41.803
You are so sweet.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.871
What about the future and stuff?

22:49.079 --> 22:51.411
Forget about the future and stuff.

22:51.649 --> 22:53.014
So we only have two kids.

22:53.250 --> 22:57.050
We'll pick our favorite and
that one will get to go to college.

22:58.088 --> 23:00.716
-Have you thought about that?
-Yeah.

23:00.958 --> 23:02.550
How many kids were we gonna have?

23:02.760 --> 23:06.526
Four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.164
What else did you think about?

23:10.401 --> 23:13.336
Well, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

23:13.604 --> 23:16.232
Like a small place outside the city...

23:16.440 --> 23:19.671
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes.

23:19.944 --> 23:22.777
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

23:23.047 --> 23:27.541
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

23:27.785 --> 23:31.812
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

23:37.294 --> 23:38.556
You know what?

23:39.763 --> 23:42.459
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.998
-Sure you do.
-No.

23:46.570 --> 23:51.269
I want everything that you've
just said. I want a marriage.

23:52.443 --> 23:53.774
You sure?

23:56.580 --> 23:59.811
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

24:04.989 --> 24:08.823
When you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

24:09.093 --> 24:10.856
But you meant dog, right?

24:14.365 --> 24:16.299
-Yeah, totally.
-Oh, good.

24:21.605 --> 24:23.937
Room temperature okay?

24:24.441 --> 24:27.342
-Excellent. Is the music too loud?
-No.

24:27.511 --> 24:28.808
Good.

24:34.418 --> 24:36.579
-What the hell are you doing?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

24:36.754 --> 24:40.713
Were you expecting a traditional massage
with the hands?

24:41.392 --> 24:43.189
Fine.

24:45.029 --> 24:47.429
Now, just try to relax.

24:51.035 --> 24:52.024
