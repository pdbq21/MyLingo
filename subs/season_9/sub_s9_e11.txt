WEBVTT

00:03.574 --> 00:05.042
Good morning, tiger.

00:05.243 --> 00:09.582
I'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

00:09.753 --> 00:12.223
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

00:13.493 --> 00:16.465
I've got nowhere to go this morning.
I'm unemployed.

00:16.633 --> 00:18.569
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

00:18.837 --> 00:21.832
Well, I just lost my erection.

00:22.210 --> 00:24.738
No, I mean, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.249
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

00:27.421 --> 00:30.188
You can be whatever you want
to be now. It's exciting.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.491
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.638
Wait a second.
I can help you with this.

00:36.807 --> 00:41.111
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications..

00:41.282 --> 00:47.056
and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files..

00:47.260 --> 00:51.759
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.031
I know!

00:54.475 --> 00:56.571
My erection is back!

01:46.345 --> 01:47.507
Thank you.

01:47.682 --> 01:50.813
Joey, could I have a sip of your coffee
and a bite of your muffin?

01:50.988 --> 01:52.890
- Okay.
- Thank you.

02:00.139 --> 02:01.368
Thank you.

02:03.981 --> 02:06.976
Phoebe, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry Italian?

02:08.155 --> 02:11.059
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

02:11.228 --> 02:13.391
If you want,
I could loan you some money.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.629
Oh, no. I learned never to
borrow money from friends.

02:16.806 --> 02:21.076
That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.

02:21.482 --> 02:23.578
Why don't you
just spunge off your boyfriend?

02:23.754 --> 02:27.751
Yeah, right, the unemployed piano player
who gave his trust fund to charity?

02:27.928 --> 02:29.989
I'm splitting the muffin with him.

02:31.368 --> 02:34.864
Hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

02:35.076 --> 02:36.442
You could do that?

02:36.613 --> 02:40.017
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

02:40.186 --> 02:43.626
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
- Okay, now..

02:43.794 --> 02:47.598
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

02:47.768 --> 02:51.538
- Really?
- No, it is awesome.

02:52.077 --> 02:53.443
Hey, guys.

02:56.018 --> 02:57.578
Why are you all dressed up?

02:57.755 --> 03:02.128
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

03:02.297 --> 03:04.494
- Doesn't she look cute?
- She sure does.

03:04.669 --> 03:07.231
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

03:07.407 --> 03:10.174
Because if one more person says,
"What a cute little boy"..

03:10.346 --> 03:13.147
I'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

03:13.352 --> 03:15.949
I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office.

03:16.125 --> 03:20.429
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter
than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

03:22.337 --> 03:24.000
Can I get a blue bow?

03:27.213 --> 03:29.980
Okay. I have looked through
a bunch of career guides..

03:30.153 --> 03:32.624
photocopied and highlighted
key passages..

03:32.792 --> 03:37.962
and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.298
How long was I in there?

03:41.141 --> 03:44.113
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.177
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

03:49.759 --> 03:51.854
Don't you wanna look through the rest?

03:52.998 --> 03:56.733
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

03:56.906 --> 03:58.899
Sorry you had to waste all this time.

03:59.077 --> 04:03.279
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

04:03.452 --> 04:05.514
Now I'll get to use my shredder!

04:06.191 --> 04:10.188
I mean, I could write slogans.
How hard could it be, right?

04:10.466 --> 04:15.374
"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."

04:18.382 --> 04:23.324
"Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy."

04:23.492 --> 04:28.298
"A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?"

04:29.437 --> 04:30.462
I got one.

04:30.641 --> 04:34.672
"Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best."

04:34.849 --> 04:36.408
Honey, leave it to the pros.

04:37.855 --> 04:39.848
I actually know someone in advertising.

04:40.026 --> 04:42.998
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

04:43.432 --> 04:45.926
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

04:46.104 --> 04:51.240
"The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones."

04:52.551 --> 04:55.021
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

04:59.331 --> 05:02.896
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

05:03.138 --> 05:06.634
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

05:07.548 --> 05:10.645
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

05:14.227 --> 05:16.755
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

05:16.933 --> 05:20.337
I'm the hell person
whose office this is.

05:20.507 --> 05:22.704
Good one, Rach.

05:23.112 --> 05:25.811
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

05:26.218 --> 05:27.812
Excuse me?

05:28.857 --> 05:31.829
Your baby's so cute.

05:32.063 --> 05:35.035
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

05:40.079 --> 05:42.311
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

05:42.483 --> 05:43.975
I'm a nurse.

05:44.154 --> 05:45.281
Yes, you are.

05:45.489 --> 05:48.484
I think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

05:48.663 --> 05:51.829
Sorry, I'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

05:52.003 --> 05:55.498
- So are you excited about your scene?
- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

05:55.677 --> 05:59.411
Relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

05:59.618 --> 06:02.818
- Good.
- You. Here, come here. Here.

06:02.991 --> 06:06.452
Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.
You're gonna move on "action."

06:06.632 --> 06:10.435
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

06:10.607 --> 06:12.200
Don't walk too fast.

06:12.811 --> 06:15.407
But don't dawdle.

06:15.684 --> 06:17.711
Okay. Now, what?

06:18.656 --> 06:22.026
And, action!

06:27.574 --> 06:28.633
Cut! Cut.

06:28.810 --> 06:32.305
- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
- Well, don't be.

06:32.985 --> 06:35.319
Okay, that helps.

06:36.158 --> 06:38.721
And, action!

06:42.838 --> 06:43.897
Cut!

06:44.107 --> 06:47.911
Don't worry about it, Phoebe.
It usually takes me three takes too.

06:48.081 --> 06:49.344
All right, eight.

06:50.754 --> 06:56.197
And, action!

07:13.666 --> 07:16.193
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

07:16.371 --> 07:20.106
No. But let me show you what I can do.

07:20.747 --> 07:23.149
"Bagels and doughnuts.

07:23.318 --> 07:27.315
Round food for every mood."

07:28.563 --> 07:31.056
Monica warned me you might do that.

07:32.971 --> 07:35.807
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.

07:35.977 --> 07:40.008
- Really? That's great.
- It's an unpaid internship.

07:41.488 --> 07:45.657
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
it sounded like you said "unpaid."

07:45.864 --> 07:50.134
It won't be forever. It just takes a year
or two to get good portfolio together.

07:50.306 --> 07:56.308
Well, I can skip a couple of steps, right?
I mean, you did hear my round food thing.

07:56.484 --> 08:00.481
You're changing careers. No matter what
you do, you'll have to start at the bottom.

08:00.660 --> 08:04.760
It's gonna be years before you're making
anything near as much as you were before.

08:04.935 --> 08:07.702
So you're paying the check, right?

08:07.874 --> 08:12.076
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.
It's not like you have a family to support.

08:12.249 --> 08:16.019
Actually, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.186
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

08:19.898 --> 08:23.098
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

08:24.775 --> 08:27.941
I tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

08:29.985 --> 08:33.618
- I can just picture her on the bed.
- Stop!

08:35.162 --> 08:37.656
Wait. What do you mean
you're taking over my job?

08:37.834 --> 08:41.204
While you were on your baby vacation,
I was doing your job.

08:41.374 --> 08:44.541
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve..

08:44.715 --> 08:49.019
something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

08:49.525 --> 08:53.556
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise lsland.

08:56.404 --> 09:00.208
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because I'm back in two weeks.

09:00.379 --> 09:02.042
I want everything back
the way it was.

09:02.216 --> 09:05.678
I can't say I care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

09:05.857 --> 09:08.761
I can't say I care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

09:09.097 --> 09:14.301
- Excuse me?
- Rach, we have a code brown situation.

09:15.342 --> 09:17.973
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

09:18.616 --> 09:23.080
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

09:24.227 --> 09:25.992
Let me just get this straight.

09:26.164 --> 09:29.535
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

09:29.705 --> 09:33.805
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.177
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

09:36.351 --> 09:39.882
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here
from another department.

09:40.058 --> 09:42.928
And what department was that?
The jerk department?

09:43.131 --> 09:44.964
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

09:45.135 --> 09:48.666
Well, did they mention that
I'm rubber and you're glue?

09:49.377 --> 09:53.340
- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
- Hi, Mr. Zelner.

09:53.519 --> 09:55.385
Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

09:55.590 --> 09:58.619
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

09:58.796 --> 10:02.668
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin.

10:03.906 --> 10:05.397
Well, that's great.

10:05.610 --> 10:08.673
So now, Super Gavin,
when I come back..

10:08.849 --> 10:12.015
where do you plan on flying off to?

10:12.223 --> 10:16.027
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

10:16.431 --> 10:19.267
Super ass-kissing power.

10:19.905 --> 10:22.239
Incidentally, when are you coming back?

10:23.746 --> 10:24.839
Today.

10:25.048 --> 10:29.113
- You said two weeks.
- No, I said today.

10:29.290 --> 10:33.253
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.961
I'm sorry.
Rachel, we should probably go.

10:37.139 --> 10:40.441
I ran out of diapers,
and I had to use your sweater.

10:42.283 --> 10:46.314
- I didn't bring a sweater.
- Then, we should really go.

10:53.271 --> 10:55.298
So, what'd he say?

10:55.843 --> 10:58.211
He can be a little rough
around the edges..

10:58.381 --> 11:03.153
so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."

11:04.528 --> 11:09.766
So he said, "If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together..

11:09.938 --> 11:13.001
I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass."

11:13.913 --> 11:16.885
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.

11:17.086 --> 11:19.454
That's right. You're not.
You're a nurse.

11:19.624 --> 11:22.117
- You're Nurse With Tray.
- No, Joey..

11:22.329 --> 11:25.426
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

11:25.603 --> 11:29.269
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor..

11:29.443 --> 11:31.413
because if she doesn't, people die.

11:31.582 --> 11:33.380
Who dies?

11:33.552 --> 11:35.316
Man With Eye Patch!

11:35.489 --> 11:37.926
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.154
Yes, doctor.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.996
Okay, let's try this one more time.

11:44.173 --> 11:48.581
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.254
And, action.

11:58.268 --> 12:00.501
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

12:01.809 --> 12:02.970
What's next?

12:03.278 --> 12:05.613
The rest of the scene.

12:07.453 --> 12:09.218
Okay, from the top, people.

12:14.534 --> 12:20.341
Hey, you know what I was thinking? I don't
know if "code brown" is the best code word.

12:20.513 --> 12:24.008
I think people might know
what we're talking about.

12:24.186 --> 12:28.560
That's fine. Listen, sudden change of plans.
My maternity leave just ended.

12:28.729 --> 12:31.792
They said if I didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

12:31.969 --> 12:33.802
What? No, that's illegal.

12:33.973 --> 12:36.536
I'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't..

12:36.712 --> 12:42.383
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

12:42.557 --> 12:46.964
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

12:47.132 --> 12:50.195
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.

12:50.405 --> 12:53.434
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

12:53.612 --> 12:56.014
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

12:56.450 --> 13:00.015
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

13:01.628 --> 13:04.930
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.766
Fine. Fine.

13:07.941 --> 13:11.642
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we..

13:16.858 --> 13:18.326
Ross.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.058
You're pretty.

13:28.381 --> 13:32.082
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

13:32.422 --> 13:35.223
It's gonna be a while
before I make a living at it.

13:35.696 --> 13:39.898
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

13:40.071 --> 13:44.706
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

13:44.881 --> 13:45.906
Yeah.

13:47.887 --> 13:49.584
Goodbye.

13:53.264 --> 13:56.726
Okay, it's baby time.
Pants off, Bing.

13:58.876 --> 14:00.573
Didn't see you there, Geller.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.553
Ross is here, so..

14:07.794 --> 14:10.857
And I was really hoping
that maybe I could hang out.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.105
You know, what do you feel like doing?

14:16.177 --> 14:18.614
Well, we're gonna have sex.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.947
I don't feel like having sex.

14:25.028 --> 14:28.661
Maybe.. I don't know. Maybe we
can watch a movie or something.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.336
Let me put it this way:

14:30.506 --> 14:33.033
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

14:33.846 --> 14:35.611
Pants off, Bing.

14:39.858 --> 14:44.492
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to.

14:44.734 --> 14:48.674
Well, I've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NSYNC.

14:48.876 --> 14:50.641
Hey, they were popular when I left.

14:51.882 --> 14:54.444
I'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

14:54.687 --> 14:57.180
I should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

14:57.359 --> 15:00.229
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

15:00.398 --> 15:02.665
No. I see what you're
doing here, all right?

15:02.837 --> 15:07.244
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for
five years, and I know how it works.

15:07.513 --> 15:11.544
- So why don't you just catch me up.
- Fine.

15:11.721 --> 15:15.125
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.630
- How do you fix this?
- You've been here five years.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.604
- You figure it out.
- Fine, I will.

15:28.087 --> 15:29.579
All right, fill me in.

15:36.771 --> 15:40.437
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

15:40.613 --> 15:43.345
Yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.

15:43.552 --> 15:46.250
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete..

15:46.423 --> 15:49.590
and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.666
Hey, good morning, lover.

15:52.837 --> 15:56.469
I gotta say, after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.

15:59.617 --> 16:04.320
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

16:06.965 --> 16:07.990
Sorry.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.972
But I kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

16:13.144 --> 16:17.175
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

16:17.687 --> 16:19.155
You're not pregnant.

16:19.524 --> 16:20.856
What are you talking about?

16:21.226 --> 16:24.597
Well, that thing that I have to do
to make a baby?

16:24.767 --> 16:25.928
I faked it.

16:26.738 --> 16:29.072
What? You faked it?

16:30.078 --> 16:32.344
You know what?

16:33.885 --> 16:36.151
I don't need a tie.

16:37.392 --> 16:42.164
I mean, it's better open collar,
you know?

16:43.538 --> 16:46.168
It's more casual.

16:51.286 --> 16:54.452
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.

16:54.627 --> 16:58.430
Yesterday I was a nurse,
and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?

16:58.635 --> 17:02.096
Sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.

17:02.308 --> 17:06.977
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

17:07.152 --> 17:11.617
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

17:14.232 --> 17:17.637
Well, maybe you are a nurse..

17:17.807 --> 17:21.246
but you moonlight as a waitress.

17:25.756 --> 17:29.160
Because I'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

17:29.697 --> 17:31.165
Nice.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.135
Wait a minute.

17:34.339 --> 17:38.838
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

17:39.049 --> 17:43.149
No. No, see, you and Drake
are having a fight.

17:43.390 --> 17:44.916
About what?

17:45.094 --> 17:48.430
He slept with you..
Best sex you ever had, by the way.

17:50.572 --> 17:52.667
And then never called you.

17:52.843 --> 17:56.943
And I just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

17:58.487 --> 18:00.549
Okay. Okay, from the top.

18:00.993 --> 18:04.056
And, action.

18:04.232 --> 18:07.432
So I'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.110
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.043
Cut! Cut!

18:14.219 --> 18:15.654
What are you doing?

18:15.889 --> 18:20.057
I'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

18:20.264 --> 18:22.257
- Me too.
- Me too!

18:23.505 --> 18:25.805
Calm down. She means on the show.

18:25.976 --> 18:28.607
We need some new extras
around here.

18:32.255 --> 18:33.849
Wow. You're here already.

18:34.025 --> 18:38.466
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

18:38.635 --> 18:42.199
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.

18:42.408 --> 18:44.207
So ask me anything.

18:44.479 --> 18:47.474
- How do you fix the chair?
- Except that!

18:48.521 --> 18:53.019
Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

18:53.230 --> 18:58.070
- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.403
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

19:00.579 --> 19:03.414
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

19:03.585 --> 19:07.217
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping.

19:08.561 --> 19:12.125
But I love that man.
I'd follow him into hell.

19:12.703 --> 19:14.194
Microphones.

19:17.078 --> 19:19.378
Well, there you go, you win.
You win.

19:19.550 --> 19:22.522
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

19:22.690 --> 19:26.459
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter..

19:26.664 --> 19:30.194
and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

19:34.980 --> 19:38.282
- You can do the presentation.
- No, I can't. I have a baby.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.554
I'll watch her.

19:42.730 --> 19:43.925
Why would you do that?

19:44.299 --> 19:48.968
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

19:50.144 --> 19:51.841
That's really nice.

19:52.448 --> 19:55.979
I should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

19:56.156 --> 19:59.687
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

20:02.268 --> 20:04.762
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:05.374 --> 20:06.809
God.

20:07.311 --> 20:09.178
Thank you. Thank you.

20:15.194 --> 20:18.565
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.519
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

20:34.432 --> 20:37.268
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

20:37.438 --> 20:40.274
- Okay, but this is her last chance.
- Thank you.

20:40.444 --> 20:42.677
How about I do something for you?

20:42.850 --> 20:45.947
Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

20:49.964 --> 20:52.959
Listen, Phoebe. I was just talking
to the director..

20:53.170 --> 20:56.165
and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

20:56.343 --> 20:57.778
You just wait on the tables.

20:58.146 --> 21:00.982
I can't do that. I'm an actor.
I have a process.

21:01.186 --> 21:04.591
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

21:06.162 --> 21:08.690
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

21:08.868 --> 21:09.995
What?

21:10.170 --> 21:13.610
I'm so good in the scene
that I'm stealing focus from you.

21:13.811 --> 21:17.045
Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.

21:17.218 --> 21:18.447
Come join me up here.

21:20.592 --> 21:23.427
- Okay, great. I will.
- Okay, good.

21:27.471 --> 21:31.138
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would
call security. She won't go easy.

21:33.885 --> 21:36.982
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

21:37.191 --> 21:41.188
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

21:43.170 --> 21:44.867
Guys can fake it?

21:45.040 --> 21:47.978
Unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.521
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

21:53.691 --> 21:56.355
Well, that's actually why.

21:57.164 --> 21:59.498
Look, I'm starting
a whole new career now.

21:59.670 --> 22:01.697
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

22:01.874 --> 22:05.335
I'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

22:05.515 --> 22:06.915
Like a month?

22:07.853 --> 22:11.087
- Or a year?
- Really? You wanna wait a year?

22:11.259 --> 22:14.390
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.

22:14.566 --> 22:19.702
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

22:22.549 --> 22:24.883
It'll probably be more than a year.

22:28.193 --> 22:32.395
- I really wanna have a baby.
- Well, yeah, me too.

22:35.107 --> 22:38.443
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

22:38.614 --> 22:41.084
No, I want you to have
a job that you love..

22:41.419 --> 22:44.824
not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

22:45.027 --> 22:47.760
I quit, and you learn what I do?

22:50.672 --> 22:54.612
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.875
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while..

22:57.051 --> 23:00.148
you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

23:00.324 --> 23:02.955
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this..

23:03.130 --> 23:07.366
but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.572
I guess.

23:10.779 --> 23:13.717
I mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

23:13.885 --> 23:16.321
It's gonna be really scary.

23:16.489 --> 23:19.427
I mean, God, when we have a baby..

23:19.596 --> 23:23.160
there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

23:23.805 --> 23:27.711
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

23:27.913 --> 23:30.680
I won't have time to clean it.

23:31.319 --> 23:34.018
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer..

23:34.192 --> 23:36.857
and messes up all the ribbons?

23:37.031 --> 23:39.194
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer..

23:39.368 --> 23:41.771
because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

23:41.941 --> 23:44.104
Where will all the ribbons go?

23:45.414 --> 23:47.817
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

23:47.986 --> 23:49.819
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.894
And I promise I will not
fake it this time.

23:53.063 --> 23:56.365
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.

24:01.379 --> 24:03.714
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.

24:03.885 --> 24:08.087
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.991
I don't care if you are my brother.

24:10.899 --> 24:12.994
I'm not your brother.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.105
What about my children, Drake?

24:15.440 --> 24:17.410
No! No! No!

24:22.087 --> 24:23.750
God!
