WEBVTT

00:57.123 --> 00:58.681
No, no, we're done!

01:01.261 --> 01:03.388
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

01:47.273 --> 01:49.639
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

01:49.843 --> 01:52.778
If you'd told me <br/>vegetarian lasagna...

01:52.979 --> 01:55.447
... I would've made <br/>vegetarian lasagna.

01:56.883 --> 02:00.580
The meat's only every third layer. <br/>Maybe you could scrape.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.513
Ross, did you really read <br/>all these baby books?

02:04.724 --> 02:08.820
You could plunk me down in <br/>any woman's uterus, no compass...

02:09.696 --> 02:12.256
...and I could find my way <br/>out like that!

02:13.233 --> 02:14.325
This is cool.

02:14.567 --> 02:18.901
It says in some parts of the world <br/>people eat the placenta.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.902
And we're done with the yogurt.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.668
Sorry.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.679
I did this as a favor. <br/>I am not a caterer.

02:29.916 --> 02:33.352
What do you want me to do <br/>with a dozen lasagnas?

02:34.053 --> 02:36.317
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.552
You kiss Uncle Freddie <br/>with that mouth?

02:40.493 --> 02:45.453
Ross, listen. Do you know that right <br/>now your baby is only this big?

02:45.665 --> 02:47.758
This is your baby. <br/>" Hi, Daddy. "

02:48.301 --> 02:49.290
Hello.

02:49.802 --> 02:52.669
" How come you don't live with Mommy? "

02:54.240 --> 02:57.368
" How come Mommy lives <br/>with that other lady? "

03:02.081 --> 03:04.242
"What's a lesbian? "

03:09.222 --> 03:11.383
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

03:11.591 --> 03:16.119
Poconos. It's like " poke a nose. "

03:18.064 --> 03:21.090
Poke a nose.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.903
-So did I hear Poconos? <br/>-Yes.

03:32.111 --> 03:35.410
My sister's giving us her place <br/>for the weekend.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.344
First weekend together.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.916
-It's a big step. <br/>-I know.

03:40.820 --> 03:45.314
-It's just a weekend. Big deal. <br/>-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

03:45.625 --> 03:47.149
Shouldn't it be...

03:47.527 --> 03:49.256
...flung by now?

03:49.996 --> 03:52.157
We are way past a "fling. "

03:52.365 --> 03:56.392
I' m feeling things I've read about <br/>in Danielle Steel books.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.470
When l' m with him, <br/>l' m just totally....

03:59.739 --> 04:02.435
Nauseous. <br/>I' m physically nauseous.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.968
What am I supposed to do? <br/>Call lmmigration?

04:07.847 --> 04:09.678
I could call lmmigration.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.119
What?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.918
Ugly Naked Guy is making <br/>shadow puppets.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.695
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.597
Oh, right!

04:26.899 --> 04:29.459
Go. Go!

04:34.741 --> 04:38.336
I love babies with <br/>their little baby shoes...

04:38.544 --> 04:42.537
...and their little baby toes <br/>and their little hands....

04:42.782 --> 04:46.343
Okay, you' re gonna have to stop that. <br/>Forever.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.896
Need a new table.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.758
You think?

05:07.206 --> 05:09.299
-Come on in. <br/>-Hello.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.042
I brought the books...

05:11.544 --> 05:14.911
...and Monica sends her love <br/>along with this lasagna.

05:15.114 --> 05:19.278
Great! Is it vegetarian? <br/>Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.551
I' m pretty sure that it is.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.857
Nineteen weeks, the breasts <br/>are starting to swell.

05:33.132 --> 05:35.293
According to the literature.

05:35.501 --> 05:39.198
-I got the results of the amnio. <br/>-T ell me. Is everything...?

05:39.405 --> 05:43.432
-T otally and completely healthy. <br/>-That is great!

05:48.881 --> 05:51.611
When did you and Susan <br/>meet Huey Lewis?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.876
That's our friend T anya.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.894
Of course, it's your friend T anya.

06:08.267 --> 06:11.998
-Don't you wanna know about the sex? <br/>-The sex?

06:13.539 --> 06:17.805
I' m having enough trouble with <br/>the image of you and Susan together.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.137
But when you throw in T anya....

06:23.015 --> 06:25.483
The sex of the baby, Ross.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.645
You know the sex of the baby?

06:31.090 --> 06:32.489
-Want to know? <br/>-No.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.019
I don't want to. Absolutely not.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.220
You shouldn't know until <br/>you look down there...

06:38.498 --> 06:40.432
...and see, " Oh, there it is. "

06:41.100 --> 06:42.499
Or isn't.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.738
-Hello, Ross. <br/>-Susan.

06:47.974 --> 06:48.963
So?

06:49.675 --> 06:50.903
So did you hear?

06:51.177 --> 06:53.270
Yes, we did. <br/>Everything's A-Okay.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.970
Oh, that's so cool!

06:57.350 --> 06:58.647
It really is.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.177
Do we know?

07:00.486 --> 07:03.387
We certainly do. <br/>It's going to be a

07:03.623 --> 07:04.612
Hello?

07:04.824 --> 07:08.453
A guy who doesn't wanna know <br/>is standing here.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.823
Well, is it what <br/>we thought it would be?

07:19.505 --> 07:21.097
What?

07:21.541 --> 07:23.372
What did we think it'd be?

07:24.210 --> 07:26.735
I don't wanna know. <br/>Don't wanna know.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.810
I should probably just go.

07:29.248 --> 07:32.775
-Well, thanks for the books. <br/>-No problem. Okay.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.182
Susan.

07:42.628 --> 07:47.065
Who should we call first? <br/>Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

07:50.837 --> 07:52.202
Hello?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.470
Never mind. <br/>I don 't wanna know.

07:57.543 --> 08:01.070
Because it was my table, <br/>I have to buy a new one?

08:01.280 --> 08:05.148
-That's the rule. <br/>-What rule? There's no rule.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.843
-You owe me a table. <br/>-How did you get there?

08:09.055 --> 08:14.083
It was fine until your breakfast <br/>adventure with Angela Delvecio.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.018
You knew about that?

08:16.229 --> 08:20.529
The impressions in the butter <br/>left little to the imagination.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.235
How about if we split it?

08:24.136 --> 08:27.230
-What do you mean, buy it together? <br/>-Yeah.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.769
-Do you think we' re ready for that? <br/>-Why not?

08:31.978 --> 08:35.937
It's a big commitment. <br/>What if one of us wants to move out?

08:36.148 --> 08:38.275
-You' re moving out? <br/>-l' m not.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.850
-You'd tell me if you were, right? <br/>-Yes.

08:41.053 --> 08:45.490
-It's just, with my last roommate <br/>-I know all about Kip.

08:45.691 --> 08:50.788
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off <br/>and got married. Things got ugly.

08:50.997 --> 08:55.661
Let me ask you something. <br/>Was Kip a better roommate than me?

08:56.068 --> 08:57.865
Oh, don't do that.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.970
There's changes in your schedule.

09:06.178 --> 09:09.272
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:30.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.541
And Miss Summerfield <br/>canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

09:12.885 --> 09:13.977
Thanks.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.182
Oh, here comes your 3:00.

09:16.589 --> 09:20.184
I don't mean to sound unprofessional, <br/>but Yum!

09:24.397 --> 09:27.491
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.769
Rachella tell me you...

09:33.506 --> 09:34.495
... massage?

09:34.974 --> 09:37.272
Well, Rachella's right.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.242
Oh, okay.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.711
I don't know what you just said, <br/>so let's start.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.413
I am...

09:50.423 --> 09:52.414
... being naked?

09:52.858 --> 09:56.521
That's your decision. <br/>Some people prefer to take off

09:58.631 --> 09:59.825
Being naked!

10:01.233 --> 10:05.226
I can't believe you don't <br/>wanna know. I couldn't not know.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.271
If the doctor knows, <br/>Carol and Susan know

10:08.741 --> 10:10.140
And Monica knows.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.171
How? I don't even know.

10:13.379 --> 10:16.837
Carol called to thank me <br/>for the lasagna. She told me.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.946
So what's it gonna be?

10:22.154 --> 10:26.648
-Oh, great! Now he knows. <br/>-l' m just excited about being an aunt.

10:26.859 --> 10:29.384
Or an uncle.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.726
-Hey, Phoebe. <br/>-Hey, Pheebs.

10:35.935 --> 10:36.959
Fine!

10:40.139 --> 10:43.802
-What's the matter? <br/>-Nothing. I' m just out of sorts.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.707
Well, you can use some of my sorts. <br/>I rarely use them.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.708
Can we get some cappuccino <br/>over here?

10:52.251 --> 10:53.912
Oh, right! That's me!

10:55.488 --> 10:58.548
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.984
Fine.

11:01.894 --> 11:02.952
What is it?

11:04.296 --> 11:08.232
-All right. You know Paolo? <br/>-l' m familiar with his work.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.263
He made a move on me.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.997
-The store will be open tomorrow. <br/>-More coffee, please.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.232
Well, what happened?

11:18.511 --> 11:22.572
He came in for a massage, <br/>and everything was fine until....

11:26.786 --> 11:28.686
-Oh, my God. <br/>-Are you sure?

11:30.289 --> 11:32.450
Oh, yeah. I' m sure.

11:36.162 --> 11:40.292
And all of a sudden, his hands <br/>weren't the problem anymore.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.559
Was it...?

11:45.771 --> 11:48.968
Boy Scouts could've camped <br/>under there.

11:52.678 --> 11:53.702
Wow.

11:53.946 --> 11:57.609
-What did you do? <br/>-I dealt with it like a professional.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.614
" Ooh, " what?

12:05.858 --> 12:06.916
ma Thurman.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.219
-The actress! <br/>-Uma Thurman!

12:10.496 --> 12:11.485
Thanks, Rach.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.867
-What'll you do? <br/>-You have to tell her.

12:17.069 --> 12:21.733
It's your moral obligation as a friend, <br/>as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

12:21.941 --> 12:22.965
Guys?

12:23.275 --> 12:26.608
-You have to. <br/>-Feminist issue? That's where I went.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.615
-She is gonna hate me! <br/>-Yeah, well....

12:38.991 --> 12:41.255
Will you pick one? <br/>Just pick one.

12:41.460 --> 12:45.419
-Here, how about that one? <br/>-That's patio furniture.

12:45.998 --> 12:50.401
So what? Like people will come in <br/>and think, " Oh, l' m outside again. "

12:50.603 --> 12:51.695
Fine.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.738
What about the birds?

12:55.141 --> 12:59.942
I don't know. They don't say, <br/>" Hello, sit here. Eat something. "

13:01.046 --> 13:04.174
-You pick one. <br/>-Okay. How about the ladybugs?

13:04.450 --> 13:08.580
Forget about the birds, but big red <br/>insects suggest fine dining.

13:09.021 --> 13:13.219
-Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds! <br/>-Not like that, I won't.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.694
Kip would have liked the birds.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.443
-Hi, Pheebs. <br/>-What's going on?

13:31.644 --> 13:35.239
-Are you moving out? <br/>-l' m getting ready for the weekend.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.712
Are your weekends longer <br/>than two days?

13:40.419 --> 13:42.444
These aren't all my suitcases.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.087
This one's Paolo's.

13:47.426 --> 13:51.328
-Rachel, can we talk for a sec? <br/>-Well, sure.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.930
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.974
We haven't known each other that long.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.911
There are three things <br/>you should know:

14:12.117 --> 14:16.577
One, my friends are the most <br/>important thing in my life.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.653
Two, I never lie.

14:19.458 --> 14:23.792
And three, I make the best <br/>oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.862
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.530
-Oh, my God! <br/>-I know.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.969
Why have I never tasted these?

14:39.211 --> 14:44.046
I don't make them a lot, because <br/>it's not fair to the other cookies.

14:50.189 --> 14:53.181
These are the best <br/>oatmeal raisin cookies.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.086
-Which proves that I never lie. <br/>-I guess you don't.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.064
Paolo made a pass at me.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.663
What do you think?

15:03.869 --> 15:06.736
It's the most beautiful table <br/>I've seen.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.133
I know.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.138
Will you balance plates <br/>on these heads?

15:11.377 --> 15:14.005
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink. <br/>Come on!

15:16.382 --> 15:17.872
Heads up, Ross.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.381
Score! You suck!

15:23.522 --> 15:24.853
Are you okay?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.257
I need some mik.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.031
Okay. I've got milk.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.435
Here you go.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.480
Better?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.344
No.

15:54.787 --> 16:00.054
I feel so stupid! I think about <br/>the other day with you guys.

16:00.326 --> 16:03.887
And I was all, " Oh, Paolo! <br/>He's so great!

16:04.129 --> 16:05.824
He makes me feel so"

16:06.632 --> 16:07.792
God!

16:08.434 --> 16:10.026
I' m so embarrassed!

16:10.269 --> 16:11.793
I' m so embarrassed.

16:12.004 --> 16:15.440
-l' m the one he hit on. <br/>-I unleashed him on you.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.472
If I had never met him

16:17.710 --> 16:19.769
-l' m so sorry. <br/>-No, l' m sorry.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.309
-l' m sorry. <br/>-l' m sorry. Wait.

16:22.614 --> 16:25.105
-What are we sorry about? <br/>-I don't know.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.375
Right. He's the pig.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.316
-Such a pig! <br/>-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

16:30.556 --> 16:33.992
He's like a big disgusting pig....

16:34.293 --> 16:36.557
-Pig man! <br/>-Yes, good!

16:40.799 --> 16:43.893
But he was my pig man!

16:45.104 --> 16:47.265
How did I not see this?

16:48.841 --> 16:49.967
Oh, I know!

16:53.078 --> 16:54.340
Because...

16:55.114 --> 16:56.581
... he's gorgeous.

16:56.882 --> 16:58.406
And he's charming.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.380
-And when he looks <br/>-Okay, Pheebs.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.111
The end.

17:05.491 --> 17:06.480
God.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.586
Should I not have told you?

17:11.363 --> 17:14.696
T rust me, it's much better <br/>that I know.

17:17.936 --> 17:21.929
But I just liked it better before. <br/>It was better.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.649
She took it pretty well. <br/>Paolo's over there now, so....

17:42.028 --> 17:46.328
We should go and see if she's okay. <br/>Just one second.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.065
-Score! <br/>-Game! Nice!

17:52.372 --> 17:53.566
Come on, Pheebs.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.177
Well, it looks like we <br/>kicked your butts.

17:58.378 --> 18:02.508
She did. You could be on the Olympic <br/>"Standing There" team.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.182
Come on. Two on one.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.012
Why are you here? <br/>She just broke up with him.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.518
It's time for you to swoop in.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.920
-What, now? <br/>-Yes. Now is when you swoop.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.994
When Paolo walks out, <br/>you gotta be the first guy she sees.

18:17.230 --> 18:21.963
She's gotta know you' re everything <br/>he's not. You' re the anti-Paolo.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.637
My Catholic friend is right.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.433
She's distraught. <br/>You' re there for her.

18:28.641 --> 18:34.443
You pick up the pieces and then <br/>you usher in "The Age of Ross. "

18:41.321 --> 18:43.949
-See this? See? <br/>-Hold it! Ascolta!

18:47.327 --> 18:49.227
-How's it going? <br/>-Don't stare.

18:49.429 --> 18:54.389
She threw his clothes off the balcony. <br/>Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

18:54.601 --> 18:58.196
That is, " How could you? " <br/>or " Enormous breasts! "

19:00.206 --> 19:01.935
Here he comes.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.649
I am...

19:14.354 --> 19:15.844
...to say goodbye.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.812
Okay, bye-bye.

19:21.294 --> 19:26.630
Paolo, I really hate you for what you <br/>did, but I still have five of these...

19:26.833 --> 19:29.768
...so heat it at 375 <br/>until the cheese bubbles.

19:34.474 --> 19:39.537
I just wanna tell you, and I think <br/>I'd speak for everyone when I say....

19:45.919 --> 19:47.853
Oh, just look at her.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.646
Guys, I think only one of us <br/>should go...

19:50.857 --> 19:53.189
-...so she's not overwhelmed. <br/>-Right.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.861
And I really think it should be me.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.045
You all right?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.915
I've been better.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.116
I don't believe this.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.880
I wasn't supposed to care <br/>about this guy.

20:24.090 --> 20:28.789
It was just supposed to be <br/>this big, fun, ltalian thing.

20:29.529 --> 20:34.489
Someday I could look back and say, <br/>"That was a big, fun, ltalian thing. "

20:35.902 --> 20:39.599
It wasn't supposed to feel <br/>like this when it was over.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.202
Come here.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.906
Listen...

20:52.118 --> 20:55.178
...you deserve <br/>so much better than him.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.379
I mean, you...

20:57.724 --> 21:01.820
...should be with a guy who knows <br/>what he has when he has you.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.622
What?

21:07.567 --> 21:10.263
I' m so sick of guys!

21:10.970 --> 21:15.634
I don't want to look at <br/>or think about another guy.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.970
I don't even want <br/>to be near another guy.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.613
Ross, you' re so great.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.534
-Are you all right? <br/>-Are you okay?

21:42.735 --> 21:46.501
-Medium. Any cookies left? <br/>-Yeah.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.940
See, Rach...

21:51.144 --> 21:55.547
... I don't think swearing off guys <br/>altogether is the answer.

21:55.748 --> 22:00.276
What you need is to develop a more <br/>sophisticated screening process.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.784
I just need to be by myself <br/>for a while.

22:04.991 --> 22:08.483
-I just gotta figure out what I want. <br/>-No, no.

22:09.395 --> 22:13.354
See, because not all guys out there <br/>are gonna be a Paolo.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.500
No, I know. I know.

22:15.702 --> 22:19.832
And l' m sure your little boy's <br/>not gonna grow up to be one.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.866
-What? <br/>-What?

22:25.511 --> 22:26.773
I' m having a boy?

22:27.814 --> 22:29.338
No.

22:30.083 --> 22:33.575
No. In fact, you' re not having a boy.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.950
I' m having a boy.

22:37.523 --> 22:41.152
-Huh? Am I having a boy? <br/>-You' re having a boy!

22:41.728 --> 22:42.956
I' m having a boy!

22:43.162 --> 22:45.221
-l' m having a boy! <br/>-What is it?

22:45.431 --> 22:48.059
I' m having a boy! <br/>I' m having a boy!

22:51.804 --> 22:53.499
We already knew that!

22:56.776 --> 22:58.539
I' m having a son.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.382
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

23:09.589 --> 23:10.817
Shutout!

23:14.293 --> 23:16.887
Where you going? One more game!

23:17.096 --> 23:20.293
-It's 2:30 in the morning. <br/>-Yeah, get out!

23:20.800 --> 23:23.792
You guys always hang out <br/>in my apartment.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.437
I'll only use my left hand.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.663
Come on, wussies!

23:32.512 --> 23:34.742
All right! Okay! I gotta go!

23:35.248 --> 23:36.442
I' m going.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.316
And l' m gone.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.917
-One more game? <br/>-Oh, yeah.
