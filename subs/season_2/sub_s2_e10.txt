WEBVTT

00:05.372 --> 00:09.331
Slow down! The will not be
sold out at 1:00 in the morning.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.137
I'm excited!
I've never got reviewed before!

00:12.346 --> 00:15.907
You were so amazing as the king!
I'm really impressed.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.378
Although you know what?

00:17.584 --> 00:20.075
You might wanna concider wear
underwear next time.

00:20.654 --> 00:24.021
When you sat on the throne,
you could see your...

00:24.258 --> 00:25.850
... royal subjects.

00:26.350 --> 00:28.650
Come on, no one wear underwear back then.

00:28.650 --> 00:31.350
I am sure the critic will appreciate your authority.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.361
Nice gender, by the way!

00:34.361 --> 00:36.361
Thanks man!

00:36.361 --> 00:37.556
Here it is! Here it is!

00:38.163 --> 00:41.724
"The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction...

00:41.967 --> 00:46.802
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king."

00:47.239 --> 00:49.469
Okay, look.
That is one guy's opinion.

00:49.708 --> 00:52.336
All right?
Pheebs, read yours.

00:52.544 --> 00:56.173
"The only thing worse than
the mindless, adolescent direction"

00:56.381 --> 00:58.406
Anybody have one from a different paper?

01:00.018 --> 01:01.212
Ross, read yours.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.252
I don't want to.

01:05.252 --> 01:07.252
The only enjoyable moment ¡­¡­

01:07.352 --> 01:10.156
¡­¡­was when the king has been
hanged and he can speak no more.

01:11.056 --> 01:14.423
Joey, they don't know
what they're talking about.

01:14.927 --> 01:15.916
Maybe they do.

01:16.195 --> 01:20.291
I've done this 10 years and I'm
nowhere. There's gotta be a reason.

01:20.532 --> 01:22.864
Come on, you're just
paying your dues.

01:23.068 --> 01:25.161
No, no, no. It's too hard.

01:25.371 --> 01:27.305
It's not worth it. I quit.

01:27.539 --> 01:28.767
Come on, Joey!

01:28.974 --> 01:31.374
Wait, wait one minute.
Wait a minute.

01:31.610 --> 01:34.306
I believe this will change your mind.

01:34.546 --> 01:39.245
"ln a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani
achieved brilliant levels of

01:39.551 --> 01:41.610
Continued on page 153.

01:42.421 --> 01:43.615
sucking."

01:45.090 --> 01:47.081
The One With Russ

02:30.081 --> 02:32.881
It there anything else you ever wanna to be?

02:34.902 --> 02:36.893
I used to want to be a vet.

02:37.105 --> 02:40.541
Then I found out you have
to put your hands into cows.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.869
Are you okay?

02:47.115 --> 02:49.777
Just a tough day at work, you know?

02:50.018 --> 02:52.248
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

02:55.189 --> 02:57.919
I know this jacket.
This is Fun Bobby's jacket!

02:58.126 --> 03:00.253
Where is he?
He's here, isn't he?

03:00.528 --> 03:02.257
-Maybe.
-Don't toy with me.

03:02.764 --> 03:03.594
Geller!

03:03.798 --> 03:05.425
Hey, Fun Bobby!

03:05.700 --> 03:07.531
Hey! You been working out?

03:07.769 --> 03:08.758
Not at all.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.460
I love this guy!

03:11.939 --> 03:14.305
I'm so excited to hear
you're back with my sister.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.635
-You and me both!
-So what'd I miss?

03:16.878 --> 03:19.244
We were trying
to make Joey feel better.

03:19.947 --> 03:21.244
Need me to pick you up?

03:21.749 --> 03:23.239
No, I'm all right, man.

03:23.451 --> 03:24.782
No, I'm picking you up!

03:25.053 --> 03:27.283
No, seriously.
I don't need you to

03:29.991 --> 03:31.288
It still works!

03:31.559 --> 03:34.653
Before I go, does anybody else
need to be picked up?

03:36.064 --> 03:37.463
I'm still gonna go.

03:38.399 --> 03:39.730
See you later, babe.

03:41.836 --> 03:45.636
Public display of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

03:52.980 --> 03:53.844
See you.

03:55.483 --> 03:57.075
Fun Bobby is so great.

03:57.285 --> 03:58.411
Oh, isn't he?

03:58.653 --> 04:03.317
I think this time it may work with him.
He makes me feel so good.

04:03.524 --> 04:06.857
I've been feeling so lousy lately.
No job, no boyfriend.

04:07.095 --> 04:09.359
Well, at least my cup is half full.

04:10.098 --> 04:12.157
Half full of love!

04:14.702 --> 04:18.433
For our two-week anniversary,
he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.

04:18.673 --> 04:20.641
Cabin of love!

04:22.777 --> 04:25.041
We went through
a lot of wine tonight.

04:25.313 --> 04:26.541
I only had two glasses.

04:26.781 --> 04:27.770
I had a glass.

04:28.015 --> 04:28.879
Two.

04:29.117 --> 04:29.981
I had one glass.

04:30.184 --> 04:31.549
I had a mug full in this...

04:31.819 --> 04:34.845
... I-got-boned-at-the-
Museum-of-Natural-History mug.

04:36.791 --> 04:39.282
Okay, so that's what?
Two bottles.

04:39.527 --> 04:41.961
And yet somehow we went through five?

04:54.709 --> 04:57.872
So what?
So he drank a lot tonight.

04:58.312 --> 05:00.746
Now that I think about it,
I don't think...

05:01.015 --> 05:03.813
...I've ever seen Fun Bobby
without a drink.

05:05.553 --> 05:09.216
And did you notice how
he always starts his stories with...

05:09.423 --> 05:14.156
... "Okay, I was so wasted!"
or "Oh, we were so bombed!"

05:14.362 --> 05:17.331
"So I wake up and I'm in
this dumpster in Connecticut!"

05:19.500 --> 05:22.230
Have you been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

05:22.436 --> 05:26.167
We just happen to go to a lot
of places where you might drink.

05:26.374 --> 05:29.571
How do you go to a wine-tasting
without having a drink?

05:30.011 --> 05:32.411
Or to a club, or to the...

05:32.747 --> 05:33.941
...zoo.

05:38.886 --> 05:40.945
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

05:41.756 --> 05:43.781
I don't know, taste it.

05:47.728 --> 05:49.593
Too late, you already had some.

05:53.067 --> 05:56.298
What do you say
we make these coffees lrish?

06:00.041 --> 06:01.065
Cake!

06:02.443 --> 06:05.037
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

06:07.548 --> 06:11.609
It seems like you've been making
an awful lot of stuff "lrish" lately.

06:11.886 --> 06:16.220
I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles
are hard to get into that flask.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.316
Yeah, okay.

06:20.161 --> 06:24.325
Maybe it's none of my business.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

06:25.266 --> 06:26.494
I'm worried about you.

06:27.568 --> 06:31.971
This isn't the first time somebody
said something to me about this.

06:32.173 --> 06:35.836
But I always made excuses,
like "I'm just a social drinker."

06:36.110 --> 06:38.578
Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"

06:40.681 --> 06:42.478
So, what are you saying now?

06:44.018 --> 06:45.849
I guess I'm saying...

06:46.120 --> 06:47.485
... I'll try and quit.

06:48.089 --> 06:49.852
I like that you worry about me.

06:53.527 --> 06:55.495
So, what's going on?

06:55.930 --> 06:58.091
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

06:58.299 --> 06:59.823
Oh! Why?

07:06.974 --> 07:08.441
Guess who's back in show biz!

07:09.844 --> 07:10.811
Lorne Greene?

07:13.547 --> 07:15.640
No. You know why?
Because he's dead.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.145
Oh, no.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.518
This is gonna seem bittersweet now...

07:21.722 --> 07:23.781
... but Joey, that's who!

07:25.226 --> 07:28.127
My agent called with an audition
for Days Of Our Lives!

07:28.896 --> 07:29.726
Kick ass!

07:38.632 --> 07:42.033
We have to celebrate!
We should do a soap opera theme.

07:42.302 --> 07:45.703
We could all sleep together,
then one of us could get amnesia!

07:49.910 --> 07:52.640
When do you get off?
We'll do something tonight.

07:53.480 --> 07:57.211
Well, actually, I'm already done.
But I kind of got plans.

07:58.351 --> 07:59.875
You have other friends?

08:02.389 --> 08:03.879
I have a date.

08:04.090 --> 08:04.920
What?

08:08.158 --> 08:09.090
With a man?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.494
No, with Crule John.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.724
What's so strange
about me having a date?

08:15.724 --> 08:16.930
With Crule John.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.358
What about Ross?

08:20.564 --> 08:23.055
You're still mad
because he made that list?

08:23.267 --> 08:25.701
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

08:25.903 --> 08:28.463
I'm not really "anything"
at him anymore.

08:28.773 --> 08:31.207
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.372
Whatever I was feeling, I'm...

08:35.613 --> 08:36.443
... not.

08:36.647 --> 08:38.308
But you guys came so close.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.575
I'm sorry. You'll have
to get used to the fact...

08:41.786 --> 08:43.879
...that I will not be dating Ross.

08:45.890 --> 08:46.982
Here he is.

08:48.559 --> 08:50.823
Guys, this is Russ.

09:12.908 --> 09:16.139
I'm not saying you're not talented.
You're very talented.

09:16.378 --> 09:20.314
But with the bird dead and all,
there's very little act left.

09:20.882 --> 09:23.180
Honey, give me a break, will you?

09:23.385 --> 09:24.750
I'll talk to you later.

09:24.953 --> 09:26.784
There's my favorite client!

09:27.055 --> 09:29.615
So tell me, darling,
how was the audition?

09:29.891 --> 09:33.827
I think it went well.
I got a callback for Thursday.

09:34.062 --> 09:37.122
Joey! Have you ever
seen me ecstatic?

09:38.567 --> 09:40.125
Well, here it is.

09:44.439 --> 09:48.307
Okay! Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

09:48.510 --> 09:49.602
The casting lady

09:49.811 --> 09:51.836
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

09:52.114 --> 09:53.012
She's great.

09:54.783 --> 09:59.152
But I kind of got the feeling that
she was sort of coming on to me.

09:59.421 --> 10:03.755
And I definitely would get the part
if I were to, you know....

10:07.963 --> 10:10.591
If I sent the little general in.

10:13.001 --> 10:16.801
I see! Well, I'm just gonna
put in a call here...

10:17.005 --> 10:20.634
...and we'll find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

10:21.676 --> 10:23.143
Lori, please.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.043
Hi, darling!

10:27.349 --> 10:30.318
How about Joey Tribbiani
for the part of the cab driver?

10:30.519 --> 10:32.282
Isn't he terrific?

10:36.825 --> 10:38.725
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

10:39.294 --> 10:41.387
You're gonna have to sleep with her.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.298
-What's the matter?
-Fun Bobby.

10:47.502 --> 10:48.833
What? Isn't he sober?

10:49.037 --> 10:50.470
Oh, he's sober all right.

10:50.705 --> 10:53.401
Turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.644
All right, here you go, sweetie.

11:01.483 --> 11:04.008
Thanks. You wanna
hear something funny?

11:04.252 --> 11:05.844
Oh, God, yes!

11:07.522 --> 11:11.822
There are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

11:14.896 --> 11:16.488
That is funny.

11:17.599 --> 11:22.366
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out
walking around the neighborhood.

11:22.366 --> 11:27.366
and I am walking, and I am walking, and I am walking

11:28.366 --> 11:30.771
So you are saying you are walking

11:30.771 --> 11:31.965
But apparently...

11:32.406 --> 11:37.139
...there are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

11:41.139 --> 11:44.139
So it's help for fat ¡­¡­

11:44.139 --> 11:46.139
¡­¡­as well as funny.

11:51.615 --> 11:53.776
Don't you have to
be at your interview?

11:53.885 --> 11:54.715
Oh, yeah.

11:58.089 --> 11:59.215
See you guys.

11:59.423 --> 12:00.321
Bye...

12:01.159 --> 12:03.218
...ridiculously dull Bobby.

12:04.695 --> 12:06.026
Oh, my God.

12:06.230 --> 12:07.527
He's not that bad.

12:07.732 --> 12:11.691
Not that bad?
Did you not hear the hammer story?

12:11.903 --> 12:14.064
Okay, don't get all squinky.

12:15.773 --> 12:18.571
Maybe it's the kind of story
where you had to be there.

12:18.776 --> 12:20.175
But I'm gonna be there!

12:20.378 --> 12:22.744
For the rest of my life.

12:24.282 --> 12:27.877
I can't dump him. I made him
quit drinking. I made him dull!

12:28.085 --> 12:29.279
Don't say that.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.853
He's probably always been dull.
You just, you know...

12:33.090 --> 12:34.387
...set it free.

12:36.928 --> 12:37.758
Hey, Ross.

12:40.398 --> 12:41.365
Hi, Russ.

12:41.599 --> 12:44.727
I've got two more tables
to clean, and then we'll go.

12:44.936 --> 12:47.200
I'll just sit here and...

12:47.605 --> 12:49.470
...chat with your...

12:50.408 --> 12:53.468
...friend-type people.

12:58.883 --> 12:59.747
Rachel?

13:02.019 --> 13:04.283
So, you know what
you're doing, right?

13:05.022 --> 13:06.182
Waitressing?

13:06.424 --> 13:08.915
Well, yeah. But, no.
I mean....

13:09.693 --> 13:12.662
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

13:14.598 --> 13:15.792
Bob Saget?

13:16.367 --> 13:17.299
Oh, yeah!

13:18.602 --> 13:20.194
No, no, no!

13:21.372 --> 13:22.532
Oh, my, oh!

13:23.507 --> 13:24.337
What's wrong?

13:26.210 --> 13:27.472
She's upset because...

13:27.678 --> 13:30.647
...she buttered a spider
into her toast this morning.

13:32.516 --> 13:33.676
All right.

13:35.953 --> 13:38.547
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

13:39.056 --> 13:40.990
Ross, Russ.
Russ, Ross.

13:45.129 --> 13:47.188
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

13:47.398 --> 13:48.456
Yes. Yes, I am.

13:48.666 --> 13:51.294
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

13:51.535 --> 13:54.402
Actually, I'm kind of a...

13:54.705 --> 13:55.797
...you know...

13:56.340 --> 13:58.900
...a date-type thing...

13:59.543 --> 14:00.407
...of Rachel's.

14:01.412 --> 14:02.709
A date?

14:03.314 --> 14:04.508
I'm her date.

14:04.715 --> 14:06.512
Oh! Oh, you're a....

14:06.717 --> 14:09.311
Oh, you're the date.

14:09.753 --> 14:11.050
This is actually good...

14:11.255 --> 14:13.917
... because if we lose Ross,
we have a spare.

14:14.892 --> 14:17.417
Oh! You are the paleontologist.

14:17.995 --> 14:21.055
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are a....

14:23.100 --> 14:23.930
Periodontist.

14:24.268 --> 14:27.260
See? Now they're as
different as night and...

14:28.105 --> 14:29.595
...Iater that night.

14:30.174 --> 14:33.803
Well, I am going to get a beverage.

14:34.011 --> 14:36.070
It was nice meeting you.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.269
Ditto.

14:43.621 --> 14:44.952
Well, I met Russ.

14:47.691 --> 14:50.455
Hey, I didn't know
we were seeing other people.

14:50.928 --> 14:53.897
Well, we're not
seeing each other, so....

14:54.698 --> 14:57.599
For your information,
there's a woman at the museum...

14:57.801 --> 15:00.770
...who's curator of moths and other...

15:02.072 --> 15:02.936
...winged things...

15:05.276 --> 15:09.372
...who's let it be known that
she is drawn to me, much like a...

15:09.580 --> 15:10.410
...you know.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.815
I've kept her at bay,
but if this is the deal

15:15.052 --> 15:16.280
This is the deal.

15:16.487 --> 15:18.478
Okay, well, have a nice evening.

15:19.390 --> 15:20.721
Russ, you ready?

15:27.965 --> 15:29.432
She's dating?

15:30.100 --> 15:31.124
She's dating?

15:31.335 --> 15:34.429
Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

15:35.272 --> 15:36.136
What do you mean?

15:36.774 --> 15:38.503
-Do you not see it?
-See what?

15:38.742 --> 15:41.506
I don't know what she sees
in that goober!

15:44.348 --> 15:47.408
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know...

15:47.651 --> 15:50.085
... hello, a week
to get out a sentence?

15:51.255 --> 15:52.620
It's annoying, isn't it?

16:08.872 --> 16:10.601
You didn't get the part...

16:10.808 --> 16:13.208
...or ltaly called
and said it was hungry?

16:14.044 --> 16:15.944
The part's mine if I want it.

16:16.580 --> 16:17.478
Oh, my God!

16:17.748 --> 16:20.444
If I'm willing to sleep
with the casting lady.

16:20.718 --> 16:21.878
Oh, my...

16:22.086 --> 16:23.246
...God?

16:24.455 --> 16:28.221
Ten years I've been waiting
for a break like this. Ten years!

16:28.459 --> 16:32.122
I mean, Days of our Lives.
That's actually on television!

16:33.063 --> 16:34.496
What are you gonna do?

16:34.732 --> 16:37.166
I guess I could sleep with her.
I mean....

16:37.434 --> 16:38.799
How can I do that?

16:39.069 --> 16:42.835
I've got a pop-up book that told me
everything I need to know.

16:43.674 --> 16:45.801
I've never slept
with someone for a part.

16:46.010 --> 16:47.170
Well, is she

16:49.513 --> 16:50.480
Sorry.

16:51.949 --> 16:53.644
Is she good-looking?

16:53.917 --> 16:57.148
She's totally good-looking.
If I met her in a bar...

16:57.421 --> 16:59.685
... I'd be buying her breakfast.

17:01.592 --> 17:03.423
After having slept with her.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.260
Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

17:11.468 --> 17:16.371
The way that I see it is, you get a
great job, and you get to have sex!

17:17.174 --> 17:20.166
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas!

17:24.548 --> 17:27.847
I just don't think that
I want it that way, though.

17:28.052 --> 17:30.520
I mean, let's say
I do make it, all right?

17:30.788 --> 17:34.952
I'll always look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent or...

17:35.192 --> 17:37.023
...you know, the little general.

17:39.730 --> 17:42.665
Didn't you used to call it
"the little major"?

17:42.900 --> 17:45.368
After Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

17:51.341 --> 17:52.865
Something from the bar?

17:53.077 --> 17:54.840
Yes, I would like something.

17:55.879 --> 17:57.938
No. No, thank you.

17:58.148 --> 18:01.879
If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.
I've gotta get used to it.

18:02.086 --> 18:04.850
No, no, really.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

18:05.222 --> 18:06.587
Just some water, please.

18:07.324 --> 18:10.851
-So my refrigerator light's out.
-Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

18:13.864 --> 18:16.196
We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.764
Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?

18:21.839 --> 18:23.101
Eleven letters...

18:23.574 --> 18:27.169
...atomic element number 101,
ends in "ium."

18:27.511 --> 18:28.443
Dysprosium.

18:29.179 --> 18:30.510
Dysprosium.

18:30.748 --> 18:32.215
Try mendelevium.

18:32.549 --> 18:34.676
And weenie number two has it.

18:35.452 --> 18:39.252
Unless "Knights in White Satin"
was sung by the Doody Blues.

18:43.227 --> 18:45.752
You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?

18:45.963 --> 18:46.861
What?

18:47.364 --> 18:49.195
Honey, you're dating Ross.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.094
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.769
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

18:53.971 --> 18:55.370
Steve, sleeve.

18:56.306 --> 18:58.069
No one is named sleeve.

18:58.909 --> 19:00.809
What are you talking about?

19:01.044 --> 19:05.105
Other than their names being similar,
I do not see what you're seeing.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.976
For your information...

19:07.217 --> 19:09.481
...it's a card sharp,
not a card shark.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.278
You could not be more wrong.

19:11.555 --> 19:14.046
You could try,
but you would not be successful.

19:14.958 --> 19:19.224
I'm gonna get some more coffee before
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

19:21.131 --> 19:22.325
I know your problem.

19:22.599 --> 19:23.793
Oh, you do, do you?

19:24.501 --> 19:25.331
You're jealous.

19:28.138 --> 19:29.605
Of what?

19:29.907 --> 19:32.307
You're jealous
because I'm a real doctor.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.141
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

19:36.346 --> 19:38.837
That's the smallest body part
you can major in.

19:40.484 --> 19:43.044
Day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.

19:43.253 --> 19:44.311
You listen here

19:44.555 --> 19:46.386
-Let me finish.
-No, let me finish.

19:46.590 --> 19:48.558
No, you let me fin

20:02.339 --> 20:04.534
Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

20:05.175 --> 20:06.608
I don't even think he knew.

20:06.844 --> 20:09.404
Would you sleep with somebody
to get a great job?

20:09.780 --> 20:12.112
Who would I have to sleep with?

20:12.349 --> 20:13.407
Me.

20:16.086 --> 20:17.713
Why with you?

20:17.921 --> 20:20.185
It's my game.
You want the job or not?

20:23.861 --> 20:24.759
Good morning.

20:25.028 --> 20:26.120
Where you going?

20:26.363 --> 20:29.355
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

20:30.701 --> 20:32.293
What's with all the liquor?

20:40.269 --> 20:42.669
What's going on?
Is Bobby drinking again?

20:42.972 --> 20:45.338
This is not for him.
This is for me.

20:46.809 --> 20:50.472
That way, he's sober but his
shoelace stories are more amusing.

20:55.852 --> 20:58.446
God! Even his knock is boring!

21:01.123 --> 21:04.320
-I'll be ready in a second.
-Could I talk to you?

21:04.527 --> 21:05.357
Sure.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.991
This is hard for me to say.

21:09.265 --> 21:10.994
You fell off the wagon!

21:11.200 --> 21:12.360
Oh, no, no.

21:12.935 --> 21:13.799
It's about you.

21:14.437 --> 21:15.529
What about me?

21:16.105 --> 21:18.335
I think you may have
a drinking problem.

21:21.711 --> 21:22.939
What, these?

21:23.846 --> 21:26.474
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

21:27.783 --> 21:31.844
Look, I'm not strong enough to be
in a codependent relationship.

21:33.222 --> 21:34.621
Oh, shoot.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.295
Well, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

21:44.834 --> 21:45.698
Take care.

21:45.902 --> 21:48.370
-You too.
-Goodbye.

21:51.841 --> 21:52.967
What happened?

21:55.077 --> 21:56.203
We kind of broke up.

22:03.419 --> 22:04.886
Does anybody want these?

22:05.154 --> 22:06.348
I'll take one.

22:07.356 --> 22:10.814
Sometimes I hold stuff like this
and pretend I'm a giant.

22:16.432 --> 22:18.093
How'd the callback go?

22:18.334 --> 22:22.065
It was unbelievable. I walked
in there and she was all over me.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.364
-What did you do?
-I couldn't do it.

22:24.574 --> 22:26.439
I didn't want the part that way.

22:26.676 --> 22:27.506
Good for you!

22:27.710 --> 22:29.268
But wait!
I left her office...

22:29.512 --> 22:33.608
...and she caught up with me
and offered me a bigger part.

22:34.016 --> 22:34.948
So, and?

22:36.619 --> 22:41.113
So, you are now looking at
Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

22:41.357 --> 22:43.917
... recurring in
at least four episodes!

22:45.194 --> 22:47.025
All right, I gotta go shower.

23:03.245 --> 23:05.679
I guess you guys heard
Rachel dumped me.

23:05.915 --> 23:07.348
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.348
She said I remind her
too much of somebody.

23:10.553 --> 23:12.384
Any idea who
she's talking about?

23:14.323 --> 23:16.985
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

23:18.928 --> 23:20.486
She hates him.

23:22.098 --> 23:23.224
Hey, Julie!

23:23.532 --> 23:25.056
How are you doing?

23:25.267 --> 23:28.430
I don't know. It's weird
not being with Ross...

23:28.671 --> 23:30.764
... but I guess I'm doing okay.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.838
Actually, I've got some
of his stuff that he....

23:42.038 --> 23:44.438
-Have we met?
-I don't think so.

23:44.438 --> 23:46.038
You look so familiar.

23:47.838 --> 23:52.538
May be we can talk about it
over a cup of coffee.

23:52.538 --> 23:57.538
You know what I'm sick of coffe.
Let's go and get some juice.

23:58.038 --> 24:02.738
all right! bye!
