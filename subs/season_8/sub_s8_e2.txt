WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:05.695
Listen, sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.

00:05.906 --> 00:09.137
We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts
from the minibar.

00:09.309 --> 00:13.075
And we did not watch
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

00:15.549 --> 00:19.679
-Joey, were you in our room last night?
-No.

00:27.494 --> 00:31.328
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.

00:32.165 --> 00:37.364
-We're checking out of the bridal suite.
-That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

00:37.538 --> 00:41.770
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.077
And I'm the happiest guy in the world.

00:47.180 --> 00:50.581
Honey, don't be upset. We still have
so much to look forward to.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.150
Yeah, right.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.345
-We got the honeymoon.
-That's not till Thursday.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.013
-The wedding pictures.
-It won't be ready for weeks.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.751
Not the disposable cameras
from the tables.

01:00.928 --> 01:04.022
That's true.
I knew I married you for a reason!

01:04.531 --> 01:08.262
Tell you what, I will go get them
developed, and you can go home.

01:11.638 --> 01:15.005
-What? What did you take a picture of?
-Nothing.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.836
It was something.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.607
Ross has the cameras.
Has he checked out yet?

01:20.781 --> 01:24.012
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

01:24.184 --> 01:28.450
-And he has a good 11 minutes left.
-So?

01:28.622 --> 01:31.921
So Ross had never checked out of a room
a minute before he had to.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.923
One time, when we were dating,
we got a late checkout.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.531
He got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.

01:38.832 --> 01:42.427
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

01:43.704 --> 01:48.004
Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross,
get the cameras and get them developed.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.743
32, Joe. You're 32!

01:55.115 --> 01:57.549
-Here's a copy of your bill.
-Thanks.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.114
Champagne, strawberries..

02:01.688 --> 02:06.853
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.530
Yeah, that's sad.
Mashuga Nut?

02:52.806 --> 02:55.707
I have six minutes left!

02:55.876 --> 02:57.138
It's me.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.610
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this stuff?

03:05.786 --> 03:08.812
Why not?
It's built into the price of the room.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.717
Yeah, but you don't need..
What is this?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.622
Thread.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.454
Score!

03:18.465 --> 03:21.866
-Where are the disposable cameras?
-What cameras?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.027
-Last night I asked you to take them.
-No, you didn't.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.504
Yes, remember?
Right before we cut the cake, I said..

03:28.675 --> 03:31.166
Yeah, you asked me
if I could do you a favor.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.438
Then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.879
Then you said, "Why is it called a check?
Why not a Yugoslavian?"

03:42.322 --> 03:46.019
Then you did that,
and my Uncle Murray looked at me like:

03:47.561 --> 03:50.052
-So you don't have the cameras?
-No, sorry.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.926
So, what? They're gone?
Monica's gonna freak!

03:53.100 --> 03:56.001
I'm sure they're here somewhere.
I'll help you look.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.398
-Great.
-In three minutes.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.456
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

04:19.626 --> 04:22.652
No! I'm just..

04:23.897 --> 04:28.891
They're calling out to me.
This little guy even crawled up in my lap.

04:29.302 --> 04:34.069
Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just
one present. What do you think it is?

04:34.241 --> 04:37.438
A little mirror that,
when you look into it..

04:37.611 --> 04:40.409
you see yourself as an old woman.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.846
A tiny salt shaker!

04:45.018 --> 04:48.920
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

04:49.089 --> 04:53.253
Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.
That was fun.

04:53.426 --> 04:56.759
Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.

04:58.398 --> 05:03.859
Although, you know, this is part
of a salt-and-pepper set.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.571
It may just count as only half a present.
What do you think?

05:07.741 --> 05:12.110
I guess it's okay to open one more if it's
part of a set. It's probably this one.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.042
Or this one!

05:17.651 --> 05:21.849
-How are you? Got any morning sickness?
-The guys don't know yet, do they?

05:22.022 --> 05:25.514
Joey and Ross don't know anything.
Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.855
That's right.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.163
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling
or offered to carry my bags.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.666
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.766
After you, of course.

05:40.974 --> 05:44.432
Don't worry. You only have to be
pregnant for a few more hours..

05:44.611 --> 05:46.545
because I'm telling the father today.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.739
Is it someone in the building?
That tall guy on the first floor?

05:49.916 --> 05:53.682
-No!
-What? I think he's cute.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.187
-Then you have his baby.
-Believe me, I'm trying.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.892
It's so weird.
You're gonna tell this guy today..

06:02.062 --> 06:04.656
and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

06:04.831 --> 06:09.859
You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.494
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.434
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.309
Yeah, well, I guess
it is pretty big news.

06:21.481 --> 06:24.780
Pretty big? It's huge!
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.

06:24.951 --> 06:29.911
He's just walking down the street thinking,
"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"

06:30.123 --> 06:33.524
Then, bam! He's a father,
everything's different.

06:33.693 --> 06:37.857
It's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.090
He still has this huge decision
to make.

06:40.267 --> 06:44.363
Now he's walking around thinking,
"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!

06:44.537 --> 06:46.300
What was that "bam"?

06:46.473 --> 06:50.170
I don't know.
He's hit by a bus, or something.

06:52.545 --> 06:57.949
Joey, what would you do if someone you
slept with told you she was pregnant?

07:04.224 --> 07:05.953
Who called here?

07:07.460 --> 07:11.920
Did she sound blond? Did she have
an accent? I gotta make a call.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.090
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

07:16.169 --> 07:19.297
It's not you!
You didn't get anybody pregnant.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.975
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.479
Is somebody pregnant?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.481
Oh, yeah! That's me.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.878
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

07:37.057 --> 07:41.926
Yes, I am.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

07:42.862 --> 07:45.763
-Wait a minute, who's the father?
-You don't know him.

07:45.932 --> 07:50.460
It's not important. He wants nothing
to do with me or the baby.

07:53.807 --> 07:58.972
Who is this guy? Because I will
track him down and kick his ass!

07:59.779 --> 08:02.577
-David Linn.
-David Linn!

08:06.119 --> 08:10.112
-Who's David Linn?
-Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.723
-Chandler?
-Did you find the cameras?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.627
-No. Did you?
-Yes.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.860
That's why I'm under the table,
celebrating.

08:24.738 --> 08:29.038
I checked in the lost and found. I talked
to the manager. No one's turned them in.

08:29.209 --> 08:34.146
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.112
You just got married.
Why is she so depressed?

08:37.283 --> 08:41.617
All my energy is going
into not asking that question.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.849
-I can't believe I screwed this up!
-I'm sorry, man.

08:48.094 --> 08:52.121
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

08:52.298 --> 08:55.790
There's a band. There's gonna be
plenty of dressed-up people.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.097
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

08:59.272 --> 09:02.901
No, I'm saying we buy more of these
at the gift shop..

09:03.076 --> 09:05.601
throw our tuxes back on
and take a few pictures.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.714
We just have to make sure
not to get anybody's faces.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.372
Are you serious?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.916
I'm thinking about
your new bride at home.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.249
Do you want to start your life together
by letting her down?

09:16.423 --> 09:19.483
Marriage advice? Really?

09:21.494 --> 09:24.622
I'm telling you,
this looks exactly like your wedding.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.995
-Aren't these the same flowers?
-I don't know. Monica picked them.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.329
-What about the chairs?
-Those too.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.266
-The place settings?
-Her.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.602
-What did you do?
-I was in charge of the cameras.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.504
Gift shop?

09:43.316 --> 09:46.615
-Did you do it yet?
-Not yet.

09:46.786 --> 09:50.517
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

09:50.690 --> 09:52.521
Is it Gunther?

09:54.527 --> 09:58.861
-It's not Gunther!
-Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.801
The father is not here, okay?
I haven't told him yet.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.406
-I don't think I can tell him at all now.
-Why not?

10:07.574 --> 10:13.308
I was walking down the street, thinking,
"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!

10:14.481 --> 10:16.005
Bus?

10:17.117 --> 10:22.419
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.920
But it is huge.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.526
I know. But I was just thinking about
how huge it was for me.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.561
I didn't even go to how huge it'll be
for the father.

10:30.730 --> 10:35.326
You're thinking about this way too much.
Just tell him and get it over with.

10:35.502 --> 10:39.734
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.806
Oh, mother of..!

10:44.177 --> 10:45.804
See?

10:51.251 --> 10:56.484
-Are we opening presents?
-No. I shouldn't have even opened these.

10:56.956 --> 11:01.655
Joey, I am out of control!
You have to do me a favor.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.160
No matter what I say,
no matter what I do..

11:04.330 --> 11:07.390
please, do not let me open
another present. Okay?

11:10.803 --> 11:12.634
Give me one more.

11:15.975 --> 11:19.934
Oh, good, you're here.
Pheebs? Listen..

11:20.213 --> 11:23.740
-Sit down, I got something I wanna say.
-All right.

11:30.657 --> 11:36.118
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

11:36.329 --> 11:40.095
I've always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.756
So..

11:43.503 --> 11:46.666
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

11:50.476 --> 11:52.569
Oh, my God!

11:54.781 --> 11:57.272
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

11:58.785 --> 12:03.347
-You can't marry him!
-Hey, lady, your day's over. It's my turn.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.958
-Why can't she marry me?
-I can and I will.

12:09.796 --> 12:14.130
She's not pregnant.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.200
Oh, my God!

12:17.003 --> 12:19.733
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!

12:19.906 --> 12:21.965
It's Joey!

12:23.042 --> 12:24.737
I love you.

12:26.713 --> 12:31.412
Wait, I can't believe it!
Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.176
We don't know.

12:35.521 --> 12:38.922
-I wonder if it's that dude.
-There's a dude?

12:39.125 --> 12:40.592
Who is it?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.957
About a month ago
this guy spent the night with Rachel.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.598
I didn't see who it was, but..

12:52.138 --> 12:54.129
Was that story over?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.979
The guy left this.

13:00.413 --> 13:04.782
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.848
People have got
to finish their stories.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.558
Hello.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.307
I don't know if we're both in.
Come closer.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.673
Nice aftershave.

13:31.844 --> 13:35.211
If you want some,
I've got eight mini bottles in my bag.

13:35.581 --> 13:39.176
-Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?
-Of course.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.791
Would you take one of us?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.550
Yeah, sure.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.252
Click.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.926
-It didn't click.
-I heard it.

13:55.101 --> 13:58.537
-But there was no flash.
-Why won't you take our picture?

13:58.705 --> 14:01.367
Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.304
Your finger was covering the lens.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.470
Who are you, Ansel Adams?
Get out of here!

14:12.752 --> 14:16.586
Look, I feel really bad about
how I freaked you out before..

14:16.756 --> 14:19.919
so I asked the father to meet you here
so you could tell him.

14:20.126 --> 14:24.153
What? Wait a minute.
How do you even know who the father is?

14:24.397 --> 14:27.594
I may play the fool at times..

14:27.767 --> 14:32.397
but I'm more than a pretty blond girl
with an ass that won't quit.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.567
I believe this belongs
to the father of your baby..

14:37.744 --> 14:42.841
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

14:43.015 --> 14:48.851
You can turn around, or you can go rip
the Band-Aid off. What do you want to do?

14:50.990 --> 14:52.582
-Let's rip.
-Are you sure?

14:52.759 --> 14:55.159
-Phoebe!
-Okay. Sorry.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.622
Hey, Rach.

15:06.773 --> 15:10.903
Why don't you go up on-stage.
I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.

15:28.661 --> 15:32.791
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk?

15:32.965 --> 15:35.229
Your car is about to be towed.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.964
That's my car!

15:41.340 --> 15:44.241
-A '95 LeSabre?
-Yes.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.235
-A green LeSabre?
-Yes!

15:49.982 --> 15:53.816
-I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
-Yes, green-blue.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.550
Well, go. Go move it!

16:01.060 --> 16:05.121
Ready for the last picture?
Get ready to run.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.430
Congratulations on your wedding.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.806
So, what's this about?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.506
Rachel has something
she wants to tell you.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.950
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

16:29.121 --> 16:33.217
No, this is my red sweater.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.428
Oh, no.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.290
Could I get anyone a coffee?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.737
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.205
What's going on, Rach?

16:50.376 --> 16:54.745
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

16:55.047 --> 17:00.110
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?

17:00.720 --> 17:04.053
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.525
I know we broke up because you thought
I was immature, but I've grown up.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.996
I think we should get back together.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.828
It's just not the right time.

17:18.004 --> 17:22.805
It is the right time.
I'm ready for more.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.341
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.572
I'm having a baby.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.184
-You can go.
-Thank you.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.265
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

17:48.601 --> 17:52.503
-You opened them all?
-I know, I am a terrible person.

17:52.672 --> 17:56.540
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.703
You got my parents' gift.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.678
-What is that?
-I think it does something to salami.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.219
-How'd it go?
-What did Tag say?

18:09.388 --> 18:12.789
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

18:12.959 --> 18:16.918
I do, Rach, I do.
And I am so happy for you.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.126
Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

18:25.471 --> 18:31.034
-So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
-I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.

18:31.210 --> 18:35.146
No matter what this guy says,
you're not gonna be alone in this.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.181
-I'm not?
-No. Listen..

18:41.554 --> 18:46.890
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

18:47.059 --> 18:52.395
I've always felt like you and I have
this special bond, you know?

18:52.565 --> 18:55.090
-Rachel Greene, will you marry me?
-What?

18:55.267 --> 18:57.326
-What?
-What?!

18:58.537 --> 19:01.199
-Pheebs, give me the ring back.
-No!

19:01.674 --> 19:07.806
Joey, you're so sweet, so sweet, honey.
But I'm not looking for a husband.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.309
I understand.

19:15.955 --> 19:20.289
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.731
What? I proposed to you.
It balances out.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.070
I can't say that didn't hurt.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.513
But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.141
-Listen, about that, I only offered..
-Ooh, a Salami Buddy!

19:47.319 --> 19:48.786
There you go!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.150
-We're back!
-Great.

19:52.324 --> 19:55.816
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.327
-It's picture time.
-You're gonna love these.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.694
Here's a picture of Ross.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.437
And that's me.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.936
And that's me and Ross.

20:10.576 --> 20:14.444
And here's a picture of our first kiss
as a married couple.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.912
Wow, that is a great picture. Yeah!

20:18.084 --> 20:22.453
And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.189
Didn't see that coming.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.420
So this isn't a picture
of our first kiss..

20:31.597 --> 20:35.624
but it is a picture
of my first kiss with this lady.

20:37.336 --> 20:41.932
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
you'll remember, so there's no need..

20:44.076 --> 20:48.137
-I'll take the real pictures to get developed.
-Good idea.

20:52.451 --> 20:56.387
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.853
You kissed another woman?!

21:00.359 --> 21:02.020
-Call it even?
-Okay.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.128
-I'm gonna go get these in some water.
-You stole those from that wedding?

21:13.305 --> 21:17.571
No, the hotel lobby. They think they can
charge me for some dirty movie..

21:17.743 --> 21:21.201
and a bag of Mashuga Nuts,
they got another thing coming!

21:24.817 --> 21:27.047
Hey, my sweater!

21:29.722 --> 21:32.623
I've been looking for this
for, like, a month.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.498
Oh, my God!

21:46.572 --> 21:48.164
Oh, my God!

21:54.947 --> 21:58.906
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. Long time no see.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.516
-Like your sweater.
-Right back at you.

22:05.624 --> 22:11.085
-It's crazy about Rachel.
-Well, she's one crazy lady.

22:11.831 --> 22:16.734
-So whose is it?
-I don't know, some Italian guy.

22:18.270 --> 22:22.502
Come on, read your own label.
See you later. He is so weird.
