00:02.447 --> 00:04.278
<i>We learned one thing, Cheese:</i>

00:04.516 --> 00:07.974
<i>Cheerleaders and high explosives</i>
<i>don't mix.</i>

00:10.455 --> 00:12.355
<i>You can say that again, Mac.</i>

00:12.558 --> 00:15.118
<i>I couldn't have done it alone.</i>
<i>You're a genius.</i>

00:15.360 --> 00:20.457
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can't get</i>
<i>my VCR to stop blinking 1 2:00?</i>

00:27.339 --> 00:28.829
What did you guys think?

00:33.412 --> 00:35.846
-Hey, the phone.
-I got it. I got it.

00:37.049 --> 00:38.539
HoId on. It's your mom.

00:38.817 --> 00:40.682
-It's Mommy.
-That's nice.

00:40.919 --> 00:43.080
Ma. So, what did you think?

00:44.056 --> 00:45.216
WeII...

00:45.657 --> 00:48.023
...that was okay.

00:48.293 --> 00:49.590
It wasn't the best.

00:49.828 --> 00:52.319
That was one
of the worst things ever...

00:53.599 --> 00:56.067
...and not just on TV.

00:56.668 --> 00:59.000
-What shouId we say?
-The Iighting was okay.

00:59.237 --> 01:02.331
You got Iighting Iast time.
Lighting is mine.

01:02.808 --> 01:03.832
I have costumes.

01:04.076 --> 01:05.509
That means I'm stuck with:

01:05.744 --> 01:10.875
''So we were watching you in there
and you were sitting right here.''

01:12.017 --> 01:14.042
-What about you?
-I don't know.

01:14.319 --> 01:17.584
I can't Iie to him again.
Oh, no, I-- No.

01:17.856 --> 01:20.586
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.190
-And say nothing?
-Yeah, that's right.

01:26.198 --> 01:28.257
My foIks reaIIy Iiked it.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.023
What did you guys think?

01:36.775 --> 01:38.208
It wasn't that good.

01:41.213 --> 01:43.340
The One With RacheI's Assistant

02:19.217 --> 02:22.983
Do you think that your favorite animaI
says much about you?

02:23.255 --> 02:25.018
You mean behind my back?

02:26.725 --> 02:29.819
You'II never beIieve
what happened to me today.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.189
-I am sitting in my office--
-You guys!

02:32.397 --> 02:34.092
Guess what my agent just said?

02:34.366 --> 02:36.061
I'm in the middIe of a story here.

02:36.334 --> 02:37.665
Sorry, you finish.

02:37.903 --> 02:40.770
I'm sitting in my office,
and guess who waIks in.

02:41.106 --> 02:43.074
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.

02:43.341 --> 02:44.365
That's great.

02:45.343 --> 02:47.277
-Joey.
-You weren't finished?

02:47.546 --> 02:50.743
Yeah, ''Guess who waIks
into my office'' is my story.

02:51.783 --> 02:53.910
RaIph Lauren waIked into my office.

02:54.186 --> 02:57.849
If you're starting another story,
at Ieast Iet me finish mine.

02:59.124 --> 03:00.614
It's the same story.

03:01.259 --> 03:03.693
It's reaIIy Iong.

03:04.396 --> 03:08.093
RaIph just came in to teII me
that he's so happy with my work...

03:08.366 --> 03:12.427
...that he wants me to be the new
merchandising manager for PoIo retaiI.

03:12.738 --> 03:14.729
-StiII get a discount on wedding gowns?
-Yeah.

03:15.006 --> 03:17.031
I'm so happy for you.

03:18.543 --> 03:20.807
These reaIIy are
the ''days of our Iives.''

03:22.114 --> 03:24.139
-What?
-WeII, since you ask....

03:24.416 --> 03:27.010
They want me back on
<i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

03:27.219 --> 03:28.652
I get a big pay raise!

03:28.887 --> 03:30.013
Oh, hey!

03:30.255 --> 03:33.713
I'II be pIaying Drake Ramoray's
twin brother, Stryker.

03:34.626 --> 03:37.060
I get to hire my own assistant.

03:38.764 --> 03:41.426
I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

03:47.239 --> 03:49.070
You were at this job four years?

03:49.307 --> 03:53.767
-That's right.
-This is aII very impressive, HiIda.

03:54.045 --> 03:56.275
I just have one Iast <i>q</i>uestion for you:

03:57.649 --> 03:59.344
How did I do? Was this okay?

04:00.685 --> 04:02.915
-What?
-I've never interviewed anyone.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.248
I've never had anyone work for me.

04:05.490 --> 04:08.789
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

04:09.094 --> 04:11.289
No, dear, it's not.

04:12.297 --> 04:13.787
And I know that.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.193
WeII, thank you so much for coming in.

04:17.469 --> 04:19.460
-Nice to meet you.
-Good meeting you.

04:19.704 --> 04:21.103
AII right.

04:22.607 --> 04:24.199
I'm a totaI pro.

04:25.510 --> 04:27.978
HeIIo.

04:29.714 --> 04:32.478
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The modeIs are down the haII.

04:32.717 --> 04:34.981
I'm here about the assistant job.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.514
ReaIIy?

04:37.122 --> 04:41.149
Okay, weII, then, aII right.
WeII, just have a seat there.

04:41.393 --> 04:42.690
So, what's your name?

04:42.994 --> 04:44.018
Tag Jones.

04:44.296 --> 04:46.093
Go on.

04:47.232 --> 04:49.223
That's it. That's my whoIe name.

04:49.501 --> 04:51.526
That's your whoIe name.
Of course it is.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.502
Okay, Iet's just have a Iook-see here.

04:54.739 --> 04:58.470
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much e<i>x</i>perience--

04:58.710 --> 05:02.806
What are you taIking about?
You got three years painting houses...

05:03.415 --> 05:06.976
...two whoIe summers
at TGI Friday's.

05:07.686 --> 05:08.880
It's Iame, I know.

05:09.154 --> 05:11.987
But I'm a goaI-oriented person,
eager to Iearn--

05:12.190 --> 05:14.055
Just hoId on a second, pIease.

05:18.563 --> 05:22.624
It's for human resources. Everybody
has to. WouId you stand up?

05:30.742 --> 05:32.209
No, no, no.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.517
Hey.

05:49.361 --> 05:52.023
-Anyway, I shouId go.
-Okay. Bye.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.027
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hi, sweetie.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.291
What was with aII the whispering?

05:56.701 --> 05:58.760
I can't teII you. It's a secret.

05:59.204 --> 06:02.765
Secret? Married peopIe aren't
supposed to have secrets.

06:03.041 --> 06:05.669
We Iove and respect
one another too much.

06:07.679 --> 06:08.703
But stiII, no.

06:09.581 --> 06:13.711
We shouId teII each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

06:13.919 --> 06:18.413
ReaIIy? So teII me what happened
to Ross junior year at DisneyIand.

06:18.690 --> 06:20.385
No, I can't do that.

06:21.092 --> 06:23.117
I'II teII you what Phoebe said.

06:23.929 --> 06:24.953
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:25.230 --> 06:27.562
So Ross and I
are going to DisneyIand.

06:27.799 --> 06:29.960
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

06:30.235 --> 06:34.831
When I say ''restaurant,'' I mean a guy,
a hibachi and the trunk of his car.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.505
So Ross has about 1 0 tacos.

06:37.776 --> 06:42.304
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feeI a IittIe iffy.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.138
Oh, my God. He threw up?

06:44.416 --> 06:47.817
No, he visited a town
a IittIe south of throw up.

06:48.753 --> 06:50.448
-No.
-Yeah.

06:50.622 --> 06:53.614
Some of the empIoyees decided
to rename the park...

06:53.792 --> 06:55.692
...the ''Crappiest PIace on Earth.''

06:59.197 --> 07:00.926
What was Phoebe's secret?

07:01.099 --> 07:05.126
Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
oId massage pIace, is getting fired.

07:09.107 --> 07:12.201
That's it? I gave up my
DisneyIand story for that?

07:12.610 --> 07:15.135
That's right. You Iose, sucker!

07:17.716 --> 07:19.308
PIease stiII marry me.

07:23.254 --> 07:25.154
You have an assistant, right?

07:25.423 --> 07:26.447
Did she caII?

07:26.725 --> 07:30.525
You toId her I was sick, right?
AIways teII her I am sick.

07:31.429 --> 07:34.125
No, I just don't know,
how do you decide who to hire?

07:34.332 --> 07:36.027
I have it down to two peopIe.

07:36.301 --> 07:39.327
One has great references
and a Iot of e<i>x</i>perience.

07:39.537 --> 07:41.971
-And then there's this guy....
-What about him?

07:43.608 --> 07:44.836
I Iove him.

07:46.745 --> 07:48.736
He's so pretty I want to cry.

07:48.947 --> 07:50.312
I don't know what to do.

07:50.548 --> 07:54.143
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

07:54.352 --> 07:59.016
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're <i>q</i>uaIified.

08:02.460 --> 08:06.794
I hear you. You make a Iot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

08:07.032 --> 08:08.260
Look how pretty.

08:10.335 --> 08:11.359
Let me see.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.361
Oh, my God.

08:14.873 --> 08:16.898
Oh. But no.

08:17.175 --> 08:20.372
No. You can't hire him,
because it's not professionaI.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.171
This is for me, yes?

08:25.016 --> 08:28.144
Okay, you're right.
I'II hire HiIda tomorrow.

08:28.386 --> 08:31.150
Dumb, oId, perfect-for-the-job HiIda.

08:31.923 --> 08:32.981
Let me see.

08:37.162 --> 08:39.187
Don't show this to Monica.

08:39.397 --> 08:41.831
And don't teII her about the:

08:49.074 --> 08:50.507
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Terry.

08:50.742 --> 08:52.937
-Nice to see you again.
-Been a whiIe.

08:53.178 --> 08:56.011
Funny, these haIIs Iook smaIIer
than they used to.

08:56.714 --> 08:58.579
It's a different buiIding.

08:59.818 --> 09:00.876
So...

09:01.386 --> 09:03.616
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?

09:03.888 --> 09:06.118
-When do I start?
-How about right now?

09:06.391 --> 09:07.756
Okay.

09:08.359 --> 09:10.452
Here are the audition scenes.

09:14.099 --> 09:16.624
I thought you
were offering me the part.

09:16.901 --> 09:17.959
Why?

09:18.203 --> 09:21.730
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

09:21.973 --> 09:24.464
Who Iooks more Iike me than me, right?

09:25.143 --> 09:27.771
Everybody has to audition.

09:29.647 --> 09:32.582
You know, Terry,
I don't reaIIy need to do this.

09:32.784 --> 09:35.480
I got my own cabIe TV series...

09:35.787 --> 09:37.584
...with a robot.

09:39.090 --> 09:41.888
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.057
WeII...

09:44.896 --> 09:47.228
...I guess you think
you're pretty speciaI.

09:47.465 --> 09:50.923
Sitting up here in your fancy,
smaII-haIIed buiIding...

09:52.570 --> 09:55.004
...making stars jump
through hoops for you.

09:55.273 --> 09:56.763
WeII, you know what?

09:58.643 --> 10:01.441
This is one star whose hoop--

10:01.679 --> 10:03.874
This is the star the hoop--
This hoop--

10:04.115 --> 10:06.083
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

10:13.758 --> 10:16.283
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

10:16.528 --> 10:19.964
I came to thank you for not Iaughing
in my face yesterday.

10:20.198 --> 10:23.634
I noticed there aren't any pIants,
so I brought you your first--

10:24.135 --> 10:26.160
There is a pIant in your office.

10:27.005 --> 10:28.404
Kind of.

10:29.107 --> 10:31.803
-And that was there yesterday, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

10:31.976 --> 10:34.877
I got it the same time I got that one.

10:35.780 --> 10:36.872
Right.

10:37.348 --> 10:41.250
So I guess I shouIdn't put
''good at noticing stuff'' on my résumé.

10:41.786 --> 10:43.777
-Thank you.
-Anyway...

10:44.122 --> 10:46.090
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.

10:46.758 --> 10:47.952
WeII....

10:48.359 --> 10:49.587
Gotcha.

10:49.994 --> 10:52.087
Thanks again for meeting with me.

10:53.965 --> 10:55.227
But I hired you.

10:57.168 --> 10:59.159
-What?
-Yeah, you got the job.

10:59.404 --> 11:01.395
-You're my new assistant.
-I am?

11:01.639 --> 11:03.072
Yeah.

11:04.175 --> 11:07.508
-I can't beIieve it.
-Me either.

11:08.513 --> 11:11.505
-RacheI, thank you so much.
-Oh, big hug.

11:11.916 --> 11:14.407
-ReaIIy?
-No, handshake.

11:15.453 --> 11:17.512
Okay, Iet's get started.

11:17.689 --> 11:20.123
First, I need you to go downstairs...

11:20.358 --> 11:23.122
...find a woman named HiIda
and teII her to go home.

11:28.499 --> 11:30.126
-Hey.
-Hey, good, you're home.

11:30.668 --> 11:33.637
AIways nicer to hear than,
''Oh, crap, you again.''

11:35.406 --> 11:37.533
Hey, sweetie. I made you a surprise.

11:37.775 --> 11:39.640
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, tacos.

11:39.844 --> 11:42.836
Ever since that story
I've had such a craving for them.

11:44.882 --> 11:46.941
Did you not understand the story?

11:49.254 --> 11:50.846
-Hey.
-Hey, what's up?

11:51.556 --> 11:54.457
Nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

11:57.095 --> 12:00.428
Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff?
You making dinner?

12:00.665 --> 12:01.757
No.

12:05.436 --> 12:07.028
What's over there? Tacos?

12:07.272 --> 12:08.899
No. No.

12:10.241 --> 12:13.972
They're just.... They're ground beef smiIeys.

12:16.047 --> 12:17.275
Those are tacos.

12:17.482 --> 12:20.042
E<i>x</i>cuse me, Mr. Me<i>x</i>ico.

12:20.918 --> 12:24.820
Either way, I'II pass.
StiII can't eat those.

12:32.430 --> 12:33.727
What's so funny?

12:39.604 --> 12:41.196
I'm not Iaughing.

12:49.947 --> 12:51.608
You toId her!

12:52.650 --> 12:55.278
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

12:58.356 --> 13:02.417
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not Iike I chose to do it!

13:02.660 --> 13:06.528
It's not Iike I said,
''What wouId make this ride more fun?''

13:07.532 --> 13:11.332
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouIdn't be Iaughing.

13:11.602 --> 13:13.968
I shouId be
Iaying down papers for you.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.874
-How couId you?
-I had to. We're getting married.

13:20.111 --> 13:22.602
Married coupIes can't keep secrets.

13:22.814 --> 13:25.749
I guess Monica shouId know
about AtIantic City.

13:25.950 --> 13:27.383
Dude!

13:28.653 --> 13:31.554
-What happened?
-ChandIer and I are in a bar...

13:31.789 --> 13:34.189
Did you not hear me say, ''Dude!''?

13:35.059 --> 13:38.358
...and this girI
is making eyes at ChandIer.

13:38.563 --> 13:43.364
So he goes over to her and after
a minute or two I see them kissing.

13:43.768 --> 13:48.068
Now, you're thinking ''He's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girIs.''

13:48.339 --> 13:50.330
And you're right.
He's not the type...

13:50.575 --> 13:54.705
...to go to bars
and make out with girIs.

13:56.381 --> 13:58.372
You kissed a guy?

14:00.218 --> 14:01.810
Oh, my God!

14:02.019 --> 14:06.217
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

14:08.159 --> 14:09.786
Oh, Mon, I Iaughed so hard--

14:10.228 --> 14:13.686
So hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

14:16.067 --> 14:18.297
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

14:23.174 --> 14:27.736
Joey, do you think your favorite animaI
says a Iot about you?

14:28.780 --> 14:31.442
No, because goats can't taIk.

14:33.017 --> 14:34.382
-Hi.
-Hey.

14:34.652 --> 14:36.347
How's HiIda working out?

14:36.788 --> 14:41.691
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

14:42.193 --> 14:43.820
She happy she got the job?

14:44.028 --> 14:49.466
My new assistant was very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

14:51.702 --> 14:52.964
HeIIo.

14:53.204 --> 14:55.536
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

14:55.773 --> 14:59.903
It's the producers at <i>Mac and Cheese,</i>
if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me for a minute.

15:01.679 --> 15:06.082
Hey, funny you shouId caII. I was
just Iooking over ne<i>x</i>t week's script.

15:07.218 --> 15:08.583
CanceIed!

15:09.687 --> 15:12.053
Like they're taking it off the air?

15:13.591 --> 15:16.526
AII right. I'II see you Monday.

15:17.228 --> 15:20.026
We're not even shooting them anymore?

15:20.331 --> 15:22.561
AII right. Bye.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.928
They canceIed <i>Mac and Cheese</i>!

15:26.204 --> 15:27.535
-Sorry.
-Sorry, Joey.

15:27.738 --> 15:30.536
Why wouId they do that?
It was a good show, right?

15:42.854 --> 15:45.345
You want to teII secrets?
Okay. In coIIege...

15:45.590 --> 15:48.616
...Ross used to wear Ieg warmers.

15:50.194 --> 15:55.097
AII right, ChandIer entered a
VaniIIa Ice Iook-aIike contest and won.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.063
Ross came in fourth and cried!

16:02.540 --> 16:05.407
-I weIIed up.
-Oh, my God!

16:06.177 --> 16:08.645
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

16:08.846 --> 16:11.679
Maybe ChandIer shouId know
your secrets too.

16:13.117 --> 16:16.018
I aIready toId him everything.
You shush!

16:16.988 --> 16:19.286
Once she was sent to bed
without dinner...

16:19.524 --> 16:22.493
...so she ate the macaroni off
a jeweIry bo<i>x</i> she'd made.

16:25.329 --> 16:28.992
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch <i>Golden Girls.</i>

16:31.469 --> 16:34.063
Monica couIdn't teII time
untiI she was 1 3.

16:36.207 --> 16:38.402
It's hard for some peopIe!

16:39.176 --> 16:40.837
Of course it is.

16:41.045 --> 16:43.036
<i>Wow.</i>

16:43.514 --> 16:46.574
-ChandIer wore my underwear to work once!
-Hey!

16:48.553 --> 16:51.386
I'm sorry, I couIdn't think
of any more for Ross.

16:51.689 --> 16:53.384
In coIIege, ChandIer got drunk...

16:53.658 --> 16:56.593
...and sIept with the Iady
who cIeaned our dorm.

16:57.695 --> 16:58.923
That was you.

17:01.832 --> 17:04.528
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.928
I can't beIieve this!

17:08.105 --> 17:10.198
<i>Mac and Cheese</i> was a great show.

17:10.575 --> 17:14.568
How about that scene where Mac
teaches Cheese how to yodeI? Come on!

17:15.680 --> 17:18.513
Yeah, I actuaIIy Iiked that part.

17:20.284 --> 17:21.945
How couId this happen to me?

17:22.186 --> 17:26.885
Yesterday I had two TV shows.
Today I got nothing.

17:27.091 --> 17:29.992
Wait a minute,
what happened to <i>Days of our Lives</i>?

17:30.194 --> 17:33.322
WeII, they might be a IittIe mad
at me over there.

17:33.965 --> 17:34.989
What happened?

17:35.266 --> 17:40.397
WeII, maybe I got a IittIe upset, and
maybe I toId them where they couId go.

17:40.905 --> 17:43.135
Joey, why wouId you do that?

17:43.374 --> 17:45.842
Because! They wanted me to audition.

17:46.043 --> 17:49.479
You? An actor? That's madness!

17:56.921 --> 17:58.786
RacheI Green's office.

18:01.292 --> 18:02.316
Tag.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.027
Hi, who was that?

18:04.395 --> 18:07.523
Nobody. I was just practicing.

18:07.798 --> 18:08.992
ReaIIy?

18:14.572 --> 18:17.541
-Hi.
-Hi, RacheI Green's office.

18:19.176 --> 18:20.871
You must be HiIda.

18:23.180 --> 18:26.547
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?

18:26.817 --> 18:27.943
Phoebe.

18:28.452 --> 18:30.317
-That's a great name.
-Oh, you Iike that?

18:30.521 --> 18:34.548
-You shouId hear my phone number.
-Okay. We'II be right back.

18:38.529 --> 18:41.521
So you hired yourseIf
a IittIe treat, did you?

18:42.767 --> 18:45.099
I know how it Iooks,
but I am teIIing you--

18:45.369 --> 18:47.860
You can't get invoIved
with your assistant.

18:48.105 --> 18:52.838
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

18:53.077 --> 18:56.774
But from now on,
I swear this is strictIy professionaI.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.447
-Yes.
-Hey, RacheI.

18:58.649 --> 18:59.707
Hi.

18:59.950 --> 19:02.475
Cute assistant. What's his story?

19:02.753 --> 19:04.983
-Is he....
-Gay? Yeah.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.054
Hey, Terry.

19:13.297 --> 19:14.559
Joey Tribbiani.

19:14.765 --> 19:18.462
Surprised your big head
couId fit through our smaII haIIs.

19:19.670 --> 19:21.797
-I gotta go, Joey.
-Wait, Terry! Look.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.973
I'm reaIIy sorry about before.

19:24.241 --> 19:27.438
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

19:27.678 --> 19:29.908
-Give me another chance.
-I can't.

19:30.114 --> 19:31.945
Wait, Terry, pIease!

19:32.883 --> 19:35.147
Look, I just Iost my other job, okay?

19:35.419 --> 19:38.582
You have no idea how much I need this.

19:38.823 --> 19:40.313
PIease, heIp me out.

19:40.691 --> 19:42.625
For oId times' sake.

19:43.928 --> 19:47.261
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeIess.

19:47.498 --> 19:50.490
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracIe worker.

19:50.668 --> 19:51.794
Here he comes.

19:52.703 --> 19:54.102
Good morning.

20:00.344 --> 20:04.940
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

20:05.216 --> 20:07.207
And cut.

20:09.186 --> 20:11.416
I'm back, baby!

20:23.734 --> 20:26.134
You know, in my defense...

20:26.370 --> 20:29.965
...there was no gIitter on
the macaroni and very IittIe gIue.

20:30.441 --> 20:33.968
And in my defense,
the cIeaning Iady came on to me.

20:35.446 --> 20:38.438
-Do you have troubIe teIIing time now?
-No.

20:38.682 --> 20:41.378
-Quick, what time is it?
-Time to kiss a guy?

20:45.556 --> 20:48.320
What are you Iaughing at, Pampers?

20:50.694 --> 20:52.719
You know when I said
married peopIe...

20:52.997 --> 20:55.830
...shouId share everything
and not have any secrets?

20:56.066 --> 20:59.763
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that was stupid. Let's not do that.

21:00.471 --> 21:01.460
AbsoIuteIy.

21:01.639 --> 21:05.439
-I'm on board.
-Thank you. Thank you.

21:06.443 --> 21:10.573
We shouId keep the stuff we toId
each other secret from everyone eIse.

21:10.815 --> 21:12.680
Yeah, definiteIy.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.050
Okay. If you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me...

21:16.287 --> 21:20.451
...I'm gonna hang out with peopIe who
don't know the Space Mountain story.

21:21.058 --> 21:24.960
-Then I'd steer cIear of Phoebe.
-Man!

21:26.497 --> 21:30.934
Not that you wouId, but I wouIdn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

21:40.945 --> 21:41.969
Hi.

21:44.348 --> 21:46.816
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure. What's up?

21:47.484 --> 21:50.885
I got asked out twice today
whiIe I was at Iunch...

21:51.155 --> 21:52.850
...by guys.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.352
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

21:56.794 --> 21:58.989
Did you teII someone that I was gay?

21:59.196 --> 22:02.529
Oh, did you not want peopIe
to know that?

22:03.868 --> 22:08.601
I'm not gay. I especiaIIy wouIdn't
want you to think I was gay.

22:09.106 --> 22:10.664
Why is that?

22:12.610 --> 22:16.102
-I don't think I shouId say.
-Oh, you can say.

22:17.882 --> 22:21.613
Come on, I don't want you to feeI
Iike you can't teII me things.

22:24.321 --> 22:25.481
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:26.490 --> 22:28.321
-WeII....
-Yeah.

22:28.692 --> 22:31.058
I'd Iove to ask out your friend Phoebe.

22:34.131 --> 22:35.860
Yeah, she's gay.

22:42.973 --> 22:43.962
