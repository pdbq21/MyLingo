WEBVTT

00:04.484 --> 00:07.078
Can I see the comics?

00:07.254 --> 00:09.586
This is the New York Times.

00:09.756 --> 00:12.748
Okay, may I see the comics?

00:13.493 --> 00:16.018
I thought you were taking
Ross to the game.

00:16.263 --> 00:19.528
- We are. He's meeting us here.
- No, Rachel's meeting us here!

00:19.700 --> 00:21.531
Come on!
They can be in the same room.

00:21.702 --> 00:24.694
- You should've been there last night.
- What happened now?

00:24.871 --> 00:26.668
Ross was hanging out at our place.

00:26.840 --> 00:31.004
Rachel comes over to borrow
some moisturizer from Chandler...

00:31.545 --> 00:36.744
How hard is it to say "something"?
Rachel came over to borrow "something."

00:38.018 --> 00:41.476
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

00:41.655 --> 00:42.917
Why was he yelling at her?

00:43.090 --> 00:45.149
He's the one who slept
with someone else.

00:45.325 --> 00:47.657
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

00:47.828 --> 00:49.693
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

00:49.863 --> 00:52.923
He is so unreasonable! God!

00:53.166 --> 00:56.431
Although, I think I understand
what he means.

00:56.603 --> 00:58.730
Oh, my God!
This is like 60 Minutes.

00:58.905 --> 01:00.497
At first, you're really mad...

01:00.674 --> 01:03.234
...at that pharmaceutical company
for making the drug.

01:03.443 --> 01:06.344
And then, you just feel bad
for the people...

01:06.513 --> 01:09.175
...because they needed
to make their hair grow.

01:09.583 --> 01:13.075
You know what this is like?
It's like when my parents got divorced.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.752
Man, I hope Ross doesn't try
to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.

01:18.525 --> 01:22.518
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel were
still together. They never broke up.

01:22.696 --> 01:26.063
- We were all hanging out and happy.
- I had the same dream.

01:26.233 --> 01:31.193
- And nobody slept with the Xerox girl.
- Oh, I had the opposite dream.

01:32.105 --> 01:34.699
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.

01:34.875 --> 01:38.038
It never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

01:38.211 --> 01:42.944
It's never taken you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

01:44.351 --> 01:47.878
Let's go! Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

01:48.054 --> 01:49.112
Let me get coffee.

01:49.289 --> 01:51.985
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's so close.

01:52.159 --> 01:55.959
- Closer than here?
- Oh, look! I found coffee!

01:56.129 --> 01:57.596
Okay, let's skedaddle.

01:57.798 --> 02:00.426
Pheebs, I'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.192
Okay, Your Highness.

02:09.910 --> 02:14.279
"Rachel, I'm really sorry."
"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

02:14.481 --> 02:15.505
"Yeah, okay."

02:15.682 --> 02:18.412
Did anyone else hear that?

02:22.456 --> 02:24.924
The One Without the Ski Trip

03:17.377 --> 03:18.674
- Is he here?
- No.

03:18.845 --> 03:21.109
Here's your moisturizer.

03:24.251 --> 03:27.311
You guys are gonna love me!
Okay, check it out.

03:27.487 --> 03:29.455
Thursday night, five tickets.

03:29.623 --> 03:34.356
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

03:37.097 --> 03:39.691
I said that out loud, right?

03:39.866 --> 03:43.324
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already...

03:43.503 --> 03:46.131
...made plans with Ross.

03:48.408 --> 03:49.841
Well, okay.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.336
Well, there you go.

03:51.611 --> 03:56.139
He got this new home-theater dealie,
and he wants us to check it out.

03:56.316 --> 03:58.011
He's really excited about it too.

03:58.184 --> 04:01.779
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

04:01.955 --> 04:03.889
- We're sorry, honey.
- It's okay.

04:04.057 --> 04:07.584
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

04:08.595 --> 04:11.189
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

04:12.399 --> 04:14.390
And heels.

04:16.970 --> 04:20.098
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

04:20.273 --> 04:23.640
Come on. If he asked you first,
it's only fair.

04:27.447 --> 04:30.211
- Boy, do I feel bad!
- Oh, yeah.

04:30.383 --> 04:31.680
Very bad.

04:31.851 --> 04:34.820
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- Chandler!

04:34.988 --> 04:38.651
- Oh, my God!
- You're smoking again?

04:38.825 --> 04:41.555
Well, actually, yesterday,
I was smoking again.

04:41.728 --> 04:44.288
Today, I'm smoking still.

04:44.464 --> 04:47.865
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

04:48.034 --> 04:50.696
This is just like
my parents' divorce...

04:50.904 --> 04:53.270
...which is when
I first started smoking.

04:54.441 --> 04:56.306
Weren't you 9?

04:58.111 --> 04:59.703
Yeah.

05:01.648 --> 05:06.142
I'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime...

05:07.754 --> 05:09.915
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.557
Him? Ross?

05:11.725 --> 05:15.456
No, Hymn 253:
"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."

05:17.364 --> 05:22.495
When my parents got divorced, I started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

05:24.738 --> 05:27.536
Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?

05:27.707 --> 05:33.771
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

05:33.947 --> 05:37.508
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.

05:37.684 --> 05:38.981
Absolutely.

05:39.152 --> 05:42.053
Chandler! You're smoking?
What are you doing?

05:42.288 --> 05:44.586
Shut up!
You're not my real mom!

05:51.031 --> 05:56.196
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass over here.

05:58.038 --> 06:01.997
Wait, really?
Because mine get me out of tickets.

06:03.410 --> 06:08.575
Look, I just wanna say I really
appreciate you spending time with me.

06:08.748 --> 06:12.844
It's been a pretty hard time right now,
so I just wanna say thanks.

06:13.019 --> 06:17.012
Can somebody else hug him?
I have to stay by the window.

06:18.391 --> 06:23.693
Hey, how about this weekend,
we have a laser-disc marathon, okay?

06:23.863 --> 06:29.495
And maybe a tournament
on my new dartboard?

06:29.669 --> 06:33.127
What do you think?
Two days of darts! It'll be great!

06:34.874 --> 06:38.366
- It'll be great for next weekend.
- No, this weekend, guys.

06:38.545 --> 06:40.706
It'll be great for next weekend.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.781
I mean, "It'll be great."

06:46.653 --> 06:47.711
What's going on?

06:47.887 --> 06:52.984
We're sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

06:56.463 --> 06:59.432
So, for the whole weekend?

06:59.599 --> 07:03.091
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

07:04.938 --> 07:07.338
That's okay.
If you all have to go away...

07:07.507 --> 07:10.067
...for the first weekend
I'm alone by myself...

07:10.243 --> 07:12.734
...then I totally, totally understand.

07:13.513 --> 07:16.971
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.
The last time I went skiing...

07:17.150 --> 07:22.110
...I was afraid to jump off the chair
lift. I just went round and round.

07:22.288 --> 07:25.689
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

07:25.859 --> 07:30.523
- But you know what? I'll stay.
- No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

07:30.697 --> 07:32.688
What, a "pity stay"?

07:33.633 --> 07:35.897
We're gonna have fun!

07:36.069 --> 07:38.230
We can make fudge.

07:40.406 --> 07:41.703
"Pity food"?

07:42.675 --> 07:45.735
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.

07:45.912 --> 07:47.311
Nobody stays.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.176
Well, then, I might as well
offer to stay.

07:57.157 --> 08:02.527
- Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
- You think he's still mad at us?

08:02.695 --> 08:06.927
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.795
What? Mine aren't tinted.

08:12.038 --> 08:14.529
- Chandler!
- What?

08:14.707 --> 08:16.698
What does the sign say?

08:18.244 --> 08:20.474
"Beam me up, Jesus."

08:21.314 --> 08:22.804
The "No smoking" sign.

08:23.049 --> 08:26.246
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

08:26.419 --> 08:29.354
Well, then, I have to go
to the bathroom.

08:29.522 --> 08:31.012
Oh, please!

08:31.224 --> 08:34.990
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

08:35.161 --> 08:39.723
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go!

08:41.568 --> 08:43.160
Oh, now I have to go!

08:45.038 --> 08:47.097
Is that all that it takes?

08:47.273 --> 08:49.366
Sometimes just a small breeze...

08:56.716 --> 08:58.240
Here we go.

08:58.418 --> 09:01.012
- Brace yourself!
- What?

09:09.529 --> 09:11.724
- Aren't you gonna go?
- No, thanks.

09:11.898 --> 09:14.662
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

09:15.235 --> 09:20.502
They never have any paper in there.
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."

09:26.913 --> 09:29.643
Well, if everybody's going...

09:30.416 --> 09:34.648
- Don't close it! The keys are in there!
- Oh, no, no, no!

09:34.821 --> 09:37.449
- What's going on?
- My lighter's in there!

09:44.530 --> 09:47.761
Damn! The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

09:49.269 --> 09:52.136
Relax. I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

09:52.305 --> 09:53.363
Oh, I do.

09:53.539 --> 09:57.100
No, I took it out of my shirt
when I put it on this morning.

09:58.845 --> 10:00.904
So if your parents hadn't divorced...

10:01.080 --> 10:04.948
...you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

10:06.085 --> 10:09.486
Look, I just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

10:09.656 --> 10:11.886
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

10:12.058 --> 10:13.992
What?!

10:14.193 --> 10:17.162
Come on!
Who has the biggest boobs?

10:18.164 --> 10:21.827
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.400
- No!
- It's too expensive!

10:24.570 --> 10:27.539
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

10:27.707 --> 10:29.800
Your call.

10:32.512 --> 10:35.640
Okay. Monica's are the biggest.

10:36.149 --> 10:40.643
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please! Gotta be Rachel.

10:40.820 --> 10:43.846
What? No, mine are deceptively small.

10:44.023 --> 10:48.619
I mean, I actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

10:48.795 --> 10:51.855
Well, then, your bra would
still be big.

10:52.031 --> 10:55.262
No, I stuff outside the bra.

10:55.435 --> 10:57.903
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

10:58.071 --> 11:01.268
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

11:01.441 --> 11:03.602
All right, forget it, never mind.

11:03.776 --> 11:06.267
- You can have mine.
- Thank you.

11:07.714 --> 11:11.980
Chandler, what are you doing?
There is a trash can right there.

11:12.151 --> 11:16.383
I thought if I littered, that crying
Indian might come by and save us.

11:18.491 --> 11:20.755
Okay. There.

11:20.927 --> 11:24.954
Wow. Thank you, Phoebe.
That is very generous.

11:25.765 --> 11:31.829
Wow. This is nice. Were you planning
on meeting somebody up there?

11:32.005 --> 11:35.270
Okay. Now let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

11:37.844 --> 11:40.039
And there you go!

11:44.317 --> 11:45.306
Chandler.

11:45.485 --> 11:48.579
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part!

11:49.989 --> 11:51.456
Okay.

11:57.330 --> 11:59.798
Oh, no.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.967
- What?
- What? What's going on?

12:03.136 --> 12:05.661
Yeah, this has happened before.

12:05.838 --> 12:09.831
- So you know how to fix it?
- Yep. Put more gas in.

12:18.451 --> 12:20.316
Hi. What are you doing here?

12:20.486 --> 12:23.284
I was wondering,
when you and I split up...

12:23.456 --> 12:27.893
...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A.S. H...

12:28.061 --> 12:30.586
...and half the hostages coming home?

12:30.763 --> 12:35.700
Yeah, but now it's Susan and me in
Mexico and the hostages coming home.

12:35.868 --> 12:38.530
- Where's Ben?
- He's sleeping.

12:40.239 --> 12:43.174
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah, actually.

12:43.342 --> 12:47.540
Susan's gonna be here any minute.
It's kind of an anniversary.

12:47.713 --> 12:50.511
I thought you guys
got married in January.

12:50.683 --> 12:53.311
- Different kind of anniversary.
- Oh.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.944
Oh.

12:56.789 --> 12:58.757
So anyway...

12:58.925 --> 13:03.794
Candles, champagne.
Yeah, anniversaries are great...

13:03.963 --> 13:07.228
...because love lasts forever,
you know?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.665
Nothing like it in this lifetime.
Money in the bank.

13:10.837 --> 13:12.668
So Rachel and I broke up.

13:14.107 --> 13:18.066
- God, Ross, I am so sorry.
- Yeah.

13:18.244 --> 13:21.441
You know what?
I wanna talk about this so much...

13:21.614 --> 13:25.345
...when we can really get into it.
You free for dinner tomorrow?

13:25.518 --> 13:27.713
- Yeah. I'd love that.
- Me too.

13:27.887 --> 13:32.153
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

13:33.893 --> 13:36.726
- Okay. Yeah. Triple-A can pick us up.
- Good.

13:36.896 --> 13:39.194
- What town are we near?
- Fremont.

13:39.398 --> 13:44.836
- Westmont. Westberg?
- Okay. Why are you answering?

13:45.271 --> 13:49.674
- Do you know what route we're on?
- We are definitely on Route 27.

13:49.842 --> 13:53.209
Okay. We are at a rest stop
on Route 27.

13:53.379 --> 13:55.574
Okay. There is no Route 27.

13:55.982 --> 13:59.076
- Okay. Either 93 or 76.
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

13:59.252 --> 14:02.221
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.

14:02.388 --> 14:06.916
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

14:07.093 --> 14:10.221
And also 93?

14:10.396 --> 14:14.059
Okay. Yeah. No, they don't do that.

14:16.035 --> 14:18.560
Okay. Somebody will come and save us.

14:18.738 --> 14:23.573
Who? Have you seen a car in the last
hour and a half? We should call Ross.

14:23.743 --> 14:28.578
- He can get a car to pick us up.
- No! I am not getting in a car with Ross!

14:28.748 --> 14:32.081
We will just have to live here.

14:32.418 --> 14:35.751
- But it's cold.
- I'm not getting in a car with him.

14:35.922 --> 14:40.382
- Think of something else.
- Good. Joey and Chandler are back!

14:42.728 --> 14:45.492
- So the "going for help" went well?
- Yeah.

14:45.665 --> 14:49.499
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

14:49.669 --> 14:52.433
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

14:52.605 --> 14:56.564
- Then why are you smoking?
- Well, it's very unsettling.

14:59.078 --> 15:01.842
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

15:02.014 --> 15:05.973
I mean, they just took off,
without even looking back.

15:06.152 --> 15:11.215
You know, I don't need them. I've got
you guys now as friends, you and Susan.

15:11.624 --> 15:14.354
Susan will be so pleased.

15:16.195 --> 15:20.063
Seven-one-seven?
Where's 717?

15:22.235 --> 15:26.035
- You have more for Susan, right?
- No, but that's okay.

15:26.239 --> 15:29.208
I'll just put out pickles
or something.

15:32.979 --> 15:35.004
- Ross, thank God!
- Pheebs?

15:35.181 --> 15:36.705
Why are you whispering?

15:37.149 --> 15:39.583
I ate a bug.

15:40.286 --> 15:44.916
Hey, Rach! The tampons here are only
a penny. Let's stock up.

15:45.758 --> 15:50.354
We ran out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

15:51.364 --> 15:53.229
Now you want a favor?

15:53.399 --> 15:54.388
Yes, please.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.125
I'm sorry your car
broke down, Pheebs...

15:57.303 --> 16:00.500
...but I'm busy with some
real friends right now.

16:00.673 --> 16:03.733
Please call to let me know
you got home safely.

16:03.909 --> 16:07.572
Hang on a second. Take my car.
Go pick up your friends.

16:07.747 --> 16:09.408
No, I won't pick them up.

16:09.582 --> 16:12.949
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.

16:13.119 --> 16:18.318
So you can sulk here, then go pick them
up, or save time and sulk in the car.

16:18.491 --> 16:22.325
- Rachel doesn't...
- I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...

16:22.495 --> 16:27.933
...and you're innocent. But don't punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you.

16:29.468 --> 16:31.129
Yeah, you're right.

16:31.304 --> 16:35.263
Phoebe, hang on. Ross wants
to tell you something. What?

16:35.574 --> 16:37.838
You slept with someone else?

16:38.978 --> 16:41.879
We were on a break! Okay?

16:42.048 --> 16:47.486
We were... We were... Yeah.
Where are you? I'll find you.

16:47.753 --> 16:52.588
- You slept with another woman?
- Oh, you're one to talk.

16:56.529 --> 16:58.394
Okay, done.

17:00.466 --> 17:02.229
What's "pleh"?

17:02.501 --> 17:08.167
That's "help" spelled backwards so that
the helicopters can read it from the air.

17:10.176 --> 17:12.974
What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

17:15.247 --> 17:17.511
Car! Car!

17:19.985 --> 17:22.749
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!

17:22.922 --> 17:24.412
- Hey!
- Hey!

17:24.590 --> 17:28.583
- What is he doing here?
- He is saving your butt.

17:28.761 --> 17:33.323
Unless I'm stepping on some toes,
in which case I could just mosey on.

17:33.499 --> 17:36.866
I've got plenty of people
to help on the interstate.

17:37.036 --> 17:40.301
- We need your help, please!
- Fine! Fine!

17:40.473 --> 17:43.567
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:44.377 --> 17:48.143
Oh, no! Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

17:49.615 --> 17:54.052
You guys, what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

17:54.220 --> 17:57.189
Just send him back,
and we're gonna go skiing?

17:57.356 --> 17:59.756
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.

17:59.925 --> 18:02.894
You think we should
ask Ross to come along?

18:03.062 --> 18:06.259
What about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

18:06.432 --> 18:08.332
Ask me what?

18:10.636 --> 18:13.935
If it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

18:14.106 --> 18:17.007
- No, I wasn't gonna ask that.
- I wasn't.

18:18.611 --> 18:21.774
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come!

18:21.947 --> 18:24.347
- Excuse me?
- It's horrible!

18:24.517 --> 18:29.545
Oh, please? Can't I come
to your special, magical cabin?

18:29.722 --> 18:33.453
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

18:33.626 --> 18:36.993
Hitting me where it hurts!
My ski skills!

18:37.830 --> 18:40.390
- Here we go again.
- I can't handle this.

18:40.566 --> 18:43.091
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

18:43.269 --> 18:46.705
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

18:48.407 --> 18:52.275
- All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.
- All right. Let's go.

18:52.445 --> 18:54.208
- You're welcome.
- I'm sorry.

18:54.380 --> 18:57.975
Were you speaking to me,
or sleeping with someone else?

18:58.651 --> 19:00.050
We were on a break!

19:00.219 --> 19:03.814
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

19:03.989 --> 19:08.824
It's valid, and I'm not the only one
who thinks so. Monica agrees with me.

19:08.994 --> 19:12.862
- What?
- I don't know.

19:13.632 --> 19:18.592
- You said it last night.
- What I said was that I understood.

19:18.771 --> 19:22.138
- Joey is the one who agreed with you.
- Okay.

19:22.308 --> 19:24.333
Really, Joey?

19:25.177 --> 19:26.667
What?

19:27.313 --> 19:30.407
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

19:30.616 --> 19:35.781
- I think it's obvious who's wrong here.
- Obviously not to Joey.

19:37.990 --> 19:39.548
What?

19:39.959 --> 19:44.953
- Joey and Monica feel the way I do!
- You and this "innocent puppy" act!

19:45.130 --> 19:47.257
Guess who I am?

19:50.169 --> 19:53.297
All right. You know what?
I can't even...

19:53.472 --> 19:57.408
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:57.576 --> 19:59.976
Look what you're doing to Chandler!

20:03.249 --> 20:07.379
Look. We know that this is really,
really hard for you guys.

20:07.553 --> 20:10.613
You know... You don't have
to love each other.

20:10.789 --> 20:14.281
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

20:14.460 --> 20:17.691
But please, find a way
to be around each other.

20:17.863 --> 20:20.093
And not put us in the middle.

20:20.266 --> 20:24.794
Yeah. I mean, otherwise, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

20:24.970 --> 20:27.461
You know? Is that what you want?

20:29.241 --> 20:31.334
Can you be civil?

20:32.878 --> 20:36.041
- Yeah.
- I can.

20:36.715 --> 20:41.675
Good. Let's get back in the car. It's
freezing, and my chest is unsupported.

20:42.688 --> 20:47.455
Wait a second! I mean, what are
we doing? Who's going with who?

20:50.796 --> 20:53.629
Look, you guys should go.

20:53.799 --> 20:57.895
No. You know,
you planned this all out, and...

20:58.771 --> 21:02.002
...I don't wanna ruin it.
So you should just go.

21:02.174 --> 21:06.736
- You drove all the way up here.
- I've got to take the car back anyway.

21:06.912 --> 21:10.541
I'm spending all day tomorrow
with Ben. It's fine, okay?

21:10.716 --> 21:13.412
Just go. No guilt. I promise.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.547
Thank you.

21:18.691 --> 21:20.818
We'll call you when we get back.

21:20.993 --> 21:24.019
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

21:24.196 --> 21:26.391
Or the rodeo!

21:27.232 --> 21:29.723
- That would be great.
- Okay.

21:30.836 --> 21:34.465
I was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.903
I know.

21:45.718 --> 21:47.481
Bye!

22:10.776 --> 22:13.540
- Ross.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

22:13.712 --> 22:15.942
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

22:16.115 --> 22:18.549
Oh, great, because...

22:19.184 --> 22:22.779
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

22:22.955 --> 22:25.788
- That's not where you wanna skimp.
- You're a genius.

22:25.958 --> 22:30.361
It came to about $112. But what
the hell? Just call it an even 110?

22:30.529 --> 22:33.054
Okay. I'll pay you
tomorrow, Ross. Bye!

22:33.232 --> 22:39.000
So they all took off. It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

22:39.171 --> 22:40.433
Yeah, okay. Bye.

22:44.610 --> 22:47.204
So I'm gonna take off, then.

22:47.780 --> 22:48.769
