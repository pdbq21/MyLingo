WEBVTT

00:02.282 --> 00:04.978
Okay, pick a card. Any card.

00:05.152 --> 00:07.620
All right, now memorize it.

00:07.788 --> 00:10.086
Show it to everybody.

00:10.257 --> 00:11.246
Got it?

00:11.425 --> 00:13.825
All right. Give it back to me.

00:18.699 --> 00:20.132
Five of hearts.

00:21.134 --> 00:23.659
Real magic does exist.

00:23.837 --> 00:27.068
- Joey, how do you do it?
- I can't tell you that.

00:30.777 --> 00:33.769
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

00:34.114 --> 00:36.776
That's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.612
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

00:39.786 --> 00:43.347
Why don't you go ask him to just,
"Step lightly, please?"

00:44.224 --> 00:47.387
I have, like, five times.
But the guy is so charming...

00:47.561 --> 00:51.053
...I go up there to yell,
then I end up apologizing to him.

00:51.231 --> 00:53.461
That is silly!

00:53.633 --> 00:55.931
I'll go up there.
I'll tell him to keep it down.

00:56.103 --> 00:58.003
- All right, be my guest.
- Good luck.

00:58.171 --> 00:59.331
All right, all right...

00:59.506 --> 01:02.532
...if you wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

01:02.776 --> 01:05.836
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

01:06.012 --> 01:10.346
...I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

01:11.485 --> 01:13.453
I just did it.

01:14.020 --> 01:16.147
Just did it again.

01:16.923 --> 01:20.154
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

01:21.695 --> 01:24.129
- I got it now!
- Okay.

01:42.048 --> 01:44.141
Thank you.

01:47.888 --> 01:50.254
The One Where Chandler
Can't Remember Which Sister

02:32.833 --> 02:36.997
Hi. Anybody got a length of rope
about six feet long...

02:37.170 --> 02:39.104
...little noose at the end?

02:39.272 --> 02:42.435
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I just saw Janice.

02:42.609 --> 02:47.945
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating
with her husband. She looked so happy.

02:48.114 --> 02:51.880
I almost feel bad for whipping
that kid's pretzel at them.

02:52.853 --> 02:56.016
I remember the first time I saw
Katherine after we broke up.

02:56.189 --> 02:59.420
She was with her friend Donna.
Just laughing and talking.

02:59.593 --> 03:01.493
God, it killed me!

03:01.661 --> 03:05.859
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

03:06.766 --> 03:11.169
Sorry, I just... Any excuse
to tell that story, you know?

03:11.671 --> 03:14.970
Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

03:15.141 --> 03:18.736
I'm gonna be okay. You don't
have to throw a party for me.

03:18.912 --> 03:21.380
It's Joey's birthday.

03:21.681 --> 03:25.208
Then if anybody should have a party,
it should be him.

03:28.021 --> 03:31.388
I cannot believe
she's still up there.

03:39.799 --> 03:42.632
Well, he totally screwed up
the punch line.

03:42.802 --> 03:45.100
You know, it's supposed to be...

03:52.078 --> 03:55.912
- How's that coffee coming, dear?
- Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

03:56.082 --> 03:59.916
I'm not suppose to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.

04:00.287 --> 04:02.312
I know.

04:03.056 --> 04:06.025
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl...

04:06.192 --> 04:10.185
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

04:10.363 --> 04:12.228
You got me.

04:12.399 --> 04:14.867
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

04:15.035 --> 04:19.199
I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

04:19.372 --> 04:21.738
- How does that sound?
- That sounds great!

04:21.975 --> 04:25.308
- Come on over here, sweetheart.
- Thank you so much.

04:25.478 --> 04:29.676
I need these hangers separated
ASAP.

04:31.484 --> 04:33.349
You're welcome.

04:37.157 --> 04:41.355
- Oh, God, I hate my job! I hate it.
- I know, honey. I'm sorry.

04:41.528 --> 04:45.020
I wanna quit, but then
I think I should stick it out.

04:45.198 --> 04:46.324
Then I think:

04:46.499 --> 04:49.764
"Why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

04:49.936 --> 04:54.964
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?"

04:56.042 --> 04:57.771
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

04:57.944 --> 05:02.438
Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

05:02.616 --> 05:06.518
Come on, I'm sorry. I didn't...
I don't mind paying my dues, you know?

05:06.686 --> 05:08.950
But how much will I learn
about fashion...

05:09.122 --> 05:14.082
...by walking Myra, the arthritic
seamstress, to the bathroom?

05:15.528 --> 05:18.554
Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?

05:18.932 --> 05:21.560
I'm sorry, I was just...

05:21.735 --> 05:23.862
It's not funny.
This is actually my job.

05:24.037 --> 05:25.732
No, believe me, I've been there.

05:25.905 --> 05:29.898
I had to sort mannequin heads
at that Mannequins Plus.

05:30.076 --> 05:33.637
Well, then. I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

05:33.813 --> 05:36.338
You can go back to enjoying
your little hamburger.

05:36.516 --> 05:39.713
Actually, that's
a Barbra Streisand-wich.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.315
What? I named that one.

05:43.857 --> 05:47.224
- Just one other thing.
- Yes?

05:47.394 --> 05:49.157
I work at Bloomingdale's.

05:49.329 --> 05:53.459
I might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

05:55.402 --> 05:57.632
Do you want my pickle?

06:03.843 --> 06:06.209
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Gunther.

06:06.379 --> 06:09.007
You're going on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

06:09.182 --> 06:12.811
- Well, he's very charming.
- I know. He's too charming!

06:13.019 --> 06:16.318
But if you go out,
it'll be harder for me to hate him.

06:16.489 --> 06:19.549
Well, you're just going
to have to try.

06:20.493 --> 06:22.518
Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

06:22.696 --> 06:24.994
I don't know.
Chandler's passing them...

06:26.599 --> 06:27.896
Chandler!

06:28.068 --> 06:30.036
Hello-dee-lo!

06:30.570 --> 06:33.232
Well, somebody's feeling better.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.367
- Stick out your tongue!
- Take off your shirt!

06:39.913 --> 06:41.813
- Oh, my...!
- Oh, my God!

06:41.981 --> 06:44.609
How many did you have?
These are pure vodka.

06:44.784 --> 06:47.685
Yeah, Jell-O.
Just like Mom used to make.

06:49.522 --> 06:52.491
The most unbelievable thing
happened today.

06:52.659 --> 06:56.186
I'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me.

06:56.396 --> 06:58.694
He works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's.

06:58.865 --> 07:02.426
There's an opening there!
So I gave him my phone number.

07:02.702 --> 07:05.899
He's gonna call me this weekend
to get me an interview!

07:06.072 --> 07:07.767
I know!

07:07.941 --> 07:11.809
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

07:12.979 --> 07:18.713
- And he's a total stranger?
- Yeah. His name is Mark something.

07:18.952 --> 07:22.888
Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex!

07:23.590 --> 07:25.285
What?

07:25.458 --> 07:30.122
I'm just saying. Why else would he
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

07:30.296 --> 07:31.422
To be nice.

07:31.598 --> 07:35.625
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

07:35.802 --> 07:38.270
- No, only for sex.
- Thank you.

07:39.906 --> 07:43.467
So did you tell
Mark Something about me?

07:44.310 --> 07:45.299
I didn't have to.

07:45.478 --> 07:50.472
I was wearing my "I Heart Ross"
sandwich board and ringing my bell.

07:52.085 --> 07:55.111
Joey!
Happy birthday!

07:59.025 --> 08:02.153
How many of that girl are you seeing?

08:04.397 --> 08:07.662
How hammered are you?
These are Joey's sisters.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.825
Hi, Joey's sisters!

08:10.003 --> 08:12.597
What are we drinking over here?

08:12.939 --> 08:15.965
Well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

08:16.142 --> 08:17.234
No kidding?

08:17.410 --> 08:22.370
That's the same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

08:24.450 --> 08:26.941
Okay, I don't know how
to talk to you.

08:28.655 --> 08:30.020
What you doing?

08:30.623 --> 08:34.559
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

08:34.727 --> 08:36.752
No, it's a good thing.

08:36.930 --> 08:40.388
Why must we dial so speedily, anyway?
Why rush through life?

08:40.567 --> 08:42.762
Why can't we savor
the precious moments?

08:42.936 --> 08:45.905
Those are some huge breasts you have!

08:46.973 --> 08:49.237
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:49.409 --> 08:53.573
So I heard about this Mark guy
that Rachel met today.

08:53.746 --> 08:56.340
- Isn't it great?
- Oh, yeah!

08:56.516 --> 08:59.815
So yeah, pretty good...
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

08:59.986 --> 09:02.887
Oh, he is.
And he is so dreamy!

09:03.056 --> 09:05.957
I mean, when he left,
I actually used the phrase:

09:06.125 --> 09:08.059
"Hummina, hummina, hummina."

09:10.063 --> 09:12.088
That's excellent.

09:15.501 --> 09:17.969
So he's "just a nice guy."

09:18.404 --> 09:22.397
Do you really think this Mark
doesn't want anything for helping you?

09:22.575 --> 09:25.703
Well, I assume I'll have
to take showers with him.

09:25.879 --> 09:28.575
But, you know, that's true of any job.

09:32.619 --> 09:33.847
How you feeling?

09:34.020 --> 09:38.650
Well, my apartment isn't
there anymore because I drank it.

09:40.426 --> 09:44.192
Where'd you go? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

09:44.697 --> 09:48.690
I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

09:51.204 --> 09:54.002
No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

09:55.108 --> 09:57.235
Why, what happened?

09:59.212 --> 10:02.113
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

10:02.548 --> 10:05.984
- That's not the worst part.
- What is the worst part?

10:06.152 --> 10:08.211
I can't remember which sister.

10:09.489 --> 10:12.185
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

10:12.358 --> 10:13.985
This is men!

10:15.528 --> 10:16.825
Are you insane?

10:16.996 --> 10:19.829
Joey will kill you.
He'll actually kill you dead.

10:19.999 --> 10:22.866
You don't think I thought of that?

10:23.036 --> 10:26.335
- How can you not know which one?
- That's unbelievable.

10:26.506 --> 10:28.167
- Was it Gina?
- Which one's Gina?

10:28.341 --> 10:30.571
The dark, big hair,
with airplane earrings.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.505
No, that's not Gina. That's Dina.

10:32.679 --> 10:35.978
You see? You can't tell
which is which either!

10:37.717 --> 10:40.686
We didn't fool around
with any of them.

10:43.990 --> 10:47.187
It's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.454
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat!

10:50.930 --> 10:52.864
That was me.

10:55.568 --> 10:59.698
When I drink, sometimes
I get overly friendly and I'm sorry.

10:59.872 --> 11:01.271
- That's okay.
- That's all right.

11:01.441 --> 11:03.170
That's okay.

11:06.779 --> 11:08.906
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:10.350 --> 11:12.545
Hey, Joey!

11:14.320 --> 11:15.753
Come on.

11:16.422 --> 11:18.356
Why can't we talk in here...

11:18.524 --> 11:20.458
...with witnesses?

11:20.660 --> 11:22.958
I just got off the phone
with my sister.

11:23.129 --> 11:24.756
- Which one?
- Mary Angela.

11:24.931 --> 11:26.421
- Mary Angela.
- Yeah.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.824
Now which one is she again?

11:29.002 --> 11:32.096
Why don't you ask Chandler?
He fooled around with her.

11:32.271 --> 11:35.365
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

11:35.541 --> 11:40.274
Is that true, or are you just getting
over Janice by groping my sister?

11:42.482 --> 11:44.712
It's gotta be the first one.

11:45.518 --> 11:46.780
Really?

11:46.953 --> 11:49.114
That's great!

11:49.555 --> 11:52.854
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

11:53.826 --> 11:55.987
Yep, I'm in a tree.

11:58.798 --> 12:00.459
Did he call? Did Mark call?

12:00.733 --> 12:04.396
No, honey, I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

12:06.539 --> 12:09.406
Oh, my God! Is that Phoebe?

12:09.575 --> 12:11.805
Guess they're back from their date.

12:13.546 --> 12:15.878
Music!

12:16.049 --> 12:18.074
Very nice!

12:26.025 --> 12:27.185
Oh, my God!

12:30.229 --> 12:34.563
- So how are you?
- I am good. I finished my book.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.929
- What's it about?
- I don't remember.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.936
- Do you wanna take a walk?
- Yeah, I do.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.403
"Dear Mary Angela:

12:44.577 --> 12:46.204
Hi, how's it going?

12:46.379 --> 12:48.847
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write."

12:49.015 --> 12:51.540
What the hell's the matter with you?

12:51.717 --> 12:55.380
How will Joey react to you
blowing off his sister with a letter?

12:55.555 --> 12:58.922
That's the part where you tell him
that I moved to France...

12:59.225 --> 13:01.785
...when actually I'll be in Cuba.

13:01.961 --> 13:06.796
Look, you've got to do this yourself.
In person. At least you know her name.

13:06.966 --> 13:09.594
You just go to the house
and ask for Mary Angela.

13:09.769 --> 13:11.896
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

13:12.071 --> 13:15.302
...you take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

13:15.475 --> 13:19.536
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and I ask for Mary Angela?

13:19.779 --> 13:22.111
Where in Cuba?

13:33.092 --> 13:36.425
Joey! What are you doing here?

13:36.596 --> 13:38.962
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

13:39.132 --> 13:43.091
- What about you?
- I'm here to see Mary Angela.

13:43.803 --> 13:46.966
You are so the man! Come on.

13:47.773 --> 13:50.207
Now look, listen.
Listen...

13:50.376 --> 13:53.470
Be cool, because Grandma
doesn't know about you two.

13:53.646 --> 13:55.637
And you do not wanna tick her off.

13:55.815 --> 13:59.979
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

14:01.254 --> 14:05.247
- Where are your parents?
- They're in Vermont, buying cigarettes.

14:05.424 --> 14:07.358
Where's Mary Angela?

14:07.527 --> 14:09.961
- She's right in there.
- Okay.

14:11.430 --> 14:14.126
- Hey, Chandler!
- Hey, Chandler!

14:17.737 --> 14:19.967
I can't believe Mark didn't call.

14:20.206 --> 14:23.903
- It's Sunday night and he didn't call.
- Bummer.

14:24.310 --> 14:27.575
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

14:27.747 --> 14:30.477
I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

14:30.650 --> 14:34.746
Look, Rach, I want
only good things for you.

14:34.921 --> 14:38.550
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

14:39.859 --> 14:42.123
Who says you have to sit
and wait for him?

14:42.295 --> 14:44.024
You've got to make stuff happen!

14:44.197 --> 14:47.792
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

14:47.967 --> 14:50.834
It's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

14:51.003 --> 14:54.063
He gave you his home number,
as in, to his home?

14:54.340 --> 14:58.242
And you don't mind if I call,
because you want good things for me.

14:58.411 --> 15:02.507
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

15:05.418 --> 15:09.354
Hello. Mark?
Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

15:11.958 --> 15:15.394
Oh, no.
Don't you apologize.

15:15.561 --> 15:16.721
Yeah, I'll hold.

15:17.263 --> 15:19.527
He left my number at work
and was gonna get it...

15:19.699 --> 15:23.294
...but he had to help his niece
with her report on the pioneers.

15:23.469 --> 15:26.029
That is so made up!

15:26.772 --> 15:28.433
Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

15:28.608 --> 15:30.371
That's... No, it's perfect.

15:30.543 --> 15:32.807
Oh, God! Thank you so much!

15:32.979 --> 15:34.446
Great. Bye.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.940
- I got the interview!
- There you go!

15:38.117 --> 15:41.245
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

15:41.420 --> 15:42.478
That is amazing!

15:42.655 --> 15:46.716
Well, if I know Mark,
and I think I do...

15:47.426 --> 15:49.018
...l'd expect nothing less.

15:49.195 --> 15:50.753
I gotta figure out what to wear.

15:50.930 --> 15:54.798
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro!"

15:55.134 --> 15:58.661
Yeah, right.
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

15:58.838 --> 16:00.999
You go get them!

16:01.173 --> 16:04.267
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

16:05.211 --> 16:08.442
- What?
- "Why don't you call him?"

16:08.614 --> 16:12.072
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her...

16:12.251 --> 16:16.278
...as in what you do before
you surgically remove the boyfriend!

16:16.689 --> 16:17.678
Are you crazy?

16:17.857 --> 16:22.453
Am I? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

16:23.129 --> 16:26.587
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend
out for a meal!

16:26.832 --> 16:28.595
This isn't even about you!

16:28.768 --> 16:31.430
It's about something wonderful
happening for Rachel.

16:31.871 --> 16:34.669
Even if you're right,
and he wants to sleep with her...

16:34.874 --> 16:36.808
...does that mean he gets to?

16:36.976 --> 16:38.944
- No, but...
- Don't you trust her?

16:40.446 --> 16:43.040
Then get over yourself!
Grow up!

16:47.286 --> 16:49.345
You grow up.

17:00.499 --> 17:05.664
This tiramisu is excellent.
Did you make it, Mary Angela?

17:05.838 --> 17:07.237
No, I did.

17:08.474 --> 17:10.135
Well, it's yummy.

17:11.243 --> 17:14.940
So... Mary Angela, do you like it?

17:15.114 --> 17:17.412
Of course. It's her favorite.

17:19.852 --> 17:24.448
So... Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

17:24.623 --> 17:26.181
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.294
Oh, would you just please...

17:30.663 --> 17:34.599
...give me your recipe,
because this is great! It's topnotch!

17:34.767 --> 17:35.961
That dies with me.

17:36.135 --> 17:38.000
So will I.

17:39.605 --> 17:41.937
Excuse yourself
and go to the bathroom.

17:42.108 --> 17:44.542
I was just squinting.
It doesn't mean anything.

17:44.710 --> 17:46.268
Just do it!

17:51.884 --> 17:54.546
Will you excuse me, I have to...

18:07.466 --> 18:11.232
Finally! I thought we'd never be alone.
Can I just tell you something?

18:11.404 --> 18:15.170
I have not stopped thinking
about you since the party.

18:16.275 --> 18:20.075
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.

18:22.047 --> 18:23.878
I just got out of a relationship...

18:24.049 --> 18:27.951
...and I'm not really
in a in a commitment kind of place.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.212
So? Me neither!

18:29.388 --> 18:34.018
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.150
You're not Mary Angela?

18:36.328 --> 18:38.455
No! I'm Mary Therese!

18:38.998 --> 18:40.932
This is so bad.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.898
If you're not Mary Angela,
then who is?

18:44.069 --> 18:45.866
I am.

18:46.839 --> 18:48.932
Oh, it's so bad.

18:49.241 --> 18:52.972
- Joey!
- No Joey! No Joey! No Joey!

18:53.145 --> 18:55.511
- Joey.
- What's going on?

18:56.315 --> 18:58.408
You're it! Now run and hide!

18:59.552 --> 19:02.146
It's no big deal.
Chandler was just kissing me...

19:02.321 --> 19:04.551
...because he thought
I was Mary Angela.

19:04.723 --> 19:07.692
What? How could you think
she was Mary Angela?

19:07.860 --> 19:10.920
I wasn't sure which one
Mary Angela was.

19:12.698 --> 19:17.032
Look, I'm sorry. I was really drunk
and you guys all look really similar.

19:17.203 --> 19:20.001
- I say punch him, Joey!
- Yeah, punch him!

19:20.172 --> 19:22.140
We should all calm down...

19:22.308 --> 19:24.868
...because your brother's
not gonna punch me.

19:25.044 --> 19:28.536
- Are you?
- That is usually what I would do.

19:28.714 --> 19:31.581
But I never thought you'd be
on the receiving end of it.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.081
How could you do this?

19:33.252 --> 19:35.220
Hey, where'd everybody go?

19:35.387 --> 19:38.220
Why don't you go into the den?
I think Cops is on.

19:43.195 --> 19:46.062
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

19:46.232 --> 19:50.635
But I want you to know that I'd never
soberly hurt you or your family.

19:50.803 --> 19:52.703
You're my best friend.

19:52.872 --> 19:56.933
And I would never do anything
like this, ever again.

19:57.409 --> 20:00.071
So what? I say punch him!

20:00.246 --> 20:01.679
Yeah, punch him!

20:02.681 --> 20:05.479
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

20:05.951 --> 20:07.976
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't!

20:08.354 --> 20:12.313
He knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him. He's sorry.

20:12.491 --> 20:16.894
But you got one more apology to make.
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

20:17.062 --> 20:20.395
- Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
- All right.

20:29.642 --> 20:31.633
- Cookie, now you can punch him!
- What?

20:40.085 --> 20:42.053
Hey! What are you doing here?

20:42.288 --> 20:45.348
You know, this building's
on my paper route, so...

20:47.293 --> 20:48.726
How did it go?

20:48.894 --> 20:51.556
The woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough...

20:51.730 --> 20:53.493
...but thank God Mark coached me.

20:53.666 --> 20:56.601
Once I talked about the Fall line,
she got all happy.

20:56.769 --> 20:59.795
- I'm so proud of you.
- Me too!

21:00.406 --> 21:01.703
Listen, I'm...

21:02.841 --> 21:07.301
I'm sorry I've been so crazy
and jealous and...

21:07.479 --> 21:09.743
It's just, I like you a lot, so...

21:09.915 --> 21:12.042
- I know.
- Yeah?

21:12.217 --> 21:14.242
- Rachel. Hi.
- Hi, Mark.

21:14.820 --> 21:18.984
I just talked to Joanna,
and she loves you. You got the job.

21:19.158 --> 21:21.058
- I did?
- Yes!

21:21.226 --> 21:22.352
Oh, my God!

21:22.628 --> 21:25.096
Congratulations...

21:29.802 --> 21:32.430
So, Phoebe, how was your date?

21:32.605 --> 21:34.630
Oh, well, you know...

21:34.807 --> 21:37.298
Yeah, I do know.

21:37.476 --> 21:38.875
You were eavesdropping?

21:39.044 --> 21:42.980
Eavesdropping? Pheebs,
the ceiling tiles were falling down.

21:44.783 --> 21:46.182
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:46.352 --> 21:48.183
But I really like this guy...

21:48.354 --> 21:51.653
...and I think he really
happens to likes me.

21:56.929 --> 21:58.157
Maybe he's just...

21:58.330 --> 22:01.493
...jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

22:05.170 --> 22:07.263
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

22:09.074 --> 22:11.975
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe!

22:12.144 --> 22:15.375
This guy's gonna get
the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

22:15.547 --> 22:17.742
But is he a big guy?

22:17.916 --> 22:19.213
We'll all go. Come on.

22:19.385 --> 22:22.650
Well, let's see,
I just got beat up by a girl...

22:22.821 --> 22:24.516
They need me.

22:25.257 --> 22:28.055
- Thanks, you guys. Thank you!
- Don't worry!

22:28.227 --> 22:31.754
God!
I hope they kick his ass!

22:31.930 --> 22:33.363
Honey, I'm sorry.

22:33.532 --> 22:35.056
If it's any consolation...

22:35.234 --> 22:39.000
...he really did sound like
he was having more fun with you.

22:57.189 --> 22:58.178
