WEBVTT

00:07.737 --> 00:08.795
Hold on a second.

00:13.076 --> 00:13.906
Nice.

00:15.378 --> 00:16.675
I got you something.

00:16.913 --> 00:17.811
What's this?

00:18.014 --> 00:19.743
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

00:20.249 --> 00:22.843
Didn't Big Leon tell you?
It's a thousand...

00:23.052 --> 00:24.986
...to have me for the whole night.

00:25.855 --> 00:26.685
What's this for?

00:26.889 --> 00:29.050
Well, I'm making money now.

00:29.258 --> 00:34.161
I'm paying you back for headshots,
electric bills, all that pizza....

00:34.363 --> 00:35.227
I love you, man.

00:35.431 --> 00:38.662
Well, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.

00:39.936 --> 00:42.530
This is a little extra something for...

00:42.739 --> 00:44.502
...always being there for me.

00:45.374 --> 00:47.171
Wow, I don't know what to say.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.448
Wow, I don't know what to say.

00:56.919 --> 00:57.886
What do you say?

00:58.087 --> 00:59.384
I don't know.

01:01.290 --> 01:02.348
It's a bracelet.

01:02.558 --> 01:05.618
Isn't it? It's engraved, too.
Check it out.

01:06.095 --> 01:07.790
"To my best bud."

01:13.035 --> 01:14.127
Thanks, best bud.

01:15.304 --> 01:16.271
Put it on.

01:16.539 --> 01:17.528
Now?

01:20.243 --> 01:23.007
No, it should be saved
for a special occasion.

01:23.212 --> 01:26.147
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

01:26.883 --> 01:29.374
When you put this on,
you're good to go.

01:31.374 --> 01:36.374
I'm never being good to go, so why don't try some jewrel.

01:38.923 --> 01:40.390
Oh, man!

01:40.825 --> 01:43.487
You are so wearing that bracelet!

01:44.396 --> 01:46.057
I so am!

01:46.931 --> 01:49.798
Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

01:50.001 --> 01:51.764
It might slow down at first, but...

01:51.970 --> 01:55.167
...once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

01:56.174 --> 01:58.165
The One With the Prom Video

02:43.089 --> 02:45.080
-This all looks good.
-Great.

02:45.358 --> 02:48.486
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job...?

02:48.694 --> 02:51.857
That's right there, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

02:52.264 --> 02:53.424
All right.

02:53.632 --> 02:57.659
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

02:58.003 --> 03:01.166
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

03:01.374 --> 03:04.172
No, just the salad will be fine.

03:05.010 --> 03:05.942
You got it.

03:06.145 --> 03:10.946
Now I want you to tell me what
you're doing while you're doing it.

03:11.684 --> 03:15.484
All right. Well,
I'm tearing the lettuce.

03:15.888 --> 03:16.718
Is it dirty?

03:16.956 --> 03:18.389
Oh, I'm gonna wash it.

03:18.624 --> 03:20.854
Don't. I like it dirty.

03:23.562 --> 03:25.052
That's your call.

03:25.364 --> 03:28.390
So, what are you going to do next?

03:28.701 --> 03:31.135
I thought that l'd
cut up the tomatoes.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.668
Are they firm?

03:35.975 --> 03:36.839
They're all right.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.976
You sure they haven't gone bad?

03:39.211 --> 03:41.839
You sure they're not very, very bad?

03:45.718 --> 03:47.151
No, really, they're okay.

03:47.486 --> 03:49.647
You gonna slice them up real nice?

03:49.889 --> 03:51.754
I was going to do them julienne.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.922
I'm out of here!

04:04.503 --> 04:05.527
Hello?

04:06.505 --> 04:09.030
Rachel's not here.
Can I take a message?

04:10.341 --> 04:11.774
How do we spell Casey?

04:12.010 --> 04:15.104
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

04:19.184 --> 04:20.742
Hey, who's this Casey?

04:20.986 --> 04:22.578
Some guy she met at the movies.

04:22.821 --> 04:24.584
What does he want with her?

04:24.823 --> 04:26.916
I guess he wants to
do a little dance...

04:28.994 --> 04:31.224
...you know, make a little love....

04:34.166 --> 04:35.656
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.371
I don't know. I don't

04:43.609 --> 04:47.204
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.848
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

04:51.049 --> 04:55.008
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

04:55.854 --> 04:58.220
Or Rachel and I should be together...

04:58.423 --> 05:01.449
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.062
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.730
Now, how do you know that?

05:06.431 --> 05:08.729
Because she's your lobster.

05:11.036 --> 05:12.526
Oh, she's going somewhere.

05:14.773 --> 05:19.142
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

05:19.378 --> 05:23.474
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

05:23.749 --> 05:27.446
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like....

05:36.090 --> 05:37.648
Hey, you feeling better?

05:37.892 --> 05:41.225
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
got the interview off me.

05:41.996 --> 05:43.964
Do you have other possibilities?

05:44.165 --> 05:47.430
There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

05:47.435 --> 05:49.403
If you want,
I can lend you money.

05:49.537 --> 05:54.474
If I couldn't pay you back right away,
I'd feel guilty and tense around you.

05:55.377 --> 05:57.777
Then why not borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

05:57.979 --> 06:00.812
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

06:01.082 --> 06:03.573
Might as well
make some money off of them.

06:04.219 --> 06:05.948
The man's got a point.

06:07.389 --> 06:09.323
What is that sparkly thing?

06:10.125 --> 06:11.558
That thing?

06:14.295 --> 06:16.422
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

06:17.565 --> 06:18.463
No, no.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.395
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

06:25.240 --> 06:29.404
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

06:40.716 --> 06:41.683
Hi, darling.

06:41.918 --> 06:42.885
What's this?

06:43.086 --> 06:44.519
Some of your old stuff.

06:44.754 --> 06:48.155
Well, sweetie,
we have a surprise for you.

06:48.357 --> 06:50.382
We're turning your room into a gym.

06:52.428 --> 06:54.555
Wow, that is a surprise!

06:54.764 --> 06:57.232
Just one question.
Why not Ross's room?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.865
We talked about that...

06:59.068 --> 07:03.767
... but your brother had so many
science trophies, plaques, merit badges....

07:04.006 --> 07:05.871
We didn't want to disturb them.

07:06.075 --> 07:07.508
God forbid!

07:08.508 --> 07:11.908
What's with you. What can you tell us.
How is your job.

07:12.308 --> 07:13.908
My job, well!

07:15.208 --> 07:17.508
Do I mention that I still don't have a boyfriend.

07:19.008 --> 07:20.508
I just assume

07:27.950 --> 07:31.283
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

07:31.487 --> 07:35.287
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

07:35.491 --> 07:37.652
I can't say any of us
were surprised.

07:39.728 --> 07:42.993
They've been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

07:43.232 --> 07:45.723
Especially after
that incident in Hawaii.

07:47.403 --> 07:49.667
What? What incident?

07:49.905 --> 07:53.102
No, no. I must be
thinking of someone else.

07:53.342 --> 07:54.934
Maybe me!

07:55.144 --> 07:57.339
Don't you have some folding to do?

07:57.580 --> 07:59.104
Fold. You fold.

08:02.952 --> 08:05.785
-Want a refill?
-I'm all right, thanks.

08:08.490 --> 08:11.425
Give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

08:16.031 --> 08:19.364
Dude, eleven o'clock,
totally hot babe checking you out.

08:22.037 --> 08:26.030
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

08:34.183 --> 08:37.880
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

08:38.988 --> 08:39.852
I'm Gail.

08:43.792 --> 08:46.556
I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

08:55.204 --> 08:56.034
Excellent!

08:56.238 --> 08:59.401
He could have gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

08:59.642 --> 09:02.076
But no! He got me
the "woman repeller"!

09:03.078 --> 09:06.241
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

09:06.482 --> 09:08.541
-It's not bad.
-Easy for you to say.

09:08.817 --> 09:11.877
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. Tcollection!

09:13.522 --> 09:17.049
"l pity the fool that
puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!"

09:17.259 --> 09:18.226
"l pity that fool"

09:20.996 --> 09:24.227
Hey, man! We were just
doing some impressions.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.900
Do your Marcel Marceau.

09:28.370 --> 09:29.667
That's actually good.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.241
Would you look at that guy?

09:40.449 --> 09:42.383
How long has he
been talking to her?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.184
I don't know. A couple of minutes.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.984
Yeah, try doubling that.

09:46.984 --> 09:51.148
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.489
I think she's okay.

09:54.659 --> 09:55.956
Look at that!

09:56.160 --> 09:58.424
She pushes him away
and he won't budge!

09:58.663 --> 10:00.528
I'm gonna do something.

10:02.367 --> 10:03.766
We'll get a condo...

10:03.968 --> 10:06.835
... right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.833
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

10:10.341 --> 10:11.330
What?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.643
Ross Geller.

10:14.345 --> 10:17.644
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

10:19.350 --> 10:20.681
What are you doing?

10:20.885 --> 10:23.718
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

10:24.989 --> 10:26.354
I don't believe it!

10:26.624 --> 10:29.388
If it works out, we'll have
something to tell the grandkids!

10:29.694 --> 10:30.956
You sure will.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.890
I've gotta go.

10:33.631 --> 10:34.962
Take care.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.332
See you later.

10:39.971 --> 10:41.233
You're welcome.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.372
-What?
-I was saving you.

10:45.576 --> 10:49.307
Saving me from a pleasant
conversation with an interesting man?

10:49.514 --> 10:50.572
From where I was

10:50.848 --> 10:52.338
Okay, Ross, listen to me.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.211
I am not yours to save.

10:55.653 --> 10:57.086
But you are.

10:57.321 --> 10:58.151
What?

10:59.590 --> 11:00.887
You're my lobster.

11:04.762 --> 11:07.595
Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

11:08.933 --> 11:11.663
No, you're my lobster.

11:13.371 --> 11:14.338
Lobsters....

11:15.440 --> 11:17.874
In the tank, when they're old...

11:18.910 --> 11:22.903
...they get with the
They walk around holding the claws.

11:24.749 --> 11:26.273
In the tank!
You know, with...

11:27.452 --> 11:29.181
...with the holding and....

11:29.420 --> 11:32.287
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

11:32.523 --> 11:34.388
Do the claws again.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.520
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

11:38.796 --> 11:40.559
Let's talk
What about us?

11:40.765 --> 11:44.030
Ross, there is no "us," okay?

11:45.136 --> 11:46.694
No! Listen to me!

11:46.904 --> 11:49.134
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

11:49.673 --> 11:52.574
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

11:52.777 --> 11:56.440
I'm tired of being
clobbered, you know?

11:56.714 --> 11:58.238
It's just not worth it.

11:58.516 --> 11:59.710
Well, but

11:59.917 --> 12:01.782
No "but," Ross.

12:02.052 --> 12:05.920
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

12:07.725 --> 12:09.090
Except that what?

12:11.595 --> 12:13.688
No. No.

12:14.431 --> 12:17.594
Accept that.

12:37.077 --> 12:40.604
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

12:42.316 --> 12:45.149
You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

12:47.321 --> 12:50.449
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh?

12:53.327 --> 12:54.919
Okay, that's my bad.

12:56.530 --> 12:59.761
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.968
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

13:02.169 --> 13:05.104
...say how much
our friendship means to me?

13:05.306 --> 13:09.174
But you insulted the bracelet
and you made fun of me.

13:09.777 --> 13:12.473
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

13:12.780 --> 13:15.544
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

13:16.544 --> 13:18.944
I am focus on this.

13:22.544 --> 13:24.544
How we argue that

13:26.117 --> 13:29.052
Come on, man! I said I was
sorry a hundred times.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.720
I promise, I will never
take it off my...

13:32.724 --> 13:33.713
...wrist.

13:37.161 --> 13:39.789
But if you want to
stay in there and be mad...

13:39.997 --> 13:41.988
...you just, you stay in there.

13:42.333 --> 13:43.857
You know what the

13:44.635 --> 13:46.125
I am here, on my knees...

13:48.206 --> 13:50.697
... holding up these couch cushions...

13:50.908 --> 13:53.638
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

13:54.912 --> 13:58.040
Much like they did
in biblical times.

13:58.249 --> 14:00.149
Though you may haveth anger now....

14:03.149 --> 14:05.549
You are gonna grab something, aren't you.

14:10.990 --> 14:14.050
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

14:15.528 --> 14:17.519
I'm just saying!
It's right there!

14:18.398 --> 14:19.228
Hey, guys.

14:19.432 --> 14:20.899
Hi, darling.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.765
Where is my grandson, You didn't bring him?

14:24.003 --> 14:26.904
He's at Carol and Susan's today.

14:27.106 --> 14:29.370
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

14:31.210 --> 14:32.541
I'm just saying!

14:33.612 --> 14:38.015
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

14:43.022 --> 14:45.183
-Where have you been?
-Emotional hell.

14:45.424 --> 14:46.948
Did they lend you the money?

14:47.192 --> 14:49.023
No, I haven't asked them yet.

14:49.228 --> 14:50.889
Come on, Monica, do it.

14:51.096 --> 14:52.529
Hey, you guys.

14:53.198 --> 14:54.859
Monica has some news.

14:56.201 --> 15:00.365
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

15:01.373 --> 15:05.104
... I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

15:05.311 --> 15:06.209
Why?

15:06.712 --> 15:08.577
Because they made me.

15:09.815 --> 15:13.717
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

15:13.919 --> 15:18.219
Judy, relax. This is our little
Harmonica we're talking about.

15:18.457 --> 15:19.651
We taught her well.

15:19.892 --> 15:24.056
-Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
-ln the bank.

15:24.863 --> 15:27.991
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.599
She's gonna be fine. Aren't you sweetie.

15:33.035 --> 15:34.866
If you need a little extra...

15:35.070 --> 15:37.231
...you know where to find it.

15:37.473 --> 15:39.498
Anything larger back there?

15:41.343 --> 15:42.867
I can't believe it!

15:43.145 --> 15:44.669
Would you stop already?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.872
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.574
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

15:50.819 --> 15:55.085
I just dropped $400 to replace
a bracelet I hated to begin with.

15:55.324 --> 15:57.053
Bring on the hay!

15:57.860 --> 15:58.690
Hey!

16:01.063 --> 16:03.429
I've got something
that'll make you happy.

16:03.665 --> 16:05.394
Guess what Gunther found?

16:08.036 --> 16:09.503
Hey, now you have two!

16:11.707 --> 16:13.004
Oh, now you have two.

16:16.044 --> 16:17.705
What am I gonna do?

16:23.585 --> 16:25.212
How come you have two?

16:26.922 --> 16:28.048
This one's for you.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.121
Get out!

16:30.392 --> 16:31.859
No, I can't.

16:34.296 --> 16:36.526
I know how much this means to you...

16:36.732 --> 16:38.962
...and this is about more than jewelry.

16:39.201 --> 16:42.728
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."

16:45.407 --> 16:47.773
Is this friendship?
I think so!

16:49.311 --> 16:51.905
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

16:52.481 --> 16:54.574
That's what they'll call us!

16:56.718 --> 16:59.778
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

17:00.456 --> 17:02.117
You have dinosaur checks?

17:03.992 --> 17:06.688
You get your money
and you learn something.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.157
What's wrong with that?

17:08.397 --> 17:09.625
Nothing.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.492
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

17:14.636 --> 17:18.003
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.673
Hey, Mon, what is this?

17:22.110 --> 17:26.137
That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

17:27.416 --> 17:30.852
I thought they used that
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

17:32.354 --> 17:34.254
Hey, what's on this videotape?

17:34.456 --> 17:36.117
I don't know.
Let's put it in.

17:46.168 --> 17:48.432
Over here, Jack. Okay.

17:48.637 --> 17:50.764
Rachel's coming up the path.

17:50.973 --> 17:53.134
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?

17:53.342 --> 17:54.502
Can you get this?

17:57.513 --> 17:59.037
Oh, my God!

17:59.715 --> 18:01.205
What is with your nose?

18:03.886 --> 18:07.686
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

18:08.023 --> 18:11.959
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

18:12.828 --> 18:14.989
This is us getting ready
for the prom.

18:16.398 --> 18:17.865
We don't have to watch.

18:18.066 --> 18:18.896
Yeah, we do.

18:19.134 --> 18:20.533
-Come on!
-It's fun!

18:20.802 --> 18:22.167
Get a shot of Monica.

18:22.404 --> 18:23.234
Where's Monica?

18:23.505 --> 18:24.870
Over here, Dad!

18:25.841 --> 18:28.002
Wait. How do you zoom out?

18:29.645 --> 18:31.738
There she is!

18:35.217 --> 18:36.980
Some girl ate Monica!

18:39.221 --> 18:42.190
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

18:42.491 --> 18:44.982
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

18:48.230 --> 18:50.164
Oh, you look so great!

18:50.399 --> 18:53.163
So do you! You look beautiful!

18:53.936 --> 18:54.925
-Oops.
- What?

18:55.237 --> 18:57.102
I think I got mayonnaise on you.

18:57.339 --> 18:59.830
Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.

19:02.678 --> 19:03.940
Everybody smile!

19:04.713 --> 19:06.203
Oh, Dad, turn it off!

19:06.448 --> 19:07.278
It is off.

19:07.482 --> 19:09.746
It is not!
What's with the red light?

19:09.952 --> 19:11.544
It's the off light.

19:11.787 --> 19:13.254
Right, Ross?

19:21.296 --> 19:23.423
Looking good, Mr. IKotter.

19:27.603 --> 19:30.367
- You look pretty tonight.
-Oh, thanks.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.640
- What are you doing this summer?
-I'm gonna hang out...

19:36.912 --> 19:38.903
... work on my music.

19:42.551 --> 19:45.782
Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.

19:52.628 --> 19:54.653
Let me see. I don't know.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.496
What are you gonna do...

19:56.765 --> 19:58.562
The guys are here!

19:58.800 --> 19:59.926
... this summer?

20:00.135 --> 20:01.227
Work on your music?

20:07.142 --> 20:09.076
Oh, my God!
There's Roy Gublik!

20:09.745 --> 20:13.511
You know, Roy saw
Star Wars 317 times.

20:13.815 --> 20:14.975
He was in the paper.

20:16.952 --> 20:19.785
Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?

20:19.988 --> 20:22.752
He'll be here, okay?
Take a chill pill.

20:24.126 --> 20:25.184
There.

20:30.632 --> 20:33.760
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

20:36.937 --> 20:41.203
I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!

20:41.542 --> 20:44.375
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go.

20:44.645 --> 20:47.136
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

20:48.849 --> 20:50.976
I have a wonderful idea.

20:51.185 --> 20:53.949
You should take Rachel to the prom.

20:55.122 --> 20:55.986
Doubtful.

20:56.223 --> 20:59.124
Jack, give me that.
Talk to your son.

21:00.695 --> 21:02.890
All right, go on.
This thing's heavy.

21:03.130 --> 21:06.691
Your mother's right.
Take her. You can wear my tux.

21:06.901 --> 21:08.368
She won't wanna go with me.

21:08.636 --> 21:11.537
Of course she would!
You're a college man!

21:12.139 --> 21:14.004
-I don't know.
- Well, come on.

21:14.241 --> 21:16.038
Don't you wanna find out?

21:17.478 --> 21:19.742
I can't believe
I can't go to the prom!

21:19.980 --> 21:21.504
This is so harsh!

21:26.153 --> 21:29.145
-Hold my board.
- Thataboy! Thataboy!

21:29.590 --> 21:31.217
I think we've seen enough.

21:31.425 --> 21:32.517
Let's turn it off.

21:33.761 --> 21:35.422
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

21:36.497 --> 21:38.158
Come on, kid. Let's go!

21:40.401 --> 21:44.030
-My! Are you handsome!
-Let's show them!

21:44.271 --> 21:45.932
Just a sec, Dad.

21:46.907 --> 21:49.398
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

21:59.253 --> 22:00.083
Okay, Dad.

22:00.354 --> 22:04.222
Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining

22:04.425 --> 22:05.687
Oh, no.

22:06.594 --> 22:07.856
Don't wait up!

22:08.262 --> 22:09.422
Chip!

22:11.766 --> 22:12.755
Oh, dear!

22:13.601 --> 22:15.228
How do I turn this off?

22:15.636 --> 22:16.762
Press the button.

22:16.971 --> 22:18.905
Which one? Which button? Jack!

22:19.106 --> 22:20.733
The button! The button!

22:24.745 --> 22:26.940
I can't believe you did that.

22:30.484 --> 22:31.542
Yeah, well....

23:00.181 --> 23:02.513
See? He's her lobster!

23:11.324 --> 23:12.621
Dance with him!

23:13.159 --> 23:14.626
Mom, I'm hungry!

23:15.094 --> 23:16.823
Dance with your father.

23:17.030 --> 23:21.364
I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.829
All right.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.643
-Oh, Jack!
-Oh, Judy!
