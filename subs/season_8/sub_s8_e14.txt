WEBVTT

00:07.707 --> 00:10.335
-What's up?
-I left my guitar here.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.010
Okay. No problem.

00:15.582 --> 00:18.312
Okay. Here you go.

00:23.123 --> 00:26.149
-What?
-You want to hang out or something?

00:26.793 --> 00:29.125
You caught me at a bad time.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.991
-Are you and Chandler..?
-Exactly.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.097
-Can I play for you?
-No.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.837
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

00:42.642 --> 00:46.601
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

00:50.250 --> 00:55.688
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.618
Phoebe, I can explain.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.492
You see..

01:00.660 --> 01:03.185
God, I gotta get better at lying.

01:03.663 --> 01:06.223
You said you hate massages.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.665
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

01:12.338 --> 01:14.829
How long has this been going on?

01:15.241 --> 01:18.802
-Well, Alexandra has..
-It has a name?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.142
Phoebe, don't get upset.

01:22.382 --> 01:27.649
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.722
Well, I thought I'd..

01:30.924 --> 01:32.755
Yeah, what the hell.

02:12.565 --> 02:16.194
One more push.
Come on, we're almost there.

02:16.469 --> 02:22.135
I'm happy things worked out for us
and we're having this baby. I love you.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.468
I love you too.

02:24.711 --> 02:27.805
I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say..

02:28.081 --> 02:30.675
you're the best sex I've ever had.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.813
That's always appropriate.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.687
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.317
There we go.

02:42.529 --> 02:48.832
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

02:56.643 --> 03:00.909
I hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

03:05.552 --> 03:06.814
Joey!

03:07.020 --> 03:10.114
-What's going on?
-Come feel my belly.

03:10.890 --> 03:14.326
-The baby's kicking for the first time.
-Really?

03:14.561 --> 03:16.051
Yes.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.854
You know what? Maybe you..

03:19.532 --> 03:24.265
Maybe you should come to me.
I'm not wearing any bottoms.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.707
Oh, my God.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.739
It's unbelievable!

03:31.010 --> 03:34.537
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like..

03:34.781 --> 03:37.773
Who's that annoying
girl soccer player?

03:38.017 --> 03:40.952
-Mia Hamm?
-Mia Hamm!

03:42.188 --> 03:45.555
-It's amazing.
-One hand on the sheet, Joe.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.851
Sorry.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.093
Hey, babe.

03:54.367 --> 03:59.464
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

04:00.173 --> 04:04.166
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

04:04.377 --> 04:08.074
-Maybe we can take it back.
-Where would we return it?

04:08.281 --> 04:11.409
How about to the street,
from the balcony?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.785
We can't do that.
What if they come by for a visit?

04:14.954 --> 04:18.651
Let's cross that bridge when my aunt
and uncle who I haven't seen in 15 years..

04:18.825 --> 04:21.623
drop by unexpectedly and
demand a giant bowl of punch.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.464
Why don't we just find a place for it?

04:29.202 --> 04:30.863
In that cabinet?

04:31.104 --> 04:36.599
That's for canned goods. Have you
forgotten everything from orientation?

04:38.845 --> 04:41.473
How about the closet by the bathroom?

04:41.681 --> 04:45.014
-Okay. Let me do it.
-No, I'll do it.

04:45.285 --> 04:50.279
You have to relax and let me
take care of things once in a while.

04:50.823 --> 04:54.782
It's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?

04:55.328 --> 04:58.354
No reason.
I keep private things in there.

04:58.665 --> 05:02.795
I've been here a while,
and I've never seen what's in there.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.993
What is in there?

05:05.738 --> 05:07.035
Feminine stuff.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.698
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

05:10.943 --> 05:17.542
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.520
-Fine.
-Thank you.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.585
Love you.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.361
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

05:36.469 --> 05:41.736
If it helps, Alexandra's only
been massaging her for three years.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.743
If! I said, if it helps.

05:48.748 --> 05:52.013
Why won't you let me massage you?

05:52.251 --> 05:56.779
I'd be self-conscious.
You're my friend. I'd be naked.

05:57.056 --> 06:00.890
We lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.586
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

06:06.599 --> 06:09.397
I'm curious about the human body.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.572
You can understand
why this would be weird.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.503
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.

06:16.709 --> 06:21.408
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Give me a chance. Please?

06:22.081 --> 06:24.276
If it means that much to you.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.509
It does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

06:28.755 --> 06:33.055
Or how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.290
-Dinosaurs.
-Potato, potahto.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.493
Ross, the baby's kicking.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.795
What? It is?

06:51.010 --> 06:53.103
It's not kicking now.

06:53.312 --> 06:57.715
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.849
When? What happened?

07:00.086 --> 07:03.817
Last night. I went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.651
A dreamless sleep.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.091
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

07:11.330 --> 07:16.893
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

07:17.136 --> 07:20.867
I got some stuff going on
if you want to feel.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.572
I'll pass, but you look radiant.

07:27.180 --> 07:32.117
I don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.913
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.283
I don't care if it's 3 a.m.
and you want ice cream.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.120
Can I get a copy of that?

07:46.065 --> 07:49.626
-Are you under the sheet?
-Yes.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.239
Great, let's begin.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.014
How's the pressure?

08:04.917 --> 08:08.114
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.152
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

08:11.424 --> 08:15.485
-And it's not weird, is it?
-No.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.724
That's right, you just enjoy.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.293
Oh, yeah!

08:30.276 --> 08:34.679
-Oh, yeah!
-Okay.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.441
Oh, God, Phoebe!

08:38.684 --> 08:42.814
That's it! That's it, right there!

08:54.867 --> 08:58.303
I wasn't trying to open
your closet, I swear.

08:59.338 --> 09:05.208
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

09:05.411 --> 09:08.676
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see it.

09:08.881 --> 09:13.318
-Why not?
-I don't know! What's she hiding?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.714
I don't know.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.413
I bet it's Richard.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.220
-What?
-Before you say I'm wrong..

09:21.394 --> 09:22.725
let me ask you something.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.920
When was the last time you saw him?

09:25.865 --> 09:28.425
Why would she keep Richard in here?

09:28.668 --> 09:30.898
Off the top of my head..

09:31.170 --> 09:34.537
maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.176
You being the "cake,"
Richard being the "too."

09:38.544 --> 09:41.445
-That was off the top of your head?
-Yeah.

09:42.648 --> 09:46.277
-Or..
-And here we go.

09:46.485 --> 09:51.013
I saw a movie where there was a door.
Nobody knew what was behind it.

09:51.290 --> 09:55.989
When they finally got it open,
millions of bugs came pouring out..

09:56.195 --> 09:59.722
and they feasted on human flesh!

10:00.666 --> 10:04.534
It wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

10:08.507 --> 10:12.443
Stupid closet full of bugs!

10:13.512 --> 10:18.211
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't..

10:18.384 --> 10:20.614
When my sisters were pregnant..

10:20.786 --> 10:24.187
they got weird feelings
and it was always nothing.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.118
-Really?
-Absolutely.

10:26.325 --> 10:30.762
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.

10:30.997 --> 10:37.197
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.
Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.495
Crushing bones!

10:39.705 --> 10:43.038
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.835
-Open it.
-Why'd you..

10:45.011 --> 10:47.070
Watch your feet.
There's bugs everywhere.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.216
-So?
-She's fine.

10:58.424 --> 11:03.487
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.
Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.

11:03.696 --> 11:08.690
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

11:08.901 --> 11:10.732
-Everything's normal?
-Yes.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.131
-There's no danger?
-No.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.502
Contractions can be unnerving,
but she's fine.

11:16.742 --> 11:21.543
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

11:21.747 --> 11:25.774
I wasn't calm! I've never been
more scared in my life.

11:26.218 --> 11:31.019
-You said everything was okay.
-What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.156
-But everything is okay. I'm fine.
-You sure?

11:35.361 --> 11:39.195
Yes. I got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.492
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

11:42.735 --> 11:44.396
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.697
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital." What happened?

11:47.907 --> 11:51.843
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.138
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.542
No uterus, no opinion.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.246
What's with the candy?

12:01.454 --> 12:04.787
I was at the concession stand
at the movies.

12:05.024 --> 12:08.790
-You went to the movies by yourself?
-Mona!

12:10.062 --> 12:12.860
-I gotta go back in there.
-What's wrong?

12:13.065 --> 12:17.468
-I just gotta..
-No, really, tell me. What's up?

12:17.703 --> 12:21.230
Look, I forgot my underwear.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.912
Thanks for bringing her to the hospital.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.946
Don't worry about it. No big deal.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.948
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.318
-Here's information on Braxton Hicks.
-Thanks.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.492
You did the right thing by bringing her in.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.195
You'll make a wonderful father.

12:45.698 --> 12:50.829
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

12:57.176 --> 13:01.340
-There has got to be a way.
-Easy there, Captain Kirk.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.849
-Do you have a bobby pin?
-Yeah.

13:06.118 --> 13:10.145
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.583
Then why do you throw like one?

13:13.559 --> 13:17.154
-Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
-Oh, sure, "Monica."

13:18.764 --> 13:22.165
So how's the inappropriate
crush on Rachel coming?

13:22.368 --> 13:26.828
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

13:27.072 --> 13:30.337
Well, you sure found that quick.

13:33.479 --> 13:38.678
I wish I didn't feel this way about
Rachel. I wish things could be normal.

13:38.884 --> 13:43.878
I love living with her, and
helping out with the baby is amazing.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.284
But now I think Ross feels left out.

13:47.526 --> 13:52.793
When I took Rachel to the hospital,
the doctor thought I was the father.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.297
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

13:56.502 --> 14:01.235
I have no idea what I'm doing.
For all I know, I'm locking it more.

14:01.841 --> 14:06.039
-You try opening it with a credit card?
-That's a good idea.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.907
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

14:10.149 --> 14:13.118
-I feel terrible.
-It's not your fault.

14:13.319 --> 14:17.517
What are you gonna do, not take her?
You're doing nothing wrong.

14:17.756 --> 14:21.192
Except for harboring love
for the woman carrying his baby.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.623
Well, there is that.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.899
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

14:36.408 --> 14:41.243
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
That massage felt so good.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.812
No, I got that.

14:44.016 --> 14:47.713
-Can we make it a weekly appointment?
-Okay.

14:47.987 --> 14:53.050
You should know though,
I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.194
-Okay.
-I mean 500.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.186
-What?
-600.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.865
What's going on?

15:01.066 --> 15:04.263
You make sex noises
when you get massaged.

15:04.503 --> 15:09.839
It freaked me out. After a while,
I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.

15:10.075 --> 15:14.205
You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises I make.

15:14.446 --> 15:17.347
There's nothing sexual about this?

15:17.549 --> 15:20.017
Oh, God!

15:22.888 --> 15:26.016
What are you looking at?

15:26.358 --> 15:27.791
I mean, hi.

15:29.728 --> 15:34.495
Oh, that's why Alexandra wears earplugs
when she gives me a massage.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.999
It's not because she hates Enya.

15:37.169 --> 15:40.832
This is embarrassing.
I'm never getting a massage again.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.066
Don't let this stop you
from getting massages.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.871
I have lots of clients
that make those noises.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.674
-Really?
-Well, not clients. Lovers.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.184
We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

15:57.389 --> 16:00.222
-You sure?
-Yes.

16:00.426 --> 16:04.624
-I guess.
-Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

16:04.897 --> 16:08.560
So did you hear something you liked?

16:12.204 --> 16:16.265
Hey, Ross, check it out!
I learned a new trick.

16:17.609 --> 16:21.739
You know, if you stick one hand down your
pants, you're the spitting image of Joey.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.582
Hey, I brought you some lunch.

16:26.819 --> 16:31.017
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.223
-Did you put pickles on this?
-Well, yeah.

16:39.031 --> 16:42.523
What? What? Rach, what?

16:42.768 --> 16:45.760
-What's going on?
-I made her tuna with pickle.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.667
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

16:48.874 --> 16:52.901
Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.040
I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?

16:56.248 --> 17:00.184
I'm fine, but someone make sure
it's gone when I get out?

17:00.386 --> 17:02.513
I'm on it!

17:04.256 --> 17:07.714
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.

17:07.926 --> 17:12.260
-lt could happen to anyone.
-Not to you. You know this stuff.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.228
I don't know any of it and I'm the father.

17:15.434 --> 17:19.393
I wish I could be more involved, you know?

17:23.242 --> 17:29.010
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.

17:29.915 --> 17:33.578
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.277
-Yeah.
-What's up?

17:36.889 --> 17:40.723
Sit down.
I wanna talk about our situation.

17:40.926 --> 17:43.759
Are you breaking up with us?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.323
The thing is..

17:49.535 --> 17:54.666
because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of stuff.

17:54.940 --> 17:59.343
And Ross is missing everything. So..

17:59.578 --> 18:01.045
Yeah?

18:02.247 --> 18:04.909
You two should live together.

18:05.117 --> 18:08.109
Are you asking me to move?
You don't want me here?

18:08.320 --> 18:12.780
No, I love living with you.
It just seems that..

18:13.058 --> 18:17.358
if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

18:17.596 --> 18:23.626
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in and disrupt his life.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.602
Or he does.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.368
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.978
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

18:36.181 --> 18:40.117
-But it's you and me.
-lt wouldn't be anything romantic.

18:40.319 --> 18:44.278
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

18:45.124 --> 18:49.458
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

18:49.995 --> 18:52.964
So, what do you think?

18:53.132 --> 18:56.499
Living with the father of the baby.
It's a little conventional for us.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.670
Yeah, but hey, hey.
You always have liked my building.

18:59.838 --> 19:04.070
And there's more room. I mean,
you could have a closet dedicated to shoes.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.609
Oh, you do know your audience.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.581
-I don't know. Is it crazy?
-No.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.807
Joey, this is a smart idea.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.483
Well, I was due.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.223
-Let's do it.
-Really?

19:19.458 --> 19:22.689
Rach, that's great. That's great.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.928
And you know what?
Don't worry about any of the moving.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.864
I'll take care of everything.
In fact, I'll start right now.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.598
Ross, Ross. Mona?

19:32.771 --> 19:34.033
Unbelievable.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.373
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself..

19:46.585 --> 19:49.315
using my wife's tools.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.690
Oh, my God.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.694
How did you get in there?

20:06.371 --> 20:08.168
You're messy.

20:08.574 --> 20:14.513
-No! You weren't supposed to see this!
-I married Fred Sanford.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.443
Chandler, you don't understand.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.441
You know,
how I organize everything, right?

20:20.619 --> 20:24.578
Okay, well this is all of the stuff
that doesn't fit into any category.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.150
So you see, I'm not messy.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.318
I'm just so organized that..

20:34.967 --> 20:39.802
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.
I'm sick.

20:40.005 --> 20:45.204
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.504
I love you in spite of that.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.611
Really?

20:51.483 --> 20:54.452
-Promise you won't tell anyone?
-Yes.

20:54.653 --> 21:00.421
Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff,
can we share the closet?

21:00.626 --> 21:03.754
Well.. It's just..

21:03.996 --> 21:06.863
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.296
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:14.473 --> 21:19.433
So Rachel's all moved out?
How you taking it?

21:19.678 --> 21:22.545
I wanted to have a few beers..

21:22.814 --> 21:26.978
but I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell.

21:27.185 --> 21:30.848
I have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium.

21:31.123 --> 21:36.891
It's a couple weeks past its expiration
date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

21:39.564 --> 21:43.967
-Are you okay?
-You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

21:44.169 --> 21:47.468
I'm better than great. I am good.

21:49.274 --> 21:55.679
Now that she's gone, I can do stuff
around here that I couldn't do before.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.781
Like..

21:57.983 --> 22:00.474
I can walk around naked again.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.584
I can..

22:02.821 --> 22:06.313
I can watch porn in the living room.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.926
This is good for me.

22:09.194 --> 22:14.291
I like being on my own.
I'm better off this way.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.933
I'm a lone wolf.

22:17.169 --> 22:21.105
A loner. Alone.

22:21.506 --> 22:26.102
All alone. Forever.

22:28.814 --> 22:32.682
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

22:40.192 --> 22:43.252
That's it, just relax.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.798
-Come on, more.
-Oh, God!

22:48.033 --> 22:50.593
You like that, don't you?

22:50.869 --> 22:55.363
-Yeah, right there.
-Want it there? Take it there, baby.

22:57.242 --> 23:01.201
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, say my name. Say it.

23:09.788 --> 23:13.087
And now I'm going
to cover you back up.

23:13.792 --> 23:18.229
And I won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.
