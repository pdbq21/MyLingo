-Hey.
-Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

00:05.110 --> 00:08.014
Look, can we talk
about what happened here last night?

00:08.182 --> 00:11.917
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.

00:12.457 --> 00:17.992
You believe that whoever did something
last night did what they did or didn't do?

00:18.670 --> 00:21.300
Okay, you really don't know
what l'm talking about?

00:21.510 --> 00:23.980
-No.
-Okay. Last night, after the party...

00:24.148 --> 00:27.747
...l saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.

00:27.955 --> 00:29.355
Our balcony? Seriously?

00:29.526 --> 00:32.896
That's so funny. l told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony...

00:33.066 --> 00:36.733
...and she said, ''No, no. lt's too cold.
Nobody will go out there.'' And l said:

00:36.907 --> 00:39.377
''Maybe if we put some lights
out there they will.''

00:41.783 --> 00:45.415
Right, that's what l came over to talk
about. l saw Rachel kissing some guy...

00:45.591 --> 00:49.360
...on your balcony,
even though there were no lights!

00:50.568 --> 00:53.300
So are you gonna talk to her?

00:53.507 --> 00:57.344
Why? Why should l? l mean,
if she wants to move on, that's fine.

00:57.548 --> 01:01.112
You know when ''that's fine'' sounds
true? When someone yells it and spits.

01:01.890 --> 01:06.594
No, l'm serious. l mean, if she wants
to date people, fine. l don't care.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.929
But at least she could have told me.

01:09.104 --> 01:12.600
You know, l've been putting my life
on hold and concentrating on Emma.

01:12.845 --> 01:18.447
But if she wants to go out there kissing
guys she barely knows, then so will l.

01:21.362 --> 01:23.765
Very funny! Ross is gay!

01:25.303 --> 01:27.136
No, no.
Good, so you're moving on.

01:27.307 --> 01:29.801
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?

01:30.013 --> 01:31.915
l've got plenty of opportunities.

01:32.083 --> 01:36.582
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

01:36.760 --> 01:42.294
And then the other day on the subway,
a woman ''accidentally'' sat on my hand.

01:42.972 --> 01:47.310
Dude, don't rub my face
in your crazy single life.

01:47.915 --> 01:50.215
And there's an anthropologist
at school...

01:50.420 --> 01:54.155
...who totally came on to me during
the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

01:54.361 --> 01:56.992
Why did l get married?

02:47.267 --> 02:49.898
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

02:50.139 --> 02:51.938
l'm having new headshots
taken tomorrow.

02:52.110 --> 02:55.446
The photographer said she thinks
l should have my eyebrows waxed.

02:55.651 --> 02:57.951
ls that weird for a guy?

02:58.289 --> 03:00.452
-Well, it depends.
-On?

03:00.661 --> 03:03.496
On how far along he is
in the sex-change process.

03:05.169 --> 03:09.132
No, l totally disagree. l think it's fine
for a guy to do something like that.

03:09.311 --> 03:10.905
Especially an actor.

03:11.115 --> 03:13.985
l mean, not that you need to.
Your eyebrows are....

03:18.195 --> 03:20.996
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.502
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

03:24.341 --> 03:27.006
Oh, man, now l have to get
those done too?

03:27.213 --> 03:31.278
-Wow, talk about high maintenance.
-You dye your hair.

03:31.488 --> 03:34.689
-l'm a woman.
-Double standards!

03:35.998 --> 03:38.970
Before l forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?

03:39.171 --> 03:43.009
-Only if l don't have to get up and sing.
-But everybody sings. lt's so fun.

03:43.179 --> 03:47.347
Last time, this adorable old man got up
there, forgot all the words, flipped out...

03:47.521 --> 03:51.894
...and everyone booed him off the stage.
lt was so funny.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.567
Look, l'm not good at singing.

03:55.771 --> 03:59.905
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid l'm a better singer?

04:00.079 --> 04:02.276
You afraid l'm gonna beat you
at singing?

04:04.589 --> 04:08.050
Nope. Nope. lt's not working on me.

04:08.229 --> 04:11.258
Wow, l must be growing up.

04:12.938 --> 04:17.311
Okay, fine. Just please come and
support Mike. You don't have to sing.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.682
So l don't have to sing, and l can just sit
there and pass judgment on others?

04:21.890 --> 04:24.122
-While drinking.
-l'm there.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.126
Hi, you guys.
Listen, l really need your help.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.808
l think l did something
really stupid.

04:31.976 --> 04:35.643
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something
so beautiful out of it.

04:38.289 --> 04:41.090
No, not that.
l kissed Gavin last night.

04:41.295 --> 04:42.354
-My God.
-You kissed him?

04:42.531 --> 04:45.127
Yeah, it was after the party,
we were on the balcony--

04:45.336 --> 04:48.673
Wait, wait, wait. l was at home
the whole time. How did l miss that?

04:48.877 --> 04:53.011
Well, it was the end of the party. You
were probably ironing wrapping paper.

04:53.853 --> 04:55.446
Oh, yeah.

04:58.162 --> 05:00.029
So how did you end up kissing?

05:00.266 --> 05:02.567
We were all alone
and he was being really nice...

05:02.771 --> 05:05.971
-...and he gave me this scarf.
-l thought you hated him.

05:06.144 --> 05:08.877
Well, there is a thin line
between love and hate...

05:09.050 --> 05:13.651
...and it turns out that line
is a scarf.

05:15.530 --> 05:18.057
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?

05:18.235 --> 05:21.264
l don't know. lt's so complicated.
l work with this guy.

05:21.441 --> 05:25.006
l have the baby, and l have Ross.
l don't know what to do.

05:25.182 --> 05:28.416
And l have to be at the office
and see Gavin in 1 0 minutes.

05:28.623 --> 05:32.187
Sounds like you need to think
about what you want and talk to Gavin.

05:32.363 --> 05:36.326
-And you definitely should talk to Ross.
-Or...

05:36.939 --> 05:40.070
...l could call in sick
and not deal with it at all.

05:41.114 --> 05:44.086
Wow! Five months maternity leave,
you're back for four days...

05:44.254 --> 05:48.559
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.

05:56.512 --> 05:57.605
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:57.781 --> 06:02.587
-l'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
-Name?

06:02.791 --> 06:04.522
Chandler Bing.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.467
Okay, very good.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.836
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.

06:12.009 --> 06:14.104
Okay. Thanks.

06:59.572 --> 07:02.510
l touched the stuff.

07:03.312 --> 07:05.579
l'll take care of it.

07:09.658 --> 07:11.126
Thanks.

07:11.294 --> 07:14.391
So do you...?
Do you get a lot of guys in here?

07:14.568 --> 07:17.334
-Oh, absolutely.
-Oh, good.

07:17.574 --> 07:21.172
-You looking to meet somebody?
-All right, let's just do this.

07:22.416 --> 07:25.013
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

07:25.189 --> 07:27.956
First, l want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?

07:28.128 --> 07:32.091
-Now, this may sting just a little bit.
-l have an extremely high threshold--

07:32.270 --> 07:36.335
Holy Mother of God!
Oh, my face! My face!

07:42.390 --> 07:44.691
l'm all right. l'm all right. l'm all right.

07:44.862 --> 07:48.232
lt's just a bit of shock, that's all.

07:48.402 --> 07:52.867
-But l'll be fine. You can go again.
-Okay.

07:56.384 --> 07:58.047
Sorry.

08:03.398 --> 08:05.869
Damn it, woman!

08:19.197 --> 08:22.602
lt's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?

08:24.273 --> 08:28.304
Not well. l went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...

08:28.482 --> 08:32.445
...but that person was neither female
nor wearing pants.

08:33.893 --> 08:37.833
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way. l mean, think about it:

08:38.001 --> 08:42.465
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.

08:44.715 --> 08:47.345
The personal ad writes itself.

08:48.355 --> 08:52.318
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?

08:53.833 --> 08:57.135
What are you doing?
You know l can only dish it out.

08:57.874 --> 09:02.372
l can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.

09:02.551 --> 09:04.179
Maybe she didn't move on.

09:04.353 --> 09:07.986
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.

09:08.161 --> 09:11.156
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.462
-Did she go out with him?
-No. When he called...

09:13.639 --> 09:15.130
...l threw the message away.

09:16.979 --> 09:18.972
The high road.

09:19.718 --> 09:24.182
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. l have to get moving.

09:24.795 --> 09:29.429
Hey, check out those two blonds
over there. Hey, come with me.

09:29.671 --> 09:32.301
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?

09:32.911 --> 09:36.372
You don't have to do anything.
lt'll just be easier if it's two of us.

09:36.552 --> 09:40.890
Like college, remember? First, you
break the ice with some kind of a joke...

09:41.060 --> 09:45.125
...so they know you're the funny one. l
swoop in with interesting conversation...

09:45.335 --> 09:49.572
...so they'll see that l'm the brilliant,
brooding, sexy one.

09:52.617 --> 09:54.985
l thought l got to make the jokes.

09:56.792 --> 09:59.958
-Don't you have to be at work?
-Oh, come on.

10:02.637 --> 10:07.636
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.

10:07.814 --> 10:09.407
We were wondering...

10:09.585 --> 10:13.582
...if you're up for it, we only need
six more people for a human pyramid.

10:15.997 --> 10:17.465
Swoop. Swoop.

10:21.508 --> 10:25.311
Hey, l notice
you're reading the paper.

10:25.482 --> 10:27.817
Another flood in Europe, huh?

10:30.192 --> 10:32.287
Here's a question:

10:33.566 --> 10:38.702
Would you rather drown
or be burned alive?

10:40.045 --> 10:44.486
-l'm sorry, we're just leaving.
-Okay.

10:47.594 --> 10:49.324
We still got it.

10:58.381 --> 11:02.412
-Who is it?
-Gavin. l brought you some soup.

11:02.590 --> 11:05.083
-Why?
-l heard you were sick.

11:05.262 --> 11:09.134
Oh, right! Hold on,
let me just clean up in here a little bit.

11:19.891 --> 11:22.020
Hello, Gavin.

11:22.964 --> 11:24.900
l missed you at work.
How you feeling?

11:25.102 --> 11:28.803
l'm not gonna lie to you, l'm pretty sick.

11:28.976 --> 11:32.142
Oh, good. Because l was having
a totally paranoid moment...

11:32.316 --> 11:34.549
...where l thought you
called in sick to avoid me.

11:34.755 --> 11:37.659
Oh, no, no, no.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.502
So l had fun last night.

11:43.271 --> 11:45.173
So did l.

11:47.881 --> 11:50.113
Exactly how contagious
is this thing you have?

11:50.285 --> 11:55.524
ls it a cold from standing on
the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

11:56.097 --> 11:58.967
-lt's just a cold.
-Do you have a fever?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.402
Let me see.

12:07.152 --> 12:08.849
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

12:09.023 --> 12:11.517
What's Ross doing to you
in that picture?

12:11.695 --> 12:15.429
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

12:16.270 --> 12:19.037
He thought it would be funny.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.442
-Right. Right.
-Yeah.

12:21.648 --> 12:23.641
-Ross.
-Yeah.

12:24.420 --> 12:27.655
What's the deal with you guys? l don't
wanna get in the middle of anything.

12:27.861 --> 12:32.860
You're not getting in the middle
of anything. Don't worry about Ross.

12:33.071 --> 12:35.439
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

12:36.043 --> 12:38.309
-Hide! Hide!
-Yeah, but you said not to worry--

12:38.481 --> 12:41.282
l lied and l'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!

12:45.395 --> 12:48.458
-Hi.
-Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

12:48.636 --> 12:51.506
No. l'm here to take Emma
to your mother's, remember?

12:51.742 --> 12:53.301
Right. Yes, yes.

12:54.079 --> 12:56.345
-Don't panic.
-What?

12:56.518 --> 12:58.784
There is a man behind your curtain.

12:58.956 --> 13:02.589
-l have Mace in my purse.
-No, that's okay! No, no, no.

13:02.764 --> 13:07.797
This is my business associate Gavin
being silly. Come out from behind there.

13:09.043 --> 13:12.174
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

13:13.151 --> 13:15.622
lt was my idea to stand there.

13:15.790 --> 13:20.060
-Hello. l'll just go get Emma.
-Okay.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.496
So...

13:24.674 --> 13:28.477
-...why did l have to hide?
-l thought it was Ross.

13:28.649 --> 13:31.415
l thought there was nothing
going on between you.

13:31.655 --> 13:33.591
There isn't. There totally isn't.

13:33.792 --> 13:38.358
You hear keys in the hall and you jump
like a bronco coming out of the chute.

13:40.673 --> 13:42.836
l used to be a rodeo clown.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.314
All right, look, Gavin...

13:50.893 --> 13:54.765
...l guess l felt guilty
that you were here...

13:54.934 --> 13:56.927
...which l shouldn't.

13:57.105 --> 14:00.704
You know, Ross and l
are not in a relationship...

14:00.880 --> 14:05.412
...but he is the father of my child.
And, you know...

14:05.623 --> 14:09.221
...we do live together. And plus,
there's just so much history, you know?

14:09.396 --> 14:11.298
lt's just--
l don't know.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.602
-l'm sorry. l'm just all over the place.
-lt's okay.

14:16.611 --> 14:19.742
lt's probably not my place,
but can l give you a piece of advice?

14:19.918 --> 14:23.379
-Yes.
-You should talk to Ross about all this.

14:24.426 --> 14:26.897
People keep saying that.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.196
l'm sorry, Gavin.

14:31.407 --> 14:33.036
Don't be.

14:33.211 --> 14:35.910
lt's just bad timing.

14:37.185 --> 14:39.348
So seriously, rodeo clown?

14:40.225 --> 14:42.924
One of the best, ma'am.
One of the best.

15:11.287 --> 15:15.057
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.789
l'm gonna take a little break,
and when we come back...

15:18.000 --> 15:21.370
...we've got Kenneth singing
''l Touch Myself.''

15:22.042 --> 15:24.707
l'm not here to judge.

15:28.154 --> 15:31.388
-You have got to sing.
-No, l told you l can't.

15:31.595 --> 15:35.056
But you would have so much fun.
And you have a really nice voice.

15:35.736 --> 15:38.799
-When have you heard me sing?
-All the time, when you're cooking.

15:39.042 --> 15:40.602
-What?
-Yeah, you're always singing:

15:40.779 --> 15:43.580
<i>Yummy, yummy, yummy</i>
<i>I've got love in my tummy</i>

15:44.921 --> 15:46.584
Yeah, l do rock that one.

15:48.795 --> 15:51.961
lsn't there just a little part of you
that wants to get up there?

15:52.837 --> 15:56.207
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

15:56.377 --> 15:58.370
l don't even know what l would sing.

15:58.615 --> 16:01.279
-Well, l've got a book around--
-''Delta Dawn.''

16:09.871 --> 16:15.246
Hi. l couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.

16:15.415 --> 16:18.319
You already hit on me an hour ago.

16:19.991 --> 16:23.658
Right. So that's a firm no?

16:29.544 --> 16:32.447
l don't believe this.
l just keep striking out.

16:32.683 --> 16:35.085
l don't get it either.

16:35.254 --> 16:37.953
l mean, you're obviously desperate.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.964
You're asking women
how they wanna be killed.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.265
This is great.
Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

16:45.441 --> 16:49.313
...until she finds the one she wants,
and l'm gonna die alone.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.487
By drowning or...?

16:54.092 --> 16:58.123
-Why would he break up with me?
-l don't know, sweetie.

16:58.300 --> 17:02.605
All l ever wanted was to just love him
and have him love me back.

17:02.777 --> 17:06.512
l mean, am l so unlovable?

17:06.718 --> 17:09.815
-Wow.
-l know.

17:18.474 --> 17:21.139
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

17:21.313 --> 17:25.117
...much too literal rendition
of ''l Touch Myself.''

17:25.288 --> 17:29.388
Coming up next, we've got Monica
singing ''Delta Dawn.''

17:29.997 --> 17:32.490
Wait. l can't sing in
front of all these people.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.071
Just pretend they're not
even here. lt's okay.

17:35.241 --> 17:39.910
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so bright,
you won't see anyone anyway.

17:42.556 --> 17:47.190
Hi, l'm Monica. And l'm going
to be singing ''Delta Dawn.''

18:11.413 --> 18:15.878
-Can you totally see through her shirt?
-Like an x-ray.

18:16.758 --> 18:19.787
Bad day not to wear a bra.

18:36.496 --> 18:39.366
l'm calling about the advertising job.

18:39.537 --> 18:42.201
Yes, l realize it would be entry level.

18:43.210 --> 18:46.911
Oh, so would l actually
have to wear the chicken suit?

18:48.922 --> 18:51.415
l need your help.

18:53.464 --> 18:55.560
Wow, it seems serious.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.300
What seems to be the problem,
Ashley Judd?

18:59.476 --> 19:03.473
l'm getting new headshots taken.
So l went to get my eyebrows shaped.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.623
l'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.

19:07.325 --> 19:11.459
l may be a sissy, but l'll still
pound you into the ground.

19:11.668 --> 19:15.506
Look, it hurt so bad, l could only
let her do one eyebrow, and now...

19:15.676 --> 19:18.442
...they don't match!

19:31.173 --> 19:34.874
lt's like a baby caterpillar
chasing its mama.

19:35.047 --> 19:38.213
You got to help me out, okay?
Look, l have a magic marker.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.359
Fill in the skinny one
so l don't look stupid for my pictures.

19:41.561 --> 19:44.157
Okay, first of all, this is green.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.400
-What the hell am l supposed to do?!
-l will help you out...

19:47.573 --> 19:52.207
...but you have to promise you won't
tell anyone what l'm about to tell you.

19:52.382 --> 19:55.013
What? What?

19:55.354 --> 19:56.687
Okay.

19:56.858 --> 19:59.955
You know how most kids get their
allowance from mowing the lawn...

20:00.131 --> 20:04.732
...or taking out the garbage?
Well, l earned mine...

20:04.907 --> 20:10.874
...by plucking the eyebrows of my father
and his ''business partners.''

20:15.461 --> 20:17.294
Oh, my God.

20:17.699 --> 20:21.035
Yeah, well, l guess you don't need
my help, Victor-Victoria.

20:21.239 --> 20:24.268
No, no, no. l do. l do.
l need your help.

20:24.513 --> 20:28.111
But, Chandler, l don't know if l can take
any more plucking. lt hurt so bad.

20:28.320 --> 20:33.092
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aloe vera and my gentle...

20:33.263 --> 20:36.794
...self-loathing touch.

20:52.368 --> 20:55.135
l'm sorry, the song's over.

20:57.513 --> 21:00.679
-Did you see me up there?
-Every little bit of you.

21:02.088 --> 21:05.528
l can't believe l sang
in front of people and they liked me.

21:05.695 --> 21:08.325
Did you hear that guy shouting,
''Look at those tips''?

21:08.501 --> 21:12.372
l mean, did l really help
you get a lot of tips?

21:12.543 --> 21:13.670
Sure.

21:15.381 --> 21:18.980
-Mon, not that you didn't sound good....
-Good?

21:19.188 --> 21:22.593
Didn't you hear them? l was great!

21:22.763 --> 21:27.431
Thank you so much for making me
do this. That is the best gift ever.

21:27.673 --> 21:30.405
Also a good gift: underwear.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.784
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

21:37.024 --> 21:41.089
Public bathrooms freak me out. l can't
even pee, let alone do anything else.

21:41.534 --> 21:45.132
But what's great is
you don't mind talking about it.

21:45.307 --> 21:49.942
lt is so amazing that l met you on the
same day that Eric broke up with me...

21:50.117 --> 21:53.989
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.

21:56.329 --> 22:01.294
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. l am totally over Eric.

22:08.487 --> 22:11.015
Good choice, Ross.

22:12.763 --> 22:14.995
Hey. Hi. There you are.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.799
-l've been looking for you everywhere.
-Hello. Well, here l am.

22:19.008 --> 22:21.980
My mom is not bringing
the baby back until 9:00.

22:22.148 --> 22:26.681
So l was hoping you and l
could have a chance to kind of--

22:29.195 --> 22:31.962
-Somebody here?
-Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

22:32.134 --> 22:35.300
-Who?
-Oh, just this woman l've been seeing.

22:36.844 --> 22:40.180
-You've been seeing someone?
-Yeah, didn't l mention that?

22:40.350 --> 22:43.254
l mean, we haven't been
going out too long...

22:43.423 --> 22:47.329
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.

22:47.498 --> 22:51.268
l mean, in fact just before you came in,
she called me her boyfriend.

22:51.439 --> 22:55.505
l thought it was a little too soon,
but also, it felt kind of nice.

22:57.619 --> 23:01.456
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

23:06.704 --> 23:09.904
How great is this?
You're already comfortable enough...

23:10.077 --> 23:12.776
...to look through my stuff.

23:12.949 --> 23:15.419
l'm sorry, Michelle,
this is my roommate, Rachel.

23:15.622 --> 23:17.717
And l'm also Emma's mother.

23:18.460 --> 23:21.956
-Who's Emma?
-l told you about my daughter.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.605
This is your daughter?

23:25.508 --> 23:28.104
l could be your new mommy.

23:35.895 --> 23:37.626
And done.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.466
Oh, my God.

23:40.638 --> 23:43.735
l didn't feel a thing.
Hey, are you still looking for a job?

23:43.911 --> 23:47.475
Because you could tweeze circles
around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

23:48.888 --> 23:52.088
-Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
-Yeah.

23:53.731 --> 23:57.033
They totally match.
They look great.

23:57.204 --> 24:00.370
They look great. How you doing?

24:01.513 --> 24:04.815
Yeah, l think it looks pretty good.
l was a little worried l was...

24:05.020 --> 24:07.753
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...

24:07.926 --> 24:11.023
...but it turned out to be
a little piece of chocolate.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.760
-Chandler, thank you so much.
-No problem.

24:13.938 --> 24:17.399
Listen, that was a pretty
girlie hour we just spent.

24:17.579 --> 24:20.015
We should do something manly
to make up for it.

24:20.183 --> 24:22.415
Yeah.

24:25.662 --> 24:28.064
-Curl my eyelashes.
-Yeah!

24:31.172 --> 24:36.114
For my next song, l think l'll sing
something a little more upbeat, all right?

24:36.282 --> 24:40.279
How about the Pointer Sisters'
''l'm So Excited''?

24:40.457 --> 24:42.792
And make it bouncy.

24:42.963 --> 24:45.901
Well, you can probably take care of that
on your end.

24:46.870 --> 24:50.833
l'm sorry l'm late. You'll understand
when you see Joey.

24:51.012 --> 24:54.611
Honey, you're just in time.
l'm about to sing another song.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.519
-Really? ln front of all these people?
-And they love me.

24:57.692 --> 25:01.928
-Oh, my God.
-She gives the people what they want.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.662
All right, watch.

25:21.707 --> 25:24.804
Are those my wife's nipples?

25:25.180 --> 25:29.120
lsn't that funny? l didn't see that before.
l wouldn't have let her go up again.

25:29.288 --> 25:32.260
l've gotta stop this.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.089
Who cares? They still love me.

25:51.299 --> 25:55.034
You, touching yourself! Out!

26:00.818 --> 26:02.947
Wow! She does that a lot.

26:04.492 --> 26:07.954
Ross, you didn't tell me
you were a doctor.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.297
Wait a minute. You haven't even
told her you are a doctor yet?

26:11.472 --> 26:13.408
How long have you known her,
like an hour?

26:13.644 --> 26:16.741
Actually, about an hour and a half.

26:16.917 --> 26:21.518
l told you it wasn't long, but there's
an amazing connection between us.

26:21.693 --> 26:24.027
You feel that too?

26:24.198 --> 26:28.902
-l thought that that was just me.
-Are you kidding?

26:29.074 --> 26:33.037
-Do you wanna go away this weekend?
-We'll see.

26:34.118 --> 26:35.610
Ross, what's going on here?

26:35.821 --> 26:38.759
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?

26:38.928 --> 26:41.455
l don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on balconies?

26:42.034 --> 26:45.633
-How do you know about that?
-Through the magic of sight.

26:48.714 --> 26:53.052
-l was here, putting our child to sleep--
-Emma.

26:55.227 --> 26:58.222
When l looked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...

26:58.399 --> 27:00.392
...you've known for what, a week?

27:00.571 --> 27:04.408
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?

27:04.613 --> 27:08.108
No, actually, see, l had to pee
because l can't use public bathrooms...

27:08.286 --> 27:12.625
-...because of the doody parasites.
-Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

27:12.795 --> 27:15.528
-Well, call me.
-Okay.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.498
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.

27:17.705 --> 27:20.905
You know what?
lf it's meant to be, l'll guess it.

27:22.414 --> 27:24.715
Bye-bye.

27:25.453 --> 27:27.389
Score.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.290
Did you not like her? Because l was
hoping we could come...

27:30.463 --> 27:32.490
...to your kissing parties
on the balcony.

27:32.702 --> 27:36.232
l can't believe you are making a big deal
about this. lt was one kiss!

27:36.442 --> 27:39.039
-One guy. One time!
-Oh, really?

27:39.248 --> 27:41.879
-Yeah.
-Oh, really?

27:43.590 --> 27:45.456
Oh, yeah.

27:45.661 --> 27:48.393
-What about the guy from the bar?
-Who?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.731
The guy you gave your number to.

27:51.907 --> 27:56.211
-How do you know about that?
-Because he called here looking for you.

27:56.382 --> 28:00.517
So don't tell me kissing this guy
from work is a one-time thing.

28:00.725 --> 28:04.027
Because you've been out there
in bars and on balconies...

28:04.198 --> 28:08.366
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

28:09.241 --> 28:12.077
-Why didn't l get that message?
-What?

28:12.247 --> 28:16.051
From the guy in the bar?
Why didn't l get that message?

28:16.255 --> 28:19.421
Because l folded it up
and put it in my pants pocket.

28:19.596 --> 28:22.762
Do you not look there?

28:24.739 --> 28:26.264
Ross.

28:28.981 --> 28:31.474
l never gave it to you.

28:31.653 --> 28:33.349
Why?

28:35.093 --> 28:37.758
-l don't know.
-Oh, God, you know what? l don't....

28:37.932 --> 28:40.665
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...

28:40.838 --> 28:43.776
...what messages
l should or should not get?!

28:44.111 --> 28:46.878
Who am l? l'm the guy
who's taking care of our baby...

28:47.083 --> 28:50.351
-...while you're at bars meeting guys!
-l cannot believe you.

28:50.524 --> 28:54.726
l actually came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation with you about us.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.495
But l can't do that with someone
who hides my messages...

28:57.672 --> 29:00.508
...and brings crazy women
back to my apartment!

29:00.711 --> 29:05.015
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!

29:07.725 --> 29:10.720
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

29:10.898 --> 29:14.929
...you are the one who moved on
and didn't tell anyone.

29:15.173 --> 29:19.273
Oh, God, Ross,
this is just so messed up.

29:19.448 --> 29:23.583
What is wrong with us? When people
hear about our situation, they ask:

29:23.790 --> 29:26.785
''You live together, but you're not
a couple, yet you have a baby?

29:26.963 --> 29:31.165
lsn't that weird?'' And l say,
''No. lt's not, because it works for us.''

29:31.372 --> 29:33.274
But you know what?
This doesn't work.

29:33.442 --> 29:37.577
-ln fact, this is the opposite of working.
-Clearly.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.052
And you know...

29:41.225 --> 29:44.926
...we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense...

...and maybe this
just doesn't make sense anymore.

29:51.078 --> 29:53.515
Yeah, maybe not.

29:54.786 --> 29:57.256
So, what do you wanna do?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.261
Hi.

30:03.436 --> 30:06.876
Can Emma and l live here for a while?

30:07.110 --> 30:09.478
God.

30:10.183 --> 30:14.055
-Of course.
-Thank you.

30:18.265 --> 30:21.066
Your eyebrows look weird.

30:45.854 --> 30:48.849
