WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:03.633
Come on, Joey!

00:03.870 --> 00:06.270
I told you everything I knew
last night.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.202
It's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.005
I cannot believe you would say that!

00:13.213 --> 00:16.944
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are "making love."

00:18.051 --> 00:21.714
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

00:21.988 --> 00:24.889
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

00:25.392 --> 00:26.381
I don't know.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.392
God, I just can't imagine Chandler
being romantic.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.724
Is he romantic with her?

00:35.068 --> 00:36.057
I don't know.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.500
Are they in love?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.329
I don't know.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.609
You don't know anything.

00:44.844 --> 00:45.902
I know one thing.

00:46.746 --> 00:47.974
They did it right there.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.180
The One With Chandler's Work Laugh

01:41.434 --> 01:42.867
Could I have a scone?

01:43.269 --> 01:46.136
-Want to hear some good news?
-ls somebody else gonna give it to us?

01:46.306 --> 01:49.434
Because you certainly don't seem like
you have any.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.204
No, I do.
Someone I know is getting married.

01:53.379 --> 01:56.906
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

01:58.852 --> 01:59.841
Sorry, man.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.850
-Here's your scone.
-Thanks.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.520
Stupid British snack food!

02:09.262 --> 02:11.822
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.230
You know what might
help you deal with it?

02:16.503 --> 02:19.836
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.940
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.278
Nobody's mad about that.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.208
Exactly!
Because it's in the past.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.216
Anybody going to eat that?

02:39.459 --> 02:43.259
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

02:43.463 --> 02:46.296
We had a lot of liquor
left over from Christmas.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.899
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a real couple. We don't have to hide.

02:52.138 --> 02:53.969
I know. I can do this.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.700
And I can do this.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.241
We can't do that.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.976
Hey, Bing!

03:04.417 --> 03:07.909
Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

03:09.289 --> 03:11.757
I asked myself
that very question, sir.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.914
My boss, Doug.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.753
-This is Monica.
-Hi.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.589
-This is my wife, Kara.
-Nice to meet you.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.400
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

03:23.603 --> 03:25.537
Dickem, Stickem & Run.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.407
Let's go drink our body weight.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.345
What was that?

03:35.582 --> 03:36.674
That noise you made?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.145
Oh, my work laugh.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.874
Your work laugh?

03:40.086 --> 03:44.022
If you're going to survive this party,
come up with one too.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.047
All right. Check me out.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.424
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town."

03:57.937 --> 04:00.531
Everybody at work loved you last night.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.942
And they like me more
just because I was with you.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.111
You repaired the damage
from when they met Joey.

04:08.948 --> 04:12.509
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.

04:12.719 --> 04:15.051
Except for that time
at that strip club.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.084
Strip church.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.025
-I'll go find a racket.
-I thought you had one.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.360
I used to, but then Joey thought
it'd be fun to go hit rocks...

04:28.601 --> 04:30.193
...at bigger rocks.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.367
Do you have a tennis racket?

04:33.606 --> 04:36.370
I lent it to Joey, and
I've never gotten it back.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.637
Good luck with that.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.408
What's up?

04:44.651 --> 04:47.211
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.820
I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

04:50.089 --> 04:52.649
...and spend some time
with my friend Monica.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.420
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.960
How are you?

04:58.264 --> 04:59.822
What is new with you?

05:03.336 --> 05:05.600
Not much. Work's good.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.968
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.502
You know what?

05:14.414 --> 05:15.938
Let's talk about relationships.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.480
What's going on?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.149
Nothing.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.108
You go.

05:22.588 --> 05:25.955
There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.649
But I don't anymore.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.586
That's juicy.

05:31.864 --> 05:35.129
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.702
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

05:39.038 --> 05:42.496
I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

05:42.709 --> 05:43.937
No!

05:48.448 --> 05:50.507
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.789
Then what happened?

06:06.165 --> 06:07.860
You'll get your turn.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.834
-Hey, Phoebe. What's going on?
-Nothing.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.466
This is not over.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.630
No, no, no!

06:15.875 --> 06:19.311
I was up all night writing
this nasty letter to Emily.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.379
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in....

06:22.582 --> 06:24.243
Actually, thanks!

06:25.184 --> 06:27.550
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?

06:28.087 --> 06:29.850
Actually, I think I'll skip it.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.216
Really?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.588
I'll read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.391
Sure you don't want to?

06:36.662 --> 06:40.689
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.867
That's okay, Joe.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.695
Let's go, Phoebe.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.884
Game!

07:04.690 --> 07:08.251
I got to tell you, that partner
of yours is a real tiger.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.221
Are you all right?

07:13.466 --> 07:15.900
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.435
Am I on fire today or what?

07:20.706 --> 07:24.767
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.408
Okay, easy, Martina.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.708
I think we should let them
win the next game.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.886
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.280
Let them win one.

07:37.490 --> 07:41.654
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

07:41.994 --> 07:44.963
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.759
You're not giving them a chance.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.457
They have rackets.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.769
We'll make this the last game.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.975
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.234
Are you sure you never played pro?

07:59.846 --> 08:01.006
Please let them win.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.977
I'll take it down to 95%,
but that's the best I can do.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.684
-Missed it!
-I got it!

08:16.529 --> 08:17.518
Nice shot.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.529
I got it!

08:29.609 --> 08:31.167
Long!

08:37.617 --> 08:39.847
I can't believe you let them win.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.953
Well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

08:43.623 --> 08:44.715
I was frustrated.

08:44.924 --> 08:45.913
It's my racket.

08:46.158 --> 08:47.318
Frustrated with you!

08:47.627 --> 08:52.155
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.423
What bothers me...

08:53.633 --> 08:56.067
...is how different
you act around them.

08:56.335 --> 08:59.202
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

08:59.405 --> 09:02.966
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

09:04.810 --> 09:07.779
Listen, I don't sound
like some crazed, drunken pirate.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.539
I know you don't,
but "work Chandler" does.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.447
I don't like work Chandler.
The guy's a suck-up.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.121
Because you said that...

09:17.323 --> 09:19.188
...I'm not putting out tonight!

09:26.499 --> 09:29.627
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.996
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.971
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.405
That's right. He almost could.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.146
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.877
Oh, my God!

09:46.586 --> 09:48.247
Where the hell have you been?

09:49.155 --> 09:51.350
Just, you know, out.

09:51.557 --> 09:56.085
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.826
What were you doing?

09:58.030 --> 10:00.863
I went to a bar, and then...

10:01.067 --> 10:04.434
...I just walked around for a while.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.900
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

10:09.675 --> 10:10.903
He hooked up!

10:12.878 --> 10:14.209
He hooked up.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.610
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.181
I can do what I want.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.682
He hooked up!

10:22.888 --> 10:24.879
Tell us about her!

10:25.691 --> 10:27.124
Ross, you left your scarf

10:35.101 --> 10:36.966
Hey, you guys.

10:42.575 --> 10:46.511
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.510
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.810
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

10:55.855 --> 11:00.155
So I'm asking you, please,
just take a moment before you judge me.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.724
Nobody's judging you.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.693
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

11:09.835 --> 11:11.200
...call me.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.406
So I guess you finished your book.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.484
Had some time on our hands, did we?

11:27.219 --> 11:29.710
I know what you guys are going to say.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.550
You two would have
very hairy children.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.158
I didn't know you'd say that.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.163
Ross! Janice?

11:39.398 --> 11:41.298
All right. Hold on, hold on.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.330
This is Ross.

11:43.502 --> 11:46.665
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.930
He obviously lost his mind.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.707
Look, it's not that crazy. Okay?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.815
But it's Janice! I mean, she's...

11:57.983 --> 11:59.883
...Janice!

12:00.386 --> 12:02.411
How drunk were you?

12:02.588 --> 12:04.749
Janice and I have a lot in common.

12:04.924 --> 12:09.054
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.195
Are you going to see her again?

12:11.363 --> 12:14.196
-Don't put ideas in his head!
-I will see her.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.425
Damn it, Phoebe!

12:20.740 --> 12:23.800
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

12:24.043 --> 12:28.241
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew you liked him.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.711
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.812
My turn? What are you talking about?

12:38.257 --> 12:40.225
I know about you and Chandler.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.995
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

12:45.231 --> 12:49.429
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

12:49.668 --> 12:52.603
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

12:52.872 --> 12:54.737
And you said:

12:54.940 --> 12:58.933
"You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

13:04.617 --> 13:07.552
You're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.118
Let me know how it turns out.

13:12.558 --> 13:16.892
I wouldn't know, because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.528
Well, if you had kept listening...

13:19.765 --> 13:23.360
...you would have heard me
call him Mister...

13:23.536 --> 13:24.525
...Bigot.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.433
Mr. Bigot.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.477
He tells the most racist jokes.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.974
All right. So that's it.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.877
There's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

13:40.219 --> 13:42.414
Me and Chandler?

13:46.992 --> 13:48.425
Put your $20 down.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.596
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?

13:52.131 --> 13:56.158
All right, let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.793
And they're off!

14:00.506 --> 14:02.667
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

14:02.942 --> 14:04.842
Judge rules, no violation.

14:10.015 --> 14:14.281
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.784
-What?
-Are you serious?

14:17.089 --> 14:20.957
I opened up to her about all
the stuff that's been happening to me.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.025
I mean, I talked for hours.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.422
It is amazing...

14:24.630 --> 14:28.157
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.332
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.334
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

14:34.773 --> 14:37.503
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

14:37.776 --> 14:39.004
Judge rules...

14:39.311 --> 14:40.801
...Nutter Butter.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.980
Tough call.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.956
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should support President Clinton...

14:52.524 --> 14:54.355
...and her husband, Bill.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.891
How do you like your coffee?

14:59.164 --> 15:01.064
-None for me.
-A little sugar.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.861
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.342
-That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
-You get used to it.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.977
I don't think that I can.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.681
This will be it for me
on the work things.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.316
I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

15:19.518 --> 15:22.043
I'd rather not be with
this work-weasel guy...

15:22.321 --> 15:25.484
...when I can be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

15:29.895 --> 15:34.355
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.

15:34.566 --> 15:37.364
It's not strong enough
to defend itself.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.838
Hear what I said?

15:43.842 --> 15:45.036
What?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.311
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?

15:48.514 --> 15:51.574
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.842
Excuse me?

15:54.353 --> 15:56.344
-Well, I just
-Honey?

15:56.722 --> 15:59.020
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.014
Really?

16:01.260 --> 16:05.128
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.867
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.

16:09.134 --> 16:13.127
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.438
-You get it now, honey?
-I think I do!

16:22.448 --> 16:25.645
-Thank you, Monica.
-I thought you could use the help.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.945
Coffee in a fight!

16:34.326 --> 16:36.886
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

16:38.864 --> 16:41.355
Sure. Why?

16:41.667 --> 16:45.728
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

16:46.772 --> 16:50.333
She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.305
She keeps lying to me.

16:52.511 --> 16:56.572
That's it! I'm going over there
and confronting them right now.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.014
Panty raid.

17:12.064 --> 17:16.125
All right, so you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

17:17.236 --> 17:19.204
I'm just not very good at this.

17:19.405 --> 17:22.238
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

17:22.474 --> 17:25.204
-But we're not ready to tell yet.
-I know.

17:25.411 --> 17:30.110
Ever since high school, Rachel was the
one person that I told everything to.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.407
I miss that so much now.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.711
She's my best friend.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.620
Oh, my God, Rachel!

17:49.134 --> 17:51.068
What are you doing here?

17:52.504 --> 17:56.634
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

17:56.909 --> 17:59.400
...to look at my books.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.646
You know, see them a little better.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.408
Okay, great.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.985
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.483
...I was cleaning it.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.683
He pays me to clean it.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.093
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

18:20.466 --> 18:23.697
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work...

18:23.969 --> 18:25.630
...I'm at my new work.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.603
Good enough. Right?

18:32.344 --> 18:34.005
I'll go look at my books.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.540
Go get back to my new job.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.022
Congratulations on your new job!

18:54.032 --> 18:56.227
Man, she is really gullible.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.535
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.301
-Actually, I should get going.
-You're sure?

19:07.546 --> 19:09.673
I can stay out as late as you want.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.076
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work

19:12.317 --> 19:14.808
Yes, yes. You did.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.751
-Oh, man!
-What is wrong now?

19:18.757 --> 19:20.850
This isn't what I ordered.

19:21.059 --> 19:25.223
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

19:25.831 --> 19:28.994
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then

19:29.201 --> 19:30.259
I know!

19:30.502 --> 19:33.096
You lose your apartment,
you lose your job...

19:33.372 --> 19:37.331
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

19:40.345 --> 19:42.108
We need to talk.

19:43.048 --> 19:46.415
-Sometimes I feel
-No, no, don't.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.619
I'm going to talk.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.920
I believe...

19:51.190 --> 19:54.023
...that the sun has set...

19:54.226 --> 19:57.423
...on our day in the sun.

20:00.098 --> 20:03.397
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.435
Unfortunately...

20:07.739 --> 20:11.766
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

20:14.780 --> 20:18.216
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.810
You're ending this with me because...

20:23.088 --> 20:24.578
...I'm too whiny?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.789
So you're saying...

20:30.062 --> 20:33.225
...I've become so whiny...

20:33.498 --> 20:35.125
...that l...

20:35.400 --> 20:37.994
...annoy you...

20:39.238 --> 20:40.899
...Janice.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.435
Well, yeah!

20:42.741 --> 20:45.232
Oh, my God!

20:48.146 --> 20:49.238
Will you be okay?

20:49.448 --> 20:51.143
I am now.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.320
I guess that's two out of three...

21:06.465 --> 21:07.625
...Joey!

21:17.342 --> 21:19.367
Dude, we got to talk.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.378
I wanted to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.517
I hope this isn't too weird, but...

21:29.021 --> 21:31.615
...I had a thing with Janice.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.928
You're not mad?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.324
Why would I be mad?

21:39.531 --> 21:42.728
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.665
You don't fool around with
your friends' ex-girlfriends...

21:48.206 --> 21:51.300
...or possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.238
I am mad.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.486
But you know,
I'm going to forgive you.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.712
Because that's what friends do.

22:04.923 --> 22:09.189
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

22:09.428 --> 22:10.690
Thank you.

22:10.929 --> 22:12.590
But I want you to remember...

22:12.831 --> 22:15.197
...that I forgave you.

22:17.402 --> 22:21.668
I also want you to remember
that I let you live here rent-free.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.368
All right.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.200
And I want you to remember
that I gave you...

22:27.412 --> 22:29.243
...twenty-seven dollars.

22:30.682 --> 22:31.876
No strings attached!

22:32.084 --> 22:33.449
If you can't remember that...

22:33.685 --> 22:36.347
...we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
