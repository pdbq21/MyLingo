WEBVTT

00:04.437 --> 00:09.739
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.776
I had a great time on our honeymoon.

00:12.979 --> 00:16.540
I can't wait
to spend our life together.

00:16.783 --> 00:19.980
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

00:20.820 --> 00:22.913
You're back!

00:24.457 --> 00:27.255
Come on in!

00:30.130 --> 00:31.927
How was the honeymoon?

00:32.132 --> 00:36.501
So much fun. The best part is,
we met this great couple.

00:36.703 --> 00:41.265
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.701
They're cool.
It was their honeymoon too.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.946
They live here in the city.

00:47.147 --> 00:50.378
Can we go call them?
Is it too soon to call?

00:50.617 --> 00:54.713
We're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.184
Oh, were you looking for that?

00:58.158 --> 00:59.819
Well, yeah.

00:59.993 --> 01:04.896
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

01:05.365 --> 01:08.528
It's different.
Greg and Jenny are married.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.364
Greg and Jenny?
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."

01:12.572 --> 01:16.736
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

01:17.744 --> 01:20.770
-They're great. If you just..
-You know what?

01:21.014 --> 01:24.415
Give us our souvenirs
and get out of here.

01:25.718 --> 01:29.245
-We didn't get a chance to..
-You're kidding!

01:29.889 --> 01:33.655
-We didn't get anything for anyone.
-Nice necklace.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.857
That you can have.

02:17.403 --> 02:20.736
-Welcome home.
-How was the honeymoon?

02:20.940 --> 02:23.966
Great! How about you?
You're having a baby!

02:24.177 --> 02:26.304
Yeah, we are. It's so exciting.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.210
I always knew you two
would have a child out of wedlock.

02:32.152 --> 02:36.213
-Look, I have a sonogram picture.
-Good.

02:37.257 --> 02:40.920
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

02:42.662 --> 02:48.066
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?
When? How many times?

02:48.268 --> 02:52.170
Monica, that's not right.
Start with where.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.374
It happened about six weeks ago.

02:58.611 --> 03:03.913
I got home and Ross was there.
He'd been hanging out with Joey.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.915
You're welcome, buddy.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.124
Yeah, thanks.

03:13.826 --> 03:17.728
I had a lot of work,
and Ross offered to help.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.627
We had wine, we got to talking.

03:20.833 --> 03:24.792
Next thing you know,
Ross comes on to me.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.767
That's a little misleading.

03:29.008 --> 03:32.205
-What is?
-The lie you just told.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.107
-That you came on to me?
-There's the one!

03:37.317 --> 03:41.083
-But you did. Let's be honest.
-Yes, let's.

03:41.821 --> 03:45.621
Ross. If it helps, I don't believe you.

03:47.627 --> 03:49.618
It's not important.

03:49.829 --> 03:54.789
What's important is, we're having
a baby, not who came on to who.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.128
"Whom."

03:59.639 --> 04:01.903
That's right.

04:03.142 --> 04:06.737
-You kissed me first.
-You were begging for it!

04:07.013 --> 04:09.413
You were sending me signals!

04:09.682 --> 04:15.245
I was sending signals? Anyone think
that I'd send Ross begging signals?

04:15.488 --> 04:17.979
Please, show of hands.

04:20.159 --> 04:24.493
It doesn't matter what people believe!
It happened.

04:24.731 --> 04:30.067
Maybe I need to be more careful.
Am I sending these signals now?

04:30.336 --> 04:34.864
-You know what? Just drop it.
-Show me how I begged you.

04:35.141 --> 04:38.770
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.017
It's an expression.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.092
Come on, Rachel, open up.
Let me explain.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.597
-Still won't let you in, huh?
-No.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.794
I'm just gonna close this door
so we can talk about you.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.804
I can't believe
he taped them having sex.

05:11.978 --> 05:16.108
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.349
Such a rookie mistake.

05:19.552 --> 05:23.283
-Know who has a great camera?
-Greg and Jenny?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.515
-I want to call them.
-Let's call.

05:26.726 --> 05:30.025
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.034
Hello. 8th Street Deli?

05:38.237 --> 05:42.298
Hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.636
-Sorry, wrong number.
-Here you go, babe.

05:48.147 --> 05:51.173
Hello?
It's the deli again!

05:51.384 --> 05:54.251
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.479
I don't think this number's right.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.160
-What?
-You got fake-numbered.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.364
-What? People don't do that.
-Oh, I think we do.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.696
-Why would they do that?
-I don't know.

06:12.972 --> 06:17.068
You were a delight.
You asked those great questions.

06:17.343 --> 06:22.246
And you were never funnier.
Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

06:22.482 --> 06:25.042
You still got me and Phoebe.

06:25.251 --> 06:29.210
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.348
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.551
I wonder why, pervert.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.223
Okay, I am not a pervert.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.731
That's, like, the pervert motto.

06:42.935 --> 06:48.567
You raise your hand, put your left
hand down your pants and repeat that.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.767
Filming Rachel was not planned.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.242
Here's what happened.
Joey can back me up.

06:55.448 --> 07:00.442
A month and a half ago, remember
I came to you with a problem?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.782
The personal thing?

07:05.091 --> 07:09.050
-What personal thing?
-About sex?

07:10.630 --> 07:14.031
That I hadn't had sex in months?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.168
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

07:26.746 --> 07:31.683
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.613
Sure.

07:34.353 --> 07:38.551
How about you showering
with your mom?

07:40.126 --> 07:44.062
I actually had a topic in mind.

07:46.499 --> 07:51.937
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.936
-For, like, months?
-Five, to be..

07:55.174 --> 07:57.142
lying. Six.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.840
Six months? That's rough.

08:00.079 --> 08:05.483
It's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the small things, like..

08:05.685 --> 08:10.281
the sound of a bird
and the color of the sky.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.290
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.096
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

08:19.298 --> 08:22.529
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

08:23.469 --> 08:27.599
I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

08:27.807 --> 08:31.607
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it is putty.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.369
Tell it to me.

08:33.613 --> 08:38.516
Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.652
Remember, it is just the story.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.522
I'll try to control myself.

08:48.928 --> 08:53.024
Years ago, I was backpacking
across Western Europe..

08:53.232 --> 08:58.670
-You were backpacking across Europe?
-Have a nice six more months.

08:58.871 --> 09:04.332
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and..?

09:06.078 --> 09:11.516
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.343
-Nice.
-Thanks.

09:16.188 --> 09:20.750
I was at the end of this path,
and there was a lake.

09:20.993 --> 09:25.020
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.893
It was dead silent.
Gorgeous.

09:29.135 --> 09:35.040
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.209
But she was crying.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.436
Why?

09:48.521 --> 09:50.614
This is great wine.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.154
It's from France.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.157
In Europe.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.955
Western Europe.

10:02.468 --> 10:07.838
A few years ago I was backpacking
across Western Europe.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.840
-Really?
-Wait, it gets better.

10:14.013 --> 10:16.504
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.

10:16.716 --> 10:20.584
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.657
-You did?
-Yeah. When were you there?

10:25.925 --> 10:27.119
-Eighty..
-Nine?

10:27.293 --> 10:28.624
Three.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.125
I was 13?

10:34.800 --> 10:38.759
-So anyway, I was hiking..
-I love hiking!

10:38.938 --> 10:40.929
That's great!

10:42.775 --> 10:47.303
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo..

10:47.546 --> 10:51.710
-I think it's "Tibidabo."
-Do you want to tell the story?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.585
How'd your date go?

10:57.790 --> 11:01.783
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

11:02.461 --> 11:07.330
-Your story sucks.
-Then you didn't tell it right.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.932
-Show me how you did it.
-No, I don't want to.

11:11.137 --> 11:16.473
-How long since you seen a girl naked?
-I was backpacking..

11:16.709 --> 11:21.942
-I'm not feeling it.
-I was outside Barcelona, hiking..

11:22.148 --> 11:27.814
-Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
-It's been six months. I'm always hot.

11:28.020 --> 11:32.081
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.293
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.894
Do what I do before an audition.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.793
I'm not hungry.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.594
No.

11:42.768 --> 11:48.263
Use my camera to record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.033
I'll try that.

11:50.242 --> 11:56.545
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.
Just hit record. Good luck.

11:56.816 --> 12:03.187
If you ever have any problem with the
ladies, you know I'll help you out.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.454
That means a lot to me, man.

12:29.048 --> 12:34.486
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

12:36.088 --> 12:39.615
Ross, thank God you're here.
You have to help me.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.623
Were you talking to yourself?

12:42.895 --> 12:46.592
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

12:46.866 --> 12:50.802
When she came in,
I totally forgot about the camera.

12:51.003 --> 12:54.666
It kept rolling
and recorded everything.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.573
Yeah, we're gonna need
to see that tape.

13:00.412 --> 13:04.280
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.018
Come on, it'll be like watching
the Discovery Channel..

13:08.187 --> 13:10.087
only we'll know the monkeys.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.616
Look, I'm not gonna let you guys
watch us.

13:13.793 --> 13:18.526
-I haven't even seen it yet.
-I'll trade you two tapes of me having sex.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.565
Thanks, I'm good.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.759
We don't wanna see the dirty stuff..

13:23.936 --> 13:27.895
-just the stuff leading up to it.
-No. Rachel's gonna kill me as it is.

13:28.073 --> 13:31.042
It's not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.468
Thank you.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.349
-No.
-You're right.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.887
-Joey, no.
-Loud and clear.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.556
I don't get why
they'd give us a fake number.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.836
If they knew what they were doing,
they didn't give you real names.

14:01.040 --> 14:06.239
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but not fake names.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.380
Hi. Ken Adams.
Nice to meet you.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.712
Regina Phalange.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.216
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-I know.

14:19.124 --> 14:22.685
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.363
You said they were funny.
Joke, joke, joke!

14:27.566 --> 14:30.262
Joke, joke..

14:35.140 --> 14:38.200
-It was your questions.
-What about them?

14:38.410 --> 14:43.541
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.820
-Was that another joke?
-Was that another question?

14:51.624 --> 14:52.989
Is Ross still here?

14:53.158 --> 14:57.060
Watch out, honey.
Someone else is asking questions now.

15:00.466 --> 15:04.994
No, but he told us what happened.
It was an honest mistake.

15:05.204 --> 15:10.039
How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

15:10.276 --> 15:12.506
Oh, forget it.

15:14.046 --> 15:19.348
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.619
It was an accident, okay?

15:22.788 --> 15:26.053
I feel bad.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

15:26.292 --> 15:29.022
Anyway, here.

15:29.295 --> 15:33.356
You might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.657
Thank you.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.969
What?

15:46.345 --> 15:50.042
-You don't want to see this, do you?
-Hell, yeah!

15:51.050 --> 15:53.575
I am not gonna show you this.

15:53.852 --> 15:57.811
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

15:58.023 --> 16:00.082
Forget it.

16:00.359 --> 16:06.161
We'll think of another way to put the
"who came on to who" thing to rest.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.333
Come on now, think!

16:10.102 --> 16:14.368
It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants.

16:14.573 --> 16:19.067
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

16:19.345 --> 16:23.111
-I want to see it.
-What?

16:23.349 --> 16:25.510
You don't want us to see this.

16:25.851 --> 16:32.086
You so badly don't want us to see it
that it makes me want to see it.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.195
Are we watching the tape or not?

16:37.896 --> 16:43.562
-It's for your sake.
-I don't believe you.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.398
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

16:48.707 --> 16:52.609
-Rachel, please?
-Oh, a little preview.

16:54.246 --> 16:59.513
Fine. I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

16:59.752 --> 17:05.213
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying..

17:10.896 --> 17:12.796
Okay, here we go.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.535
I'm so happy.

17:21.073 --> 17:24.873
Thank God you're here. Help me.
Were you talking to yourself?

17:25.044 --> 17:29.071
-There I am.
-You're gonna get pregnant.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.443
I screwed up so bad.

17:31.683 --> 17:36.950
I told Monica that I'd send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.612
You didn't do it?

17:38.857 --> 17:44.124
I put them in my desk at work,
and forgot about them until today.

17:47.199 --> 17:52.262
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it
to the wedding. I'm fine.

17:52.538 --> 17:56.975
-Kind of hurting my hand though.
-I know.

17:57.209 --> 18:02.613
I can 't believe it, especially after
Monica went on and on about it.

18:02.881 --> 18:07.250
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.

18:07.486 --> 18:12.253
Please, drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

18:21.467 --> 18:25.369
Did you do it on our invitations?

18:27.673 --> 18:30.972
Not on the ones we sent out.

18:31.610 --> 18:36.604
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

18:43.922 --> 18:47.449
It seems like yesterday
they just got engaged.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.524
I know.

18:49.962 --> 18:54.956
Remember the night they got engaged?
How you and I almost..

18:55.167 --> 18:58.967
Oh, I remember how we almost.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.402
You think we would've
gone through with it?

19:02.641 --> 19:05.405
You think we would have done it?

19:07.346 --> 19:11.715
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn 't sure if you did.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.783
Oh, I wanted to.

19:15.354 --> 19:19.791
So we both wanted to.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.926
Interesting.

19:25.631 --> 19:31.661
Anyway, it probably worked out
for the best.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.068
Yeah, sure.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.797
In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.

19:36.975 --> 19:40.604
In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.

19:44.383 --> 19:50.379
Did I ever tell you about the time
I backpacked through Western Europe?

19:57.262 --> 20:00.163
Get ready to see some begging.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.700
-Oh, you came on to Ross!
-What?

20:04.903 --> 20:07.497
Now I'm so happy.

20:08.407 --> 20:11.843
-What?
-You used the Europe story!

20:12.044 --> 20:16.708
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

20:17.616 --> 20:23.020
-How do you know about that story?
-How do you know about that story?

20:23.255 --> 20:26.622
My friend Irene heard it
from some guy.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.523
Some guy!

20:32.297 --> 20:36.734
No, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.363
Ken Adams!

20:50.148 --> 20:53.879
So, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

20:54.253 --> 20:59.919
About that, the "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

21:00.158 --> 21:03.127
It would have happened either way.

21:03.328 --> 21:08.425
If you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

21:09.234 --> 21:13.432
-It was an amazing night.
-It was. It was amazing.

21:15.974 --> 21:19.102
You think it looked amazing?

21:20.078 --> 21:24.913
I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.811
Yeah, me neither.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.282
Yet.

21:33.959 --> 21:38.555
-That may be weird.
-Yeah, it would be really weird.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.833
-Good luck.
-Good luck to you.

21:53.445 --> 21:57.142
-Mind if I mute?
-Oh, please.

21:57.716 --> 22:02.380
-There go the clothes.
-You are undressing awfully quickly.

22:02.621 --> 22:05.784
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

22:13.899 --> 22:18.393
-We look pretty good.
-I was gonna say.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.639
-Nice tan.
-Thank you.

22:21.873 --> 22:25.172
I'd just gone to
the beach that weekend.

22:27.913 --> 22:32.714
-Have you been working out?
-I have been working out.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.880
This is so much better
than I ever..

22:43.528 --> 22:46.520
Oh, that's not pretty.

22:47.999 --> 22:51.435
-Make it stop. Make it stop.
-Oh, no!

22:57.209 --> 23:00.872
Greg and Jenny's number
is totally different in here.

23:02.781 --> 23:05.579
-I don't ask too many questions, do I?
-No.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.082
-Really?
-Absolutely not.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.379
-Really?
-Oh, God.

23:11.723 --> 23:16.023
I bet that phone thing was some sort
of mix-up. I'm gonna call them.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.691
Hello, Greg?
This is Monica from the plane.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.769
Listen, the number that
you gave me, 8-5-3..

23:27.406 --> 23:30.398
Jenny's been giving out
their old number!

23:30.609 --> 23:34.340
Jenny! That is so Jenny!

23:34.613 --> 23:38.640
How would you like to
get together next Saturday?

23:38.850 --> 23:40.977
Okay, how about Sunday?

23:41.186 --> 23:43.654
Okay, the week after that?

23:43.922 --> 23:45.651
The week after that?

23:46.158 --> 23:52.097
You know what? We are interesting,
funny people with good questions.

23:52.330 --> 23:56.096
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that..

23:56.301 --> 23:57.996
January 15?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.830
We'll see you then!
