WEBVTT

00:03.903 --> 00:07.168
-Hey.
-Hey. So, what do you think?

00:08.174 --> 00:11.735
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?

00:11.945 --> 00:14.345
Boots? Boots!

00:15.715 --> 00:20.448
Now, they're a little more than I usually
spend on boots. Or rent.

00:21.454 --> 00:24.890
Did you say you bought "boots"
or "boats"?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.023
I know.

00:27.193 --> 00:32.688
-I'll miss being able to afford food.
-I'm sorry. They just looked so good.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.594
The saleswoman was like:

00:34.834 --> 00:38.600
-"These are too expensive for you."
-She had a point.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.365
-Hey.
-Hi. Oh, my God.

00:42.575 --> 00:48.104
-Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
-They're mine!

00:48.715 --> 00:54.676
-Too bad we're gonna have to return them.
-Return them? They're gonna hear you.

00:55.021 --> 00:58.980
I'm not returning them. I know they
cost a lot, but I'll wear them all the time.

00:59.192 --> 01:03.288
You'll see. Besides,
I love the compliments.

01:03.463 --> 01:06.330
Have you ever had something
so beautiful, everyone wants it?

01:06.533 --> 01:11.334
-I have you.
-Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

01:49.008 --> 01:51.943
That's right. I love you.

01:52.145 --> 01:56.309
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

01:56.516 --> 02:00.475
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

02:02.655 --> 02:06.751
-He's talking to the baby.
-Oh! Okay.

02:08.361 --> 02:11.956
Okay, because when he said,
"l can't wait for your first words"..

02:12.198 --> 02:14.462
I thought, "There's a trick."

02:16.269 --> 02:19.466
Well, I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.765
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

02:23.009 --> 02:28.345
Hey, listen. Can you do me a favor? My
sister knows you work at Ralph Lauren..

02:28.548 --> 02:32.006
Forget it. No way. I am not sending
more Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.379
-It is a waste.
-No, not her.

02:34.587 --> 02:38.182
My youngest sister, Dina,
is interested in fashion.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.690
She wants to talk to someone successful
to give her some advice.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.797
-I guess I could talk to my supervisors.
-No, she wants to talk to you.

02:45.999 --> 02:50.993
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

02:51.204 --> 02:54.662
-Okay, so would you meet with her?
-Yes, I'd love to. Have her come by.

02:54.874 --> 02:59.834
Great, thanks. You'll love her. She's the
smartest of all the Tribbiani children.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.536
-Yeah, you know the SATs?
-Yeah.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.375
She took them.

03:04.918 --> 03:09.184
-Doesn't Ben go to Smithfield Day School?
-Yeah. Why?

03:09.389 --> 03:12.688
-Sting has a son that goes there too.
-I know. He's in Ben's class.

03:13.459 --> 03:19.227
You knew and never said anything? With
all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?

03:19.432 --> 03:25.132
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

03:30.210 --> 03:33.111
"Sting's son, 7 years old."
And there's a picture.

03:33.346 --> 03:38.283
What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools"?

03:38.484 --> 03:41.885
It's New York Magazine. It's an article
about the city's best schools.

03:42.088 --> 03:46.149
-So how well do you know Sting?
-I actually haven't even met him.

03:46.392 --> 03:51.261
Yeah. That's too bad. I really wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.

03:51.431 --> 03:55.492
I know! Why don't you
meet him and get tickets.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.260
If you get two, I'll take you.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.962
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.

04:01.174 --> 04:05.907
There you go. You're so lucky.
You might get to meet Sting tomorrow.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.637
That's why you have kids.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.821
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

04:17.023 --> 04:20.481
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

04:21.661 --> 04:25.825
See, Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out
of them already. They're very practical.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.932
You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants..

04:29.135 --> 04:33.799
You wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn the money to pay for them.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.938
-Wow, they're beautiful.
-They hurt so much.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.339
-What?
-The guy who made these..

04:41.547 --> 04:44.675
hates feet
and wants to see them die.

04:44.917 --> 04:49.047
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.851
I can't. I told Chandler I'd wear them
all the time. I can't just give them away.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.359
-Then get your money back and return them.
-I can't do that either.

04:57.563 --> 05:02.694
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

05:04.671 --> 05:08.801
-Hey.
-Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.

05:09.075 --> 05:12.511
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.942
I dropped him off at Carol's.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.981
Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna
get those tickets, though.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.479
Oh, no. Why not?

05:19.686 --> 05:23.520
It turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.715
-How come?
-Apparently, Sting's son made fun..

05:26.959 --> 05:30.258
of the fact that Ben's moms
are "lesbenims."

05:31.064 --> 05:36.001
Wait. If they don't get along, smooth
things over. Make them be friends.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.296
-You can't force kids to be friends.
-Sure you can.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.168
Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.935
-Playpen? Ben's 7.
-Your kid is 7?

05:47.980 --> 05:50.039
He's really small.

05:51.584 --> 05:55.486
-Please get the tickets.
-I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

05:55.688 --> 05:59.488
-Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
-What?

06:04.897 --> 06:06.262
Look, I'm sorry..

06:11.471 --> 06:13.132
Phoebe?

06:24.150 --> 06:27.051
Here she is: future fashion superstar.

06:27.253 --> 06:31.212
-Oh, Joey, I'm hardly..
-My little sister Dina.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.517
-Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

06:33.726 --> 06:37.025
Thanks so much for meeting with me.
Joey's told me so much about you.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.493
This is so exciting for her.

06:38.664 --> 06:41.963
-Ralph Lauren smiled at her in the elevator.
-You sure it was at you?

06:42.135 --> 06:45.536
Because he likes it sometimes
when the buttons light up.

06:45.705 --> 06:51.200
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
get down to business.

06:51.644 --> 06:56.377
You, be good, learn a lot. And if she takes
you to the freebie room, I need shirts..

06:56.549 --> 07:01.486
but none with that creepy logo with
the guy riding the dog, holding the bone.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.115
Okay. All right, Dina.

07:04.323 --> 07:08.157
Well, let's talk about the different
areas of fashion..

07:08.361 --> 07:10.488
that you could get involved in.

07:10.696 --> 07:15.065
Let's see, there's design. But you may
need a whole other degree for that.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.261
-Sales is great. You get to travel.
-I don't care about fashion.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.967
I'm pregnant. And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.944
Then there's marketing.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.838
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I just was yawning.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.775
-Don't forget, my office party's tonight.
-That's tonight?

07:59.946 --> 08:04.246
I forgot all about the "secret Santa" gift.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.748
Do we like this?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.481
We don't really have to go to this thing,
do we?

08:09.655 --> 08:15.719
I know that you don't like my office parties,
but you can wear your new boots.

08:15.928 --> 08:19.591
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

08:20.933 --> 08:24.460
-I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
-Why not?

08:24.670 --> 08:28.970
I'm worried your bosses will see them
and think they pay you too much money.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.770
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

08:33.446 --> 08:37.007
Do you think I work some kind of
boot-pricing company?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.811
I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
and the boots don't go with it.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.980
You said those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

08:46.158 --> 08:49.594
What are you planning on wearing,
a chicken suit?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.957
Fine. If you want me to,
I'll wear the boots.

08:53.165 --> 08:57.534
In fact, I'll go into my room right now
and try the outfit on.

09:02.508 --> 09:05.033
Christmas party in my boots!

09:10.116 --> 09:13.108
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

09:13.286 --> 09:17.620
It's gonna be okay.
He has been incredibly supportive of me.

09:17.823 --> 09:22.123
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.558
-Thank you.
-Okay.

09:25.831 --> 09:29.392
Hey! It's my fashion girls.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.137
-What's wrong?
-Why don't you sit down.

09:34.307 --> 09:38.107
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.714
What's going on?
Is it Mom? Is she sick?

09:42.949 --> 09:44.814
Is it Dad's heart?

09:45.017 --> 09:47.451
Is that a sandwich?

09:49.522 --> 09:53.083
-Mom and Dad are fine.
-Is that a sandwich?!

09:54.594 --> 10:00.362
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

10:01.567 --> 10:05.003
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.432
Now. Give him the sandwich!

10:08.941 --> 10:12.172
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.473
Because you have to have sex
to get pregnant.

10:15.681 --> 10:19.014
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.120
What? Dina..

10:25.658 --> 10:31.619
I can't believe this. You're the good one.
You went to college! Both years!

10:34.433 --> 10:35.695
Who did this to you?

10:35.901 --> 10:40.270
Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
I like him a lot. He's real funny.

10:40.439 --> 10:46.935
You got pregnant for "funny"?
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

10:50.049 --> 10:53.018
-I'll be back. Stay here!
-Why? Where you going?

10:53.219 --> 10:56.586
I can't look at you right now.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.020
I know.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.307
Oh, there you are, Ben.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.270
You're Ben, right?

11:20.846 --> 11:23.007
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.707
I heard you're having a problem
with one of the boys.

11:25.885 --> 11:31.414
So I thought I'd come and sit you both down,
have a little talk and make it all okay.

11:31.657 --> 11:35.718
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.160
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

11:39.365 --> 11:43.426
Sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside..

11:43.669 --> 11:46.263
but they have famous fathers.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.866
I have to go. My friend Doug
is waiting for me over there.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.636
Wow, your friend Doug
looks a lot like Billy Joel.

11:52.812 --> 11:57.112
-Is that who his father is?
-No. His dad's a dentist.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.807
Him, you're friends with.

12:04.890 --> 12:11.022
-Excuse me, can I help you with something?
-Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.993
-Are you with one of the students?
-I'm with Ben.

12:14.266 --> 12:19.397
-Are you one of Ben's mothers?
-I am one of Ben's mothers.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.937
I'm a lesbian.

12:22.174 --> 12:25.974
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

12:26.178 --> 12:30.171
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm a new teacher here.

12:30.416 --> 12:35.217
-I've only met your partner, Carol.
-That would make me Susan.

12:35.454 --> 12:41.415
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
to discuss his problems with Ben?

12:41.627 --> 12:45.324
I think the parents should sit down together
and have a conversation.

12:45.531 --> 12:48.432
Yeah, let's do that!

12:49.201 --> 12:50.566
That sounds good.

12:50.803 --> 12:55.467
We should sit down and talk.
Me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.

12:55.674 --> 13:01.010
-How will I get in touch with them?
-Their number's on the contact sheet.

13:01.213 --> 13:06.150
Could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

13:06.352 --> 13:11.483
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.866
-You know, that party wasn't bad.
-Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.092
That was a fun surprise.

13:24.336 --> 13:28.170
-I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk.
-No, we can't walk.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.241
No. Hey, there's a cab.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.441
That's a police car.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.513
Maybe we could commit a crime,
have them pick us up.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.951
-It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on.
-Okay.

13:40.152 --> 13:45.385
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole?

13:45.624 --> 13:48.752
-What's going on?
-I can't walk, okay?

13:48.928 --> 13:51.954
-These boots were a huge mistake.
-What?

13:52.198 --> 13:57.261
You were right. I never should have bought
them. They're killing me, one toe at a time.

13:57.703 --> 14:01.537
-So they're really tight, huh?
-I just said you were right, sweetie.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.335
Isn't it clear I'm delirious from the pain?

14:04.510 --> 14:08.640
So I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.613
It's oddly unsettling.

14:12.818 --> 14:15.378
How are we gonna we get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

14:15.554 --> 14:18.614
I don't think me getting on your back
is gonna improve matters.

14:18.791 --> 14:22.454
Wow, being right sure doesn't help
with the funny.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.255
-Hop on.
-Okay, wait.

14:24.463 --> 14:27.432
Let me just get my boots off first.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.929
Oh, God.

14:39.411 --> 14:44.110
I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a little turned-on.

14:48.254 --> 14:53.214
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will just slip out?

14:55.294 --> 14:58.457
What college was that, Dina?

14:59.932 --> 15:02.127
Oh, my God. Bobby?

15:02.334 --> 15:06.168
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

15:06.405 --> 15:10.535
-Joey, what are you doing?
-Just what needs to be done.

15:11.143 --> 15:15.477
-Dearly beloved, we're gathered here..
-This is crazy.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.946
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

15:19.151 --> 15:22.746
-Where were we? Do you take this man..?
-No!

15:22.955 --> 15:24.946
-You'll take him.
-No, I won't!

15:25.157 --> 15:27.057
-You don't get a say.
-Yes, I do.

15:27.259 --> 15:32.629
-I heard "l do." We're halfway there. You.
-All right, Joey, that is enough!

15:32.831 --> 15:36.267
As beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.

15:36.468 --> 15:42.873
They don't have a marriage license or
witnesses, and the groom only has one shoe.

15:43.108 --> 15:47.135
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.608
What am I supposed to do?

15:48.814 --> 15:52.807
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and that can make their own decisions.

15:53.018 --> 15:57.455
No, they can't. They were
stupid enough to get knocked up!

15:58.857 --> 16:02.384
Contraceptives are not
always effective. Right?

16:02.962 --> 16:09.333
-Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
-Come on, kids, a little help here!

16:13.605 --> 16:17.097
Wow! This place is incredible!

16:19.311 --> 16:21.643
Sting's pen..

16:21.847 --> 16:24.975
that he gave to Phoebe.

16:29.321 --> 16:33.314
Come on, secret passageway.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.255
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:37.529 --> 16:40.362
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

16:40.566 --> 16:44.866
-Why else would I be here?
-Why don't you sit down.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.597
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting along lately.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.867
I'm sure there are two sides to this story.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.739
But all I've heard is that
Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."

16:54.947 --> 16:59.281
-I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
-No.

17:00.319 --> 17:04.221
I see. You see, I think it would be better
for the children..

17:04.390 --> 17:10.124
if all the parents were here. Except for,
you know, Ben's birth mother and father.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.753
Well, I'm sorry.
Jack's father's not available.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.996
Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

17:19.171 --> 17:21.799
No, I know that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.

17:22.007 --> 17:27.877
Concert. Yeah.
That does put us in quite a pickle.

17:28.113 --> 17:32.914
I'm busy before and after the concert,
and he's obviously busy during.

17:33.152 --> 17:37.145
So I guess you and I should talk
about Jack and Ben right now.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.847
Unless.. Unless..

17:40.059 --> 17:44.018
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert..

17:44.229 --> 17:47.323
all the while thinking
about the children.

17:47.533 --> 17:52.129
-Are you here for tickets?
-Thank you. Four would be great.

17:52.337 --> 17:57.673
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

17:57.876 --> 18:01.175
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.440
Look, I've just pressed a button
triggering a silent alarm.

18:04.683 --> 18:09.086
-Any minute now, the police will be here.
-The Police? Here?

18:09.288 --> 18:11.449
A reunion?

18:18.430 --> 18:22.764
Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.

18:23.035 --> 18:28.166
-Oh, wait! Stop, stop!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

18:29.108 --> 18:32.236
My boots in tan! Can you get a little closer
so I see the price?

18:32.444 --> 18:36.938
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

18:37.182 --> 18:42.119
I'm sorry. I can walk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

18:42.888 --> 18:46.324
-I don't have your boots.
-I don't have them either. Where are they?

18:46.558 --> 18:51.723
Why don't you check in one of my
saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay?

18:52.464 --> 18:56.298
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

18:56.568 --> 18:58.502
Are you ever gonna wear the boots again?

18:58.670 --> 19:03.073
Yes, I am. Okay? They're very practical.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.142
-I could wear them with pants or skirts..
-Honey. Honey.

19:07.946 --> 19:14.181
Okay, I'll never wear them again. I just
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.117
You know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

19:17.356 --> 19:22.055
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.558
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

19:28.534 --> 19:33.403
Just because they're not getting
married doesn't mean it's a disaster.

19:33.605 --> 19:38.542
-Maybe they have a plan.
-Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.508
Now, what's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.011
Well..

19:43.615 --> 19:46.846
I really have high hopes for my band.

19:47.986 --> 19:52.116
-You were right. He is funny.
-Now, wait a minute.

19:52.291 --> 19:56.421
I bet when you told people you wanted
to be an actor, they laughed at you.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.153
Come on, Bobby,
tell us a little bit about your band.

19:59.398 --> 20:05.098
Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.235
Really?

20:10.876 --> 20:14.141
If you're having a baby,
you should be married.

20:14.379 --> 20:19.476
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

20:19.751 --> 20:23.346
-I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
-So, what are you gonna do?

20:23.522 --> 20:27.481
Have the baby and raise it by yourself?
Without a husband?

20:27.693 --> 20:31.459
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!

20:31.663 --> 20:36.498
-Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
-No, it's different for you.

20:36.668 --> 20:40.604
You're so strong. You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

20:40.806 --> 20:45.539
-Excuse me?
-One pregnant woman at a time, please!

20:46.912 --> 20:49.312
I just want you to be okay.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.041
So forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

20:52.284 --> 20:54.343
Maybe.

20:55.921 --> 21:00.290
Yeah. So, what kind of music
does Numbnuts..?

21:00.525 --> 21:02.925
Oh, forget it! I can't!

21:03.128 --> 21:08.930
I am scared to death about this. But I
think I can do it. I just need some help.

21:09.134 --> 21:12.968
-Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
-You bet I am.

21:13.171 --> 21:18.165
And to answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.678
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier
you've made all this on her.

21:25.884 --> 21:31.754
-Why can't you do that for me?
-Because you're my baby sister!

21:31.990 --> 21:36.950
And you're my big brother. You're
my favorite guy in the whole world.

21:37.162 --> 21:42.691
I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.
I was scared of telling you.

21:43.402 --> 21:46.337
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

21:46.538 --> 21:51.237
I can't stand the thought of having
this baby with you mad at me.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.172
I want him to have his uncle.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.915
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

21:59.051 --> 22:02.919
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

22:03.789 --> 22:09.694
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby will be so loved.

22:09.895 --> 22:13.228
-And not just by us.
-That's right.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.058
By his uncle too.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.996
And by you.

22:21.940 --> 22:27.139
Bobby, why don't we come over here and
let them have a little moment, okay?

22:31.049 --> 22:33.381
Come here.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.320
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

22:45.030 --> 22:46.463
Guess what.

22:50.602 --> 22:54.038
We're good. We're good.
We know each other.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.768
So..

22:56.942 --> 23:00.708
-anyway, guess what.
-Oh, there's more?

23:00.879 --> 23:04.815
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

23:04.983 --> 23:08.680
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.683
Well, let's just say:

23:15.761 --> 23:18.127
-Where are the seats?
-Middle balcony.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.696
Would you say that's
more than 50 yards away..

23:20.932 --> 23:24.595
from Sting, his wife
or a member of his family?

23:24.803 --> 23:28.170
-Yeah.
-Then that's not breaking the law. I'm there!
