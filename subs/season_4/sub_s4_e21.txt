WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:06.400
All of a sudden,
so much is happening.

00:06.773 --> 00:09.105
I know.
Ross is getting married.

00:09.376 --> 00:12.106
Phoebe's making people.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.214
-Everybody's doing stuff.
-We just sit here.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.781
If I died,
people would know I was here...

00:18.051 --> 00:20.611
...only by the ass print
on this chair!

00:22.355 --> 00:26.086
-What are we doing?
-Wasting our lives.

00:26.726 --> 00:28.318
I meant for lunch.

00:30.397 --> 00:33.161
We have to do something.
Something huge!

00:34.334 --> 00:36.097
We could climb Mt. Everest.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.895
Not something stupid.
Something huge!

00:40.106 --> 00:42.233
I saw an ad for this video.

00:42.475 --> 00:45.137
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that!

00:45.945 --> 00:49.176
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.214
-It's just steep!
-Yeah.

00:52.752 --> 00:56.347
We're going! It'd be nice
to leave an ass print on Everest.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.614
What's up?

00:59.826 --> 01:02.624
-We're gonna climb Mt. Everest.
-Yeah, baby!

01:02.929 --> 01:04.556
I looked into that.

01:04.798 --> 01:09.292
Yeah, but it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.234
And you would die.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.766
We could get that Everest video.

01:18.478 --> 01:21.572
We could do that
without risking our lives at all.

01:22.482 --> 01:25.576
While we're at the video store,
we could rent Die Hard!

01:28.154 --> 01:29.519
I just remembered.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.283
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.854
So you'll stay here
and hang out with me?

01:39.699 --> 01:41.667
But one of these days...

01:41.935 --> 01:45.200
...we'll get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again!

01:47.540 --> 01:49.531
The One with the lnvitation

02:36.856 --> 02:41.725
That was fast. It usually takes me
hours to get Ben to go down for his nap.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.830
He's such a sweetheart.
Do you know what he said?

02:44.998 --> 02:49.196
-Good night, mommy.
-That's because he has lots of mommies.

02:50.503 --> 02:54.303
Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become
his word for "woman".

02:56.042 --> 02:59.443
So does your uncle Nathan
get an invite or not?

02:59.646 --> 03:01.637
Oh, God!
Nobody likes him.

03:01.915 --> 03:05.976
He's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.346
Invite him!

03:09.289 --> 03:11.189
Did I do these neat enough?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.356
Yeah, they're fine.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.193
We'll say that Ben addressed them.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.657
You invited Rachel then?

03:21.434 --> 03:22.492
Sure, why not?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.166
Really?

03:25.205 --> 03:29.141
I wouldn't be comfortable having
any of my old lovers there.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.436
Do you think
we shouldn't invite her?

03:32.679 --> 03:35.409
You know I absolutely adore Rachel.

03:35.648 --> 03:39.448
It's just that I thought
it might be awkward for you.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.183
But it's absolutely your decision.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.021
-More tea?
-Sure.

03:45.525 --> 03:46.514
Earl Grey?

03:47.927 --> 03:49.758
Fine, invite whoever you want.

03:54.867 --> 03:59.998
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.341
And I just want a million dollars!

04:10.049 --> 04:13.041
Oh God, Monica. Thank God!

04:15.255 --> 04:18.554
This is Rachel.
Another Lincoln High survivor.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.055
This is Chandler.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.420
Phoebe.

04:21.694 --> 04:22.752
Joey.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.758
-Do you remember Ross?
-Sure.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.732
Back in high school...

04:31.004 --> 04:34.405
...I had a major crush on you.

04:34.741 --> 04:35.730
I knew.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.337
You did?

04:39.279 --> 04:42.180
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.414
I did.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.415
Listen, do you think

04:48.688 --> 04:52.124
Try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.127
Would it be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.430
Maybe.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.904
Okay, maybe I will.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.200
See, I see...

05:10.443 --> 05:12.638
...big passion in your future.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.636
-Really?
-I do.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.212
Ross, you're so great.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.119
It's never gonna happen.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.898
I have a question.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.436
Actually, it's not
so much a question.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.163
It's more of a general wondering...

05:41.974 --> 05:43.441
...ment.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.141
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to....

05:52.452 --> 05:53.919
Yes, yes.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.276
That's right.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.682
Look!

05:57.423 --> 05:58.617
What?

06:00.493 --> 06:02.654
Top of the world looking

06:03.329 --> 06:04.921
Down on creation

06:05.198 --> 06:09.464
And the only explanation I can find

06:10.803 --> 06:15.536
Listen, missy! If you want this cart,
you'll have to take me with it!

06:21.013 --> 06:22.878
-Did you see that?
-You were incredible!

06:23.149 --> 06:25.709
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.284
I could not have done this
without you.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.892
More clothes in the dryer?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.292
I'm fine.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.197
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.066
I was doing great with Julie
before I found out.

06:49.308 --> 06:53.972
I was doing great too. It's not
easy for me to see you with Julie.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.875
I don't need this right now.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.842
It's too late.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.020
I'm with somebody else.
This ship has sailed!

07:02.221 --> 07:04.689
All right, fine!
Go ahead and do that.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.257
I don't need your stupid ship!

07:55.942 --> 07:59.400
This is the first time I'm doing
something I care about.

07:59.645 --> 08:03.206
I'm doing something
that I'm actually good at.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.814
If you don't get that

08:05.117 --> 08:09.053
I get that, but I'm tired
of your answering machine.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.722
I don't know what to do.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.948
Neither do l!

08:13.459 --> 08:14.585
Is this about Mark?

08:16.395 --> 08:17.384
Oh, my God!

08:17.630 --> 08:19.427
Okay, it's not.

08:20.132 --> 08:23.397
I can't keep having this
same fight over and over again.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.264
You're making this too hard!

08:26.472 --> 08:28.633
I am?
What do you want me to do?

08:28.841 --> 08:32.777
I don't know. Look, maybe
we should just take a break.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.947
You're right. Let's cool off.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.810
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.316
A break from us.

08:47.994 --> 08:51.828
-Why are we rushing?
-The girlfriend I told you about.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.091
She wants to get back
together with me.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.257
I found it!

08:56.502 --> 08:58.595
That's so great for you guys!

08:59.772 --> 09:02.798
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.877
-You got my message?
-You are right on time.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.519
Can I be your girlfriend again?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.213
You can very much.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.960
I want you to leave.
Get out!

09:25.197 --> 09:27.028
I want to talk about this.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.497
All right, how was she?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.668
-What?
-Was she good?

09:36.876 --> 09:37.865
Don't answer!

09:40.212 --> 09:43.579
You wanted to talk about it.
How was she?

09:44.917 --> 09:45.906
She was....

09:46.152 --> 09:49.747
-She was not good, not good.
-Nothing compared to you.

09:50.656 --> 09:51.645
She was different.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.384
Good different?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.728
Nobody likes change.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.697
Just stop!

10:03.603 --> 10:05.628
The way you owned up to everything.

10:05.938 --> 10:10.204
It's just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

10:10.710 --> 10:14.578
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.943
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

10:22.955 --> 10:26.391
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

10:26.659 --> 10:31.392
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective.

10:34.066 --> 10:37.229
We were on a break!

10:47.947 --> 10:49.505
You seem to really like her.

10:49.715 --> 10:53.446
What do I do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.550
No commitment.

10:56.155 --> 11:00.785
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

11:01.060 --> 11:03.460
...asking to hear stories about you...

11:03.729 --> 11:06.323
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.659
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.496
You think?

11:12.104 --> 11:16.234
You've got 14 hours until
she has to be at the airport.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.807
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

11:19.011 --> 11:22.242
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.081
-You're right.
-Yeah.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.657
This is so amazing!

11:43.335 --> 11:46.133
My brother's getting married
and in London!

11:46.338 --> 11:48.363
It's so romantic.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.700
Hey, pretty smart!

11:51.911 --> 11:52.935
Tissue paper.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.680
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.281
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.243
Isn't this adorable?

12:02.455 --> 12:05.049
Ross let Ben address mine.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.127
Did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.289
No.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.366
Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.530
I'm so jealous you're all going.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.902
I never knew you can't fly
in your third trimester.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.201
I didn't, either.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.070
I knew that.

12:26.879 --> 12:30.246
So I didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.406
What's up?

12:33.385 --> 12:35.080
Just hanging out.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.426
What's this?
Ross' wedding invitation?

12:44.130 --> 12:47.122
Maybe that's the one
we should have hidden.

12:47.867 --> 12:51.030
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.034
I'm happy for him.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.934
I am. I really

12:56.142 --> 12:57.575
I'll work on it.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.767
I'm sorry.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.942
You're going to come, though,
aren't you?

13:05.184 --> 13:06.776
I don't know.

13:07.186 --> 13:10.622
This isn't one of those
"lf she doesn't come, we don't come"?

13:10.856 --> 13:13.381
-I bought my ticket.
-You're not even invited.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.488
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.926
-Just say you'll think about it.
-I'll think about it.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.599
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross'.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.442
Oh, my God!

13:38.617 --> 13:39.845
He remembered.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.276
Remembered what?

13:41.687 --> 13:45.418
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.185
I saw this and told him
it was like one my grandmother had...

13:49.428 --> 13:51.760
...when I was a little girl.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.158
I can't believe he remembered!

13:54.333 --> 13:55.891
This must've cost a fortune.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.295
I can't believe he did this.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.165
Remember when he fell in love
with Carol...

14:00.406 --> 14:03.466
...and got her
that expensive crystal duck?

14:04.743 --> 14:05.801
What did you just say?

14:17.423 --> 14:19.983
Oh, my God!

14:20.526 --> 14:23.427
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

14:27.666 --> 14:28.655
Oh, my God!

14:28.868 --> 14:31.701
-We were in school together.
-We haven't seen each other since.

14:31.937 --> 14:35.703
I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

14:35.975 --> 14:37.033
Julie!

14:38.677 --> 14:40.144
Isn't that great?

14:40.679 --> 14:44.979
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.420
That is so sweet!

14:54.727 --> 14:55.921
No, you hang up.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.719
No, you

14:59.265 --> 15:02.166
One, two, three.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.598
You didn't hang up!

15:05.838 --> 15:07.738
She didn't hang up either.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.402
Okay, no. No, you hang up.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.910
You!

15:21.453 --> 15:23.114
Ross, hi.

15:23.455 --> 15:24.581
It's Rachel.

15:25.457 --> 15:29.393
I'm just calling to say
that everything's fine.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.862
And I'm really happy for you...

15:32.264 --> 15:34.198
...and your cat.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.894
Obviously, I am over you.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.233
I am over you.

15:43.475 --> 15:48.469
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.046
I got a message from you.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.753
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone!

15:56.055 --> 15:57.989
Give me the phone!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.830
You're over me?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.465
Oh, God.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.564
You're over me?

16:16.442 --> 16:18.433
When were you...

16:18.677 --> 16:20.338
...under me?

16:23.482 --> 16:24.744
Basically...

16:24.984 --> 16:26.975
...Iately, I've....

16:28.854 --> 16:31.584
I've sort of had feelings for you.

16:32.591 --> 16:33.751
I need to lie down.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.629
He broke up with Julie!

16:38.664 --> 16:41.360
Go hug her, for God's sakes!

16:43.135 --> 16:45.160
-Really?
-Really.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.702
It's always been you, Rach.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.202
Oh, God.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.117
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.454
That's okay.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.520
You're worth the wait.

17:06.658 --> 17:08.853
And I don't just mean tonight.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.052
Oh, God!

17:38.357 --> 17:39.517
Honey.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.352
That's okay.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.885
No, you just rolled over
the juice box.

17:48.801 --> 17:53.636
Did you say anything to Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.570
I'm sorry.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.742
Was I not supposed to?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.242
You ended it!

18:06.418 --> 18:10.411
Because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.784
You still love me?

18:16.128 --> 18:20.531
What does this mean?
Do you want to get back together?

18:21.533 --> 18:22.761
Maybe.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.695
I don't know.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.967
I just, I feel....

18:37.916 --> 18:42.478
I can't believe I even thought of
getting back together. We're so over!

18:44.456 --> 18:46.151
Fine by me!

18:47.392 --> 18:50.919
And hey! Just so you know,
it's not that common.

18:51.163 --> 18:54.792
It doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.598
I knew it!

19:08.213 --> 19:11.376
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty?

19:13.619 --> 19:14.984
Oh, my God!

19:15.187 --> 19:17.212
This is us getting ready
for the prom.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.114
We don't have to watch this.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.281
Yeah, we do!

19:21.560 --> 19:22.618
Come on!

19:23.195 --> 19:26.358
-Get a shot of Monica.
-How do you zoom out?

19:26.632 --> 19:28.395
There she is!

19:30.135 --> 19:33.036
Shut up!
The camera adds 10 pounds.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.832
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

19:37.075 --> 19:38.872
Dad, turn it off!

19:39.144 --> 19:40.372
It is off.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.069
Right, Ross?

19:46.752 --> 19:48.913
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!

19:51.223 --> 19:55.216
I can't go to my prom without a date.
It's too late.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.725
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.965
I have a wonderful idea.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.396
You should take Rachel to the prom.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.364
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.663
-I want to see!
-Fine, I'm not going to watch.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.033
Come on, kid. Let's go.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.906
Are you handsome!

20:13.145 --> 20:14.703
Let's show them!

20:18.917 --> 20:21.385
-Okay, Dad.
-Rachel, ready or not.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.087
Here comes your knight in shining

20:31.263 --> 20:32.821
Oh, dear!

20:33.165 --> 20:34.757
How do I turn this off?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.161
I can't believe you did that.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.770
Yeah, well....

20:59.258 --> 21:01.590
See? He's her lobster!

21:10.936 --> 21:12.961
No.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.406
You're really not going?

21:16.541 --> 21:18.873
It's just going to be too hard.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.470
You know, I mean...

21:21.747 --> 21:23.544
...it's Ross.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.809
How can I watch him get married?

21:28.220 --> 21:31.417
It's just for the best.
You know? It is.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.352
Plus somebody's got
to stay here with Phoebe.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.357
She's going to be pretty big by then.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.156
She'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.994
Drive her to the hospital
if she goes into labor.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.561
You don't have a car.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.706
And your license expired.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.706
There's so much to do,
and I have so little time!

21:58.950 --> 22:00.349
Check this out.

22:00.552 --> 22:04.010
There's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

22:04.222 --> 22:07.055
"It's almost as good as being there."

22:07.392 --> 22:10.987
It's better! You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.395
You could, but just the one time.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.662
We could get videos
of the sights...

22:18.870 --> 22:22.431
...get a VCR in our hotel room
and never have to go outside!

22:23.041 --> 22:29.537
-lf we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.
-I bet the British version is good!
