WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:05.605
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

00:06.273 --> 00:11.108
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.075
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.249
But when it does, it's exciting.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.414
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.220
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.088
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.461
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

00:33.234 --> 00:36.601
No, you just said "dad."
And everywhere I go today...

00:36.804 --> 00:39.364
... I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.872
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.280
Which is my father's last name.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.213
And they were serving franks...

00:50.451 --> 00:53.443
...which is his first name
minus the "s" at the end.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.590
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.783
His lndian name?

01:01.662 --> 01:06.065
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

01:06.734 --> 01:10.295
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.734
-Very freaky.
-Eerie.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.736
Who wants the last hamburger?

01:14.975 --> 01:17.102
That's it.
Now I have to go see him.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.376
Why?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.173
Hamburger? McDonald's?

01:21.849 --> 01:24.818
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

01:26.818 --> 01:32.818
And ei ei oh,
It's what your mom said when you father left you.

01:33.418 --> 01:35.418
Yes! really? No!

01:38.121 --> 01:40.089
The One With the Bullies

02:25.268 --> 02:27.395
Man, I am so beat.

02:28.471 --> 02:30.598
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.273
Yeah, all right.

02:34.511 --> 02:37.810
-Hey, you're in our seats.
-Sorry, we didn't know.

02:38.015 --> 02:39.573
We were sitting there.

02:40.150 --> 02:42.983
Okay.
There is one more way to say it.

02:43.187 --> 02:44.779
Who knows it?

02:46.423 --> 02:50.826
-Was that supposed to be funny?
-Actually, I was going for colorful.

02:51.195 --> 02:53.459
-What's with this guy?
-What's with you?

02:53.664 --> 02:55.757
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

02:55.966 --> 02:57.456
Enjoy your coffee.

03:04.375 --> 03:05.967
What just happened?

03:07.444 --> 03:10.811
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

03:11.048 --> 03:13.983
My joke is that I took your hat.

03:14.218 --> 03:16.379
That is funny.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.546
Can I have it back?

03:27.064 --> 03:29.862
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.661
Kudos on that hat joke.

03:34.972 --> 03:37.964
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

03:38.542 --> 03:39.474
Why should we?

03:40.678 --> 03:42.703
Because it's a special hat.

03:43.814 --> 03:46.612
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

03:46.817 --> 03:48.079
So he got the hat...

03:48.352 --> 03:50.650
...to cheer himself up, you know?

03:51.188 --> 03:54.419
-Chandler
-Stop talking. Stop talking now.

03:56.193 --> 03:58.525
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

03:58.829 --> 03:59.761
You got a problem?

04:00.030 --> 04:02.828
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.828
I'm telling you Rach,
I've gone dead hunting with Phabby before.

04:09.128 --> 04:12.128
It's a very scary thing for her,
and she is very vunlerable.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.128
That's why we are there.
You know, be supported or crap.

04:18.128 --> 04:21.128
Ok, will you just let me know when to do witch.

04:24.469 --> 04:26.198
How'd the interview go?

04:26.571 --> 04:27.629
It bit.

04:28.974 --> 04:30.965
It was a 50s theme restaurant.

04:31.276 --> 04:34.734
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.674
I was a sous chef
at Cafe des Artistes.

04:37.883 --> 04:41.876
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

04:42.487 --> 04:44.387
-Don't do it.
-How can I not do it?

04:44.623 --> 04:46.386
I have $127 in the bank!

04:46.658 --> 04:49.593
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

04:49.795 --> 04:51.092
I don't want a beer.

04:51.296 --> 04:52.763
Who said it was for you?

05:01.473 --> 05:02.770
What's the matter?

05:02.974 --> 05:06.102
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

05:06.411 --> 05:08.106
-No!
-You're kidding?

05:08.313 --> 05:10.781
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

05:10.982 --> 05:12.950
Actual bullies.

05:13.151 --> 05:17.087
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.685
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.

05:26.498 --> 05:29.023
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

05:29.334 --> 05:33.430
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

05:35.774 --> 05:37.537
-I went up!
-What?

05:37.809 --> 05:41.040
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

05:41.279 --> 05:45.477
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

05:45.684 --> 05:49.450
...that l'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

05:50.722 --> 05:52.485
You know what?
I'm going to do it.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.653
-Do what?
-Put all my money in me.

05:55.861 --> 05:58.694
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

05:58.897 --> 06:02.025
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

06:02.234 --> 06:03.496
Yes, Manhattan.

06:04.302 --> 06:06.497
Telephone number for the stock...

06:06.972 --> 06:08.735
...selling store.

06:19.251 --> 06:22.084
See? I told you these pillows
would be a good idea.

06:22.754 --> 06:23.846
Oh, God.

06:24.756 --> 06:25.916
Here we go.

06:27.058 --> 06:30.653
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, Birth Father!"

06:31.596 --> 06:33.223
-We love you. We're here for you.
-Good luck.

06:33.498 --> 06:34.658
Thanks.

06:38.570 --> 06:40.936
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

06:41.173 --> 06:42.697
What is in that?

06:42.908 --> 06:45.069
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

06:45.343 --> 06:48.210
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

06:52.350 --> 06:54.875
-Run, Phoebe, run!
-No, no, doggy, please!

06:55.086 --> 06:58.681
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

06:58.957 --> 07:01.016
-You got a bone?
-Are you kidding?

07:01.226 --> 07:03.421
Look, kibbles! Bits!

07:04.362 --> 07:07.593
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

07:14.706 --> 07:17.106
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

07:17.709 --> 07:20.200
Why don't you take his trampoline?

07:20.812 --> 07:22.803
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

07:25.217 --> 07:28.243
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

07:28.720 --> 07:32.247
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

07:32.891 --> 07:36.486
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

07:36.795 --> 07:38.228
What does that tell you?

07:39.164 --> 07:42.895
-lf he's not going to eat it, I will.
-Are you crazy?

07:43.101 --> 07:44.762
He's just a little dog.

07:52.010 --> 07:53.136
-Hey.
-What?

07:53.379 --> 07:56.177
Do you have to be a Century 21
real-estate agent...

07:56.382 --> 07:58.714
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

08:00.853 --> 08:03.549
Do you say this stuff to girls?

08:06.258 --> 08:09.352
Isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

08:09.595 --> 08:11.426
And look where they're sitting.

08:14.400 --> 08:18.734
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

08:19.004 --> 08:21.199
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

08:21.407 --> 08:24.035
This couch belongs to us.

08:24.276 --> 08:27.370
I'll tell you what,
you call the couch...

08:28.013 --> 08:30.345
...and then we'll call the couch...

08:32.017 --> 08:34.383
...and we'll see who it comes to.

08:38.383 --> 08:42.383
You know what I don't like you.
You always got something to say.

08:46.787 --> 08:50.484
You know, I keep wondering
why you two are still sitting here.

08:50.691 --> 08:52.022
All right, that's it.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.689
I have had enough of this.

08:55.229 --> 08:56.218
Gunther.

08:57.665 --> 09:00.361
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.798
Fellas, these guys were here first.

09:04.038 --> 09:05.869
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

09:06.307 --> 09:07.331
There you go.

09:07.541 --> 09:09.532
Thank you, Gunther.

09:12.546 --> 09:15.208
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.875
He told on us?

09:18.385 --> 09:19.579
You told on us?

09:19.820 --> 09:23.085
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

09:24.591 --> 09:26.855
-Don't play with his thing.
-I know.

09:29.229 --> 09:30.218
All right.

09:31.098 --> 09:32.861
Let's take this outside.

09:35.269 --> 09:38.500
"Let's take this outside?"

09:40.908 --> 09:43.103
Who talks like that?

09:43.410 --> 09:47.744
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

09:48.015 --> 09:49.573
You had to ask.

09:53.354 --> 09:55.686
Okay, okay, look. See...

09:55.956 --> 09:59.949
...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

10:01.128 --> 10:02.322
Here's the deal.

10:02.529 --> 10:07.466
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

10:12.906 --> 10:15.636
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

10:21.982 --> 10:24.246
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

10:24.918 --> 10:26.146
Yeah, I don't know.

10:28.155 --> 10:29.281
What's the matter?

10:29.490 --> 10:32.323
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

10:32.559 --> 10:35.585
Like the beast at the threshold.

10:37.064 --> 10:41.899
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

10:42.136 --> 10:45.128
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

10:45.339 --> 10:46.772
Despite what she says.

10:48.442 --> 10:53.379
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

10:54.748 --> 10:56.773
I don't know. This is my real father...

10:57.017 --> 11:00.350
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

11:00.587 --> 11:02.179
I completely understand.

11:02.456 --> 11:03.582
Whatever you need.

11:05.159 --> 11:06.922
Hey, you want to go home?

11:07.194 --> 11:09.424
Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

11:28.849 --> 11:30.510
What was that?

11:34.855 --> 11:37.688
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

11:43.129 --> 11:45.461
I want to buy five shares of SGJ.
Now.

11:45.698 --> 11:48.030
Come on, time is money, my friend!

11:48.400 --> 11:49.492
Thank you!

11:51.370 --> 11:53.304
"Time is money, my friend?"

11:53.506 --> 11:55.633
You missed "Takes money to make money"...

11:55.841 --> 11:59.800
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

12:00.412 --> 12:03.813
I made $ 17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

12:04.016 --> 12:07.645
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

12:09.088 --> 12:10.555
How did you make $17?

12:10.756 --> 12:13.054
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

12:13.359 --> 12:16.590
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

12:17.563 --> 12:18.757
How come those?

12:19.031 --> 12:23.559
Well, CHP because I used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

12:24.703 --> 12:28.104
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy."

12:29.074 --> 12:31.065
What happened to MEG?

12:31.277 --> 12:33.711
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

12:34.013 --> 12:37.107
My motto is, "Get out
before they go down."

12:38.450 --> 12:41.351
That is so not my motto.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.052
How's the dog?

12:49.295 --> 12:52.753
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

12:52.965 --> 12:56.594
He said the little fella's gonna be
okay, and I can get him tomorrow.

12:56.802 --> 12:58.429
-Good.
-Thank God.

12:58.637 --> 13:01.401
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

13:01.607 --> 13:05.634
And he said that only once in a blue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

13:06.212 --> 13:08.373
So still hoping.

13:10.783 --> 13:15.618
Now are you going to call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

13:15.988 --> 13:19.480
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.283
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

13:22.561 --> 13:25.052
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

13:26.165 --> 13:28.656
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

13:30.669 --> 13:34.230
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

13:34.940 --> 13:35.964
Don't...

13:38.077 --> 13:40.102
... be too long with the phone.

13:40.946 --> 13:44.109
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

13:47.086 --> 13:47.916
It's a woman.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.584
So talk to her.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.490
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

13:56.195 --> 13:58.493
I know where your dog is.

13:59.331 --> 14:03.927
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

14:04.169 --> 14:05.966
...within 24 hours.

14:06.171 --> 14:07.661
Goodbye.

14:14.546 --> 14:16.605
-Why the voice?
-Hard to say.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.616
Your cappuccino, sir.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.117
Thank you.

14:26.558 --> 14:29.959
-This is better than the coffeehouse.
-Absolutely.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.472
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

14:41.674 --> 14:44.142
The package says to keep it moving.

14:44.376 --> 14:46.742
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

14:52.318 --> 14:54.149
This is ridiculous.

14:54.353 --> 14:57.083
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

14:57.323 --> 15:01.692
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

15:01.927 --> 15:04.361
No problem. Joey's there.

15:09.401 --> 15:14.338
I don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time I want decent coffee.

15:14.673 --> 15:18.165
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k."

15:18.410 --> 15:21.504
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

15:21.714 --> 15:24.182
All right, hang on
a second there, Custer.

15:25.718 --> 15:28.186
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

15:28.387 --> 15:29.354
Yeah, sure.

15:29.755 --> 15:32.349
By someone besides Monica?

15:33.625 --> 15:34.489
So what?

15:34.693 --> 15:38.720
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

15:38.931 --> 15:41.923
Like a rite of passage or something.

15:42.201 --> 15:45.227
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

15:46.372 --> 15:49.136
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

15:50.136 --> 15:52.136
Are you go with me or not. Come on.

15:53.136 --> 15:58.136
All right, I'm go with you.
Just prepare clean underware for the hospital.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.038
-I need $100.
-What?

16:04.279 --> 16:05.871
Welcome home.

16:06.515 --> 16:07.948
-I need $100.
-For what?

16:08.150 --> 16:10.641
-To get back in the game.
-When did you get out?

16:10.852 --> 16:13.616
I lost it all. I lost it.

16:13.989 --> 16:17.220
I've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

16:20.162 --> 16:23.529
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.461
Where are we on the $100?

16:25.667 --> 16:26.861
I don't have it.

16:27.068 --> 16:28.660
But I need it!

16:29.504 --> 16:31.938
Otherwise, I'll have to
take that diner job.

16:32.140 --> 16:36.338
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

16:39.514 --> 16:42.642
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.312
Nobody does, honey.

16:50.258 --> 16:51.520
Noodle!

16:51.726 --> 16:56.163
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

16:56.398 --> 16:57.524
It was an accident.

16:57.732 --> 17:01.065
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

17:01.269 --> 17:02.930
She's a vegetarian.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.432
Are these stitches?

17:05.674 --> 17:09.269
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him.

17:10.178 --> 17:12.908
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up...

17:13.181 --> 17:15.342
... because that cone
will fill up fast.

17:17.219 --> 17:18.914
Thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

17:19.120 --> 17:22.248
-ls Frank home?
-How do you know Frank?

17:22.457 --> 17:25.517
Just from a long time ago.
Is he here?

17:31.366 --> 17:32.355
What?

17:34.436 --> 17:35.869
I mean Frank Senior.

17:36.071 --> 17:37.800
He went out for groceries.

17:38.039 --> 17:39.301
Will he be back soon?

17:39.774 --> 17:43.141
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.606
I'm gonna go.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.113
I'm sorry about the dog.
Everything.

17:49.384 --> 17:50.408
I'm sorry.

17:51.152 --> 17:52.210
Hey, lady!

17:52.654 --> 17:54.315
Hey, wait up!

17:58.994 --> 18:02.589
-How do you know my dad?
-Well, I don't really.

18:02.797 --> 18:05.595
Just genetically.

18:06.134 --> 18:08.398
He's kind of my dad too.

18:08.904 --> 18:09.893
Heavy.

18:12.340 --> 18:16.071
So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?

18:16.278 --> 18:18.838
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

18:21.082 --> 18:22.640
Except stilts.

18:23.618 --> 18:26.143
-Stilts?
-Yeah, he loved stilts.

18:26.354 --> 18:30.313
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

18:30.926 --> 18:33.292
...and all of a sudden I look over...

18:33.528 --> 18:36.361
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

18:38.199 --> 18:41.191
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

18:41.469 --> 18:44.302
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.878
I don't know what to do with that.

18:51.212 --> 18:52.611
Me neither.

18:55.984 --> 18:58.452
So are you, like, my big sister?

18:59.454 --> 19:02.150
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

19:03.358 --> 19:04.450
I'm not gonna.

19:05.694 --> 19:09.391
But you know what's cool? If you had
a friend named Pete, I could say...

19:09.664 --> 19:12.224
... "I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

19:12.968 --> 19:15.835
-I got a friend named Mark.
-That'll work too.

19:16.071 --> 19:16.901
Cool. All right.

19:18.006 --> 19:22.067
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

19:23.011 --> 19:24.638
We could talk or something.

19:24.879 --> 19:27.177
-Yeah, that'd be okay.
-All right.

19:27.382 --> 19:29.009
I'm in the book.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.646
So stilts, huh?

19:36.358 --> 19:40.727
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

19:45.533 --> 19:49.401
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

19:51.072 --> 19:54.405
-How long does coffee take?
-Would you come on? Come on!

19:56.444 --> 19:57.570
Thank you.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.457
-There we go.
-I think we proved our point.

20:13.728 --> 20:16.390
-You burn your mouth?
-Cannot feel my tongue.

20:21.069 --> 20:22.627
Bullies! Big bullies!

20:23.204 --> 20:26.367
Look who's here.
It's the weenies.

20:28.043 --> 20:30.773
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

20:30.979 --> 20:32.378
That's why we're here.

20:32.614 --> 20:34.912
Yes, we're standing our ground.

20:35.450 --> 20:37.281
Apparently.

20:37.619 --> 20:39.143
Let's do this already.

20:39.421 --> 20:40.445
You got a weapon?

20:41.623 --> 20:44.421
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

20:44.626 --> 20:45.888
All right, let's do this.

20:47.662 --> 20:52.292
Question: If I don't care about
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

20:52.567 --> 20:54.660
-What do you mean?
-It's sharp, it's metal.

20:54.936 --> 20:57.769
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

20:58.506 --> 21:00.337
No, you can't use your watch.

21:01.943 --> 21:03.672
Or your keys.

21:04.446 --> 21:05.845
Here's what we'll do.

21:06.147 --> 21:09.583
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

21:09.984 --> 21:11.008
All right?

21:13.021 --> 21:15.512
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

21:15.824 --> 21:19.316
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

21:19.627 --> 21:21.424
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

21:21.663 --> 21:24.928
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

21:26.167 --> 21:29.136
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

21:29.370 --> 21:32.669
...and this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

21:33.942 --> 21:35.273
Nothing from the neck up.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.873
Or the waist down.

21:39.814 --> 21:42.647
-Dana's ovulating.
-Really? You guys trying again?

21:43.985 --> 21:47.045
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

21:47.288 --> 21:48.186
Come on!

21:48.556 --> 21:52.219
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

21:54.062 --> 21:56.053
Those guys are taking our stuff!

22:01.002 --> 22:03.334
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

22:03.571 --> 22:06.472
-You guys kicked butt!
-Us? What about you guys?

22:06.674 --> 22:09.472
You really gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

22:09.744 --> 22:12.474
-He was a big guy.
-Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

22:12.680 --> 22:14.671
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

22:14.983 --> 22:17.008
Don't do that to yourself.

22:17.218 --> 22:21.052
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

22:23.324 --> 22:25.918
So listen, guys...

22:27.362 --> 22:28.590
...are we okay here?

22:30.932 --> 22:32.024
We're okay.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.329
So can I have my hat back?

22:50.952 --> 22:52.783
Oh, my God. Look at her.

22:53.855 --> 22:54.787
Hi, Monica!

22:56.257 --> 22:57.451
How's it going?

22:57.692 --> 22:59.091
Hey, nice boobs.

23:00.528 --> 23:02.359
Guys, guys. Check this out.

23:21.449 --> 23:22.973
Excellent.
