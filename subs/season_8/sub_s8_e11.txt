WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:06.400
Phoebe. Will you check out that guy
by the window. Wow!

00:06.573 --> 00:11.374
That guy back there? He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.343
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.374
Really?

00:18.018 --> 00:21.954
What is wrong with me lately?
It's like, every guy I see.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.113
I mean, look at that guy, for example.

00:24.291 --> 00:27.283
That's not someone
I would be attracted to.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.529
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling..

00:29.696 --> 00:33.962
all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants
and fanny pack.

00:34.601 --> 00:38.298
Wait a second! This is about the fourth
month of your pregnancy, right?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.440
-Yeah.
-This is completely normal.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.041
Around the fourth month,
your hormones start going crazy.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.508
-Really? So this has happened to you?
-Absolutely!

00:46.780 --> 00:49.010
And keep in mind now,
I was carrying triplets.

00:49.283 --> 00:53.617
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.489
Wow, this explains so much!

00:56.757 --> 01:01.558
Last weekend, I went from store to store,
sitting on Santas' laps.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.761
Yeah, I remember trying
to steal a cardboard cutout..

01:05.933 --> 01:08.993
of Evander Holyfield
from a Foot Locker.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.564
Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow.
I'll ask her about this.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.640
Maybe she can give me a pill
or something.

01:15.842 --> 01:18.333
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

01:20.314 --> 01:26.014
Oh, no. Short, crazy guy recognizes me.
Worst mistake of my life.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.183
Call me.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.657
I got our pictures developed
from Rockefeller Center.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.200
Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

02:17.771 --> 02:22.674
Ordinarily, I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

02:27.047 --> 02:30.710
Where are the pictures that that creepy
pretzel vendor took of us together?

02:30.951 --> 02:33.419
Oh, yeah.
Probably at the end.

02:33.687 --> 02:37.817
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures
of my breasts.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.720
I'm missing picture time!

02:44.865 --> 02:48.028
You know, she has a face, Ross.

02:49.169 --> 02:53.401
I didn't take these, okay? I didn't even
know my camera had a zoom lens.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.564
"Comma, officer."

02:56.043 --> 03:00.571
-Okay, here's a good one of us.
-Wow, that is a good one!

03:00.814 --> 03:02.577
It looks like a holiday card.

03:02.749 --> 03:06.845
With the tree in the middle
and the skaters and the snow.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.488
Good job, pretzel pervert.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.953
Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
holiday cards and I never do it.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.651
Do you want
to send this one out together?

03:19.900 --> 03:23.301
Together? Like, to people?

03:23.537 --> 03:27.997
Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona
and Ross." It'll be cute, okay?

03:28.241 --> 03:30.106
Okay.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.107
-I gotta get to work. Call me later?
-Sure, sure.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.507
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.054
Congratulations! You just got married!

03:42.055 --> 03:43.955
I know. Can you believe that?

03:44.157 --> 03:47.058
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

03:47.260 --> 03:50.718
Married couples send out cards.
Families send out cards.

03:50.964 --> 03:54.365
People who have been dating for
a couple of months don't send out cards.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.970
-What is she, crazy?
-That's your wife you're talking about!

03:59.740 --> 04:03.073
No, really. I mean,
that would be like a huge step forward.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.507
I like things just the way they are.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.477
I'm finally in a relationship
that's not moving too fast.

04:08.648 --> 04:12.482
You know, ordinarily,
I'd be divorced by now.

04:12.686 --> 04:16.520
Okay, so just tell her you don't wanna
send out the card. What's she gonna do?

04:16.690 --> 04:17.952
This.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.993
Oh, okay. I didn't mean
to put pressure on you..

04:22.162 --> 04:25.325
I just thought it would be something fun
for us to do together..

04:25.499 --> 04:28.332
but okay, that's okay.

04:30.504 --> 04:35.669
Okay, stop. Stop. You're right,
it's not that big a deal. I'll do the card.

04:38.845 --> 04:42.508
-What? I said I'd do it.
-I know, it's just..

04:42.682 --> 04:44.513
Can I have $20?

04:53.026 --> 04:57.429
-Hi. You ready for lunch?
-One second.

05:01.568 --> 05:05.436
-That's cute.
-Bing! And the Bingette!

05:05.605 --> 05:08.301
I thought it felt a little hotter
in the office today.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.711
-Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
-Yes. Hi.

05:12.879 --> 05:16.144
Good news! The divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.715
I didn't know you and Kara divorced.
I'm sorry.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.184
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

05:24.024 --> 05:28.051
-Congratulations to you guys, though.
-No leg-chewing for us, sir.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.661
Well, give it time.

05:31.131 --> 05:35.192
So the divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.166
How about we all go out
to dinner tomorrow night.

05:38.405 --> 05:41.033
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.142
Why can't I think
of anything we're doing?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.904
Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by 6.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.479
They keep throwing sexual harassment
cases at me..

05:49.649 --> 05:52.379
and I keep knocking them
out of the park!

05:52.586 --> 05:54.747
Okay, see you tomorrow.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.549
Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.186
Honey, once you get to know him,
he's much, much worse.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.794
I can't do this alone.

06:03.330 --> 06:07.391
Honey, I'm sorry. I can't help you. I can't
spend another evening with that man.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.297
Do you remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

06:10.470 --> 06:12.700
That's because he wasn't invited.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.500
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.907
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.923
Oh, what the hell? B plus.

06:42.669 --> 06:46.469
Hi! I went by the photo shop.
Take a look.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.164
Here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?

06:52.779 --> 06:54.371
Wow, that's great.

06:54.681 --> 06:58.082
Do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

06:58.518 --> 07:02.545
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet..

07:03.423 --> 07:06.586
but I guess it's okay
to say it to other people.

07:06.826 --> 07:10.887
-How many did you want? I'll get 100.
-A hundred?

07:13.133 --> 07:16.432
Well, I guess I'll take..

07:16.670 --> 07:18.661
Mona?

07:19.706 --> 07:24.803
I'm not sure
about the whole card thing.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.478
Really? Why not?

07:27.314 --> 07:31.216
Sending out a holiday card together?

07:31.484 --> 07:36.148
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.288
I didn't think of it that way.
You're right.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.126
-So can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.131
Where are we?

07:51.004 --> 07:55.100
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?

08:01.414 --> 08:05.942
I love spending time with you.
I just hope we're moving forward.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.485
We should talk about that,
don't you think?

08:17.030 --> 08:19.294
Let's do the card!

08:20.600 --> 08:24.661
-What?
-The card! I think we're there!

08:24.904 --> 08:28.499
Okay. But I still think
we should have this conversation.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.539
Really?

08:30.810 --> 08:33.802
Even with the card?

08:38.918 --> 08:44.322
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here
today, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.924
Oh, okay.
Can I ask you a question?

08:48.161 --> 08:52.689
Was it me, or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute?

08:52.966 --> 08:57.494
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

08:59.239 --> 09:02.174
Actually, never mind.
I just answered my own question.

09:02.742 --> 09:07.611
-Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
-Yes, you are.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.448
-Okay, now he's cute, right?
-Oh, God, yes.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.112
So, how's it going?

09:14.320 --> 09:17.949
It's going really good.
But enough about me! Come on.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.489
Where are you from?
What do you do?

09:21.728 --> 09:24.629
-I'm a doctor.
-Right. I meant..

09:24.798 --> 09:27.824
in your spare time.
Do you cook? So you ski?

09:28.101 --> 09:31.298
Or just hang out with your wife,
or girlfriend?

09:31.504 --> 09:34.803
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend,
but I do like to ski.

09:35.008 --> 09:39.240
I love to ski!
How amazing is this?

09:39.979 --> 09:44.473
-Are you experiencing any discomfort?
-No, I'm very comfortable.

09:44.684 --> 09:48.245
-Any painful gas?
-No!

09:49.355 --> 09:53.792
Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?

09:54.494 --> 09:57.486
Okay, then. Would you like
to lie down on the table?

09:57.697 --> 10:00.495
Would you like me
to lie down on the table?

10:01.634 --> 10:05.126
-Is there something going on here?
-Do you feel it too?

10:09.576 --> 10:13.307
-Hi.
-How did your doctor's appointment go?

10:13.546 --> 10:17.642
Well, let's see,
they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

10:17.851 --> 10:22.049
In the middle of the exam,
I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.553
-Oh, my God!
-Why did you do that?

10:25.792 --> 10:29.694
Remember that little problem I was having
during my fourth month of pregnancy?

10:29.896 --> 10:32.694
Oh, yeah!
The Evander Holyfield phase.

10:32.932 --> 10:37.096
Oh, man! You were so hard up,
you practically came on to me.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.567
You wish.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.940
Hey, I could have had you
if I wanted you.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.871
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

10:46.846 --> 10:51.510
Okay, even this is turning me on.
You guys, I got problems.

10:53.286 --> 10:57.484
Oh, hey. Hey, Ross!
How's it going with you and Mona?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.955
Are you guys still together?

11:00.894 --> 11:04.887
Yeah, we're moving forward.
You'll be getting our card.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.825
You're doing a holiday card?

11:08.067 --> 11:11.366
We're not just doing a card.
She also wants to have the conversation..

11:11.538 --> 11:13.563
about where the relationship
is going.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.740
Women!

11:15.909 --> 11:20.141
I know! Why do you guys need
to have this conversation?

11:20.313 --> 11:23.976
No self-respecting man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"

11:24.217 --> 11:25.946
Ross, you asked me that.

11:26.152 --> 11:31.055
You were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!

11:32.225 --> 11:35.353
What are you gonna say to her?
Where is this relationship going?

11:35.528 --> 11:39.897
I don't know. I really like her
and I wanna keep dating her.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.330
-So tell her that.
-No, I can't.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.596
Because then she's gonna say,
"Well, it's not moving anywhere..

11:45.772 --> 11:48.832
-then we should just break up."
-Yeah, that's true.

11:50.210 --> 11:55.773
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them. Really.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.645
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture..

11:58.885 --> 12:02.377
something that says we're moving
forward without having to talk about it.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.113
Like asking her
to move in with you?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.292
Smaller than that.

12:07.694 --> 12:11.061
-Making her a mix tape?
-Bigger than that.

12:11.297 --> 12:16.325
-Give her a key to your apartment.
-We were closer with the mix tape.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.003
Have you said, "I love you"?
You could say, "I love you."

12:19.205 --> 12:22.197
I don't think I'm quite there yet.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.967
But I could say,
"I love spending time with you."

12:26.179 --> 12:28.773
-We hate that.
-That is a slap in the face.

12:28.982 --> 12:33.885
Forget it. You know what?
I'll just have the conversation.

12:34.153 --> 12:39.250
I'll just say I like things the way
they are, and hope for the best.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.589
What do you think, Rach?

12:41.861 --> 12:45.092
I think if it was
a little colder in here..

12:45.331 --> 12:47.925
I could see your nipples
through that sweater.

12:52.405 --> 12:56.000
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.803
As it turns out, we can't do it.
Monica has to work.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.606
My ex-wife didn't work.

13:01.881 --> 13:05.339
Unless you call turning
into her mother "work."

13:06.452 --> 13:09.012
Fine. Tomorrow night then.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.953
-Tomorrow's no good for her, either.
-Why not?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.220
It's the semifinals..

13:16.462 --> 13:20.728
of her bocce ball tournament.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.993
Okay. The night after that then.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.832
Well, that's the finals, and I think
she's gonna go all the way, sir.

13:27.774 --> 13:34.009
What's going on, Bing? Does your wife
have a problem with me or something?

13:34.213 --> 13:36.841
Well, now you're just talking crazy.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.848
Then why can't the three of us
go out together?

13:40.119 --> 13:43.213
Because we split up.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.514
Monica and I split up.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.683
Hold me.

13:49.262 --> 13:53.699
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.

13:53.933 --> 13:59.098
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.

14:00.073 --> 14:04.100
And the way she looked at me,
pure lust.

14:04.344 --> 14:08.838
What would really help me through
this tough time is choking someone.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.183
I know how you feel. Oh, yeah.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.547
I know what it's like to give a woman
all your love..

14:14.721 --> 14:17.417
and then have that love
thrown back in your face.

14:17.590 --> 14:22.994
And then the court decides to give you
custody of those fat, left-handed twins.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.258
Well, they're lucky to have you, sir.

14:28.801 --> 14:32.066
Bing, my boy,
we're gonna get you over this.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.934
Here's the plan: Grab your coat,
we're going to a strip club!

14:36.142 --> 14:39.134
Oh, no!
Monica would freak.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.675
But to hell with that bitch!

14:45.385 --> 14:47.683
Here we go.

14:48.521 --> 14:54.858
Mona, it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.723
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.595
We are so..

15:06.839 --> 15:12.505
Well, I really like you.
And I love hanging out with you.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.977
And I'm having a lot of fun.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.146
Okay.

15:23.356 --> 15:28.157
There's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.

15:28.394 --> 15:32.524
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.859
So where is it going?

15:41.040 --> 15:44.908
That's the real question.

15:47.713 --> 15:51.080
And the answer is..

15:51.284 --> 15:54.845
it's going somewhere..

15:55.087 --> 15:57.351
fun.

15:58.391 --> 16:03.658
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

16:03.896 --> 16:07.354
But you're not getting any younger.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.263
No! I mean, not you.
Not you.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.405
You are getting younger!

16:13.673 --> 16:19.168
You're getting younger by the second.
What's your secret?

16:21.380 --> 16:24.679
I'm sorry, so where are we?

16:25.051 --> 16:27.349
Well, to sum up..

16:30.790 --> 16:36.194
we're having fun.
You look young.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.833
-Okay..
-But that's not enough.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.004
So..

16:50.276 --> 16:54.736
here's a key to my apartment.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.939
-Really?
-Really.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.213
You don't think this is too fast?

17:05.124 --> 17:07.752
You gave her a key
to your apartment?

17:07.927 --> 17:12.660
Not just a key.
I gave her the only key!

17:14.133 --> 17:18.661
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship!

17:20.072 --> 17:24.338
-Why did you give her a key?
-She talked me into a corner, okay?

17:24.510 --> 17:28.071
She's like this conversational wizard.

17:28.814 --> 17:32.250
So you had the conversation
you didn't wanna have..

17:32.418 --> 17:35.285
and you made the gesture
you didn't wanna make.

17:35.454 --> 17:39.788
Did I start this by saying, "Hey,
I did something awesome today"?

17:39.959 --> 17:44.191
-Do either of you have a key to my place?
-I don't think you've ever given us keys.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.092
Yeah, why would I? It's my home.

17:49.368 --> 17:54.032
-Ross, how did the conversation go?
-Great. I live on the street.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.337
Where?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.341
-Hi.
-Okay, Monica, Rachel..

18:00.546 --> 18:03.276
-this is my friend Roger.
-Hi, Roger.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.483
I'll get us some drinks.
Could you help me?

18:07.720 --> 18:10.086
Yeah, okay.

18:15.394 --> 18:18.158
He's here to have sex with you.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.259
-What?
-You're welcome.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.999
-Phoebe, no!
-It's okay. He's a virgin.

18:33.679 --> 18:38.480
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
I think he'll have sex with you.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.249
Let's leave these two alone.

18:41.487 --> 18:47.050
No! I don't care what my hormones are
doing! I won't do it with some random guy!

18:47.493 --> 18:51.429
Fine! Then you tell Roger, because
he was really looking forward to this!

19:08.614 --> 19:12.675
Bing! Look at those twin sisters
dancing together.

19:13.552 --> 19:16.851
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls.

19:17.056 --> 19:21.356
That's all right, sir.
And that's just one girl.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.653
-Bing, what's this?
-It's a hand.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.161
It's a thing you use
as a Jack and Coke holder.

19:28.434 --> 19:33.497
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.
We'll throw it in the East River!

19:33.706 --> 19:35.139
-No!
-Yes!

19:35.341 --> 19:40.335
I did it, and I felt a lot better! You
might even hit a seagull in the head.

19:42.248 --> 19:46.207
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch
of extra keys.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.512
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.

19:52.158 --> 19:55.525
Ross, what's going on?
You're changing the lock?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.060
No.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.220
That guy is.

19:59.598 --> 20:03.694
You give me a key to your apartment,
and then you change the lock?

20:05.271 --> 20:07.171
Good luck, buddy.

20:10.276 --> 20:15.942
I thought we were moving forward. Now
you're sending me all these mixed signals.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.012
What are you trying to tell me?

20:19.552 --> 20:22.851
I'm trying to tell you..

20:23.622 --> 20:26.455
I made you a mix tape.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.454
-What?
-I love you.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.094
And I love spending time with you.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.744
-Hi, honey, I'm home.
-From the tequila factory?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.081
It was awful.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.584
To get out of going to dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.757
So then he took me to these strip clubs
and sleazy bars.

20:58.991 --> 21:03.758
When I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.

21:04.396 --> 21:08.162
Come here.
I can breathe through my mouth.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.432
-Oh, sweetie.
-You know what the worst part was?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.004
I got to see what my life
would be like without you.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.640
It was like It's a Wonderful Life
with lap dances.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.548
Please promise me
that you'll never leave me..

21:23.816 --> 21:28.515
that we'll grow old together, and be
with each other for the rest of our lives.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.454
I promise.

21:32.057 --> 21:36.221
Speaking of together, how about
we send out a holiday card this year?

21:36.462 --> 21:39.124
I don't know if we're there yet.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.230
I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?

21:46.472 --> 21:51.967
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

21:52.178 --> 21:54.738
-I'll call you back.
-Who was that?

21:54.980 --> 21:59.178
-It's just the pizza place.
-You hung up on the pizza place?

21:59.451 --> 22:02.386
I don't hang up on your friends.

22:02.588 --> 22:06.080
-Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
-What's wrong?

22:06.358 --> 22:10.488
-You don't want to hear about it.
-Then why did I ask?

22:10.729 --> 22:15.666
Okay, this is really embarrassing, but
lately, with this whole pregnancy thing..

22:15.901 --> 22:19.393
I'm just finding myself..

22:19.672 --> 22:21.902
How do I put this?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.900
Erotically charged.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.775
Is that college talk for "horny"?

22:30.482 --> 22:35.681
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
and I don't know what to do about them.

22:35.888 --> 22:40.052
I can't date like a normal person, which is
fine because I don't need a relationship.

22:40.292 --> 22:44.126
All I really want is one great night!
Just sex.

22:44.396 --> 22:46.990
No strings attached.
No relationship.

22:47.233 --> 22:51.761
With someone I feel comfortable with,
and who knows what he's doing.

22:52.037 --> 22:57.634
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard..

22:58.944 --> 23:01.276
to find?

23:06.118 --> 23:08.109
So how was your day?

23:08.320 --> 23:12.586
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

23:17.329 --> 23:20.423
Well, I gotta get up early,
and it's almost 7:00.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.067
-I gotta go to my room.
-Good night!

23:23.302 --> 23:25.293
Good night!

23:28.040 --> 23:30.600
-I can't do it!
-I didn't ask you to do it!

23:30.809 --> 23:32.242
-You're Rachel!
-You're Joey!

23:32.411 --> 23:34.140
-You're my friend!
-Right back at you.

23:34.313 --> 23:38.613
Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong,
and weird and bad!

23:38.817 --> 23:42.776
So bad! But I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't ask you to do anything!

23:42.955 --> 23:44.650
I know!

23:53.632 --> 23:55.065
-You wanna do it?
-No!

23:55.267 --> 23:59.101
-I'm just testing you!
-Well, that's the end of this conversation!

23:59.271 --> 24:01.637
-This conversation never happened!
-Never happened!

24:01.807 --> 24:04.105
-Good night!
-Good night!

24:10.182 --> 24:11.843
Get back in there!

24:19.625 --> 24:23.425
Listen, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.

24:23.595 --> 24:26.462
It really wasn't right.
And I want to make it up to you.

24:26.632 --> 24:31.831
So I brought you something
I think you'll really enjoy.

24:39.411 --> 24:44.872
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.943
I'm gonna go now.

24:52.291 --> 24:55.124
I'm sorry.
I thought I could do it, and I can't.
