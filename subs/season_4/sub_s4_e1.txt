00:02.235 --> 00:04.726
Phoebe found out about this lady...

00:04.938 --> 00:09.034
...who knew her parents,
and I don't know what happened.

00:09.309 --> 00:10.901
I'm your mother.

00:11.644 --> 00:14.772
Monica joked she
wouldn't date Chandler.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.882
I don't know what
happened there either.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.314
Ross' new girlfriend shows up.

00:20.553 --> 00:24.455
Rachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.
Then they kiss.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.820
Now he has to choose
Rachel or the bald girl.

00:28.161 --> 00:30.254
I don't know what
happened there either.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.931
Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.611
She's helping me.
My head's sunburned.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.821
-Thanks a million.
-You're welcome a million.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.993
Smell it.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.621
Minty.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.059
I'll be in our room.

01:23.483 --> 01:24.677
Oh, my God!

01:24.884 --> 01:26.374
I know.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.521
I got to go.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.054
I got to go break up with Bonnie.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.221
Here? Now?

01:38.465 --> 01:40.296
I can't stay here all night.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.400
If I go in there, she'll want to...

01:44.104 --> 01:45.093
...do stuff.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.002
Can't you say
you aren't in the mood?

01:49.175 --> 01:50.665
No, she likes that.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.374
Faking sleep doesn't work.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.207
I've woken up many times with her

02:00.086 --> 02:03.055
-Why am I telling you?
-I don't know.

02:12.265 --> 02:15.291
-Not every morning
-Making it worse!

02:16.769 --> 02:18.669
The One with the Jellyfish

03:04.417 --> 03:07.386
You probably want to know
how it happened.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.088
I think I can figure it out.

03:10.356 --> 03:14.156
I was born, and then
everyone lied their asses off.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.362
No, it wasn't like that.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.189
Remember how I said
Lilly, Frank and I were close?

03:22.468 --> 03:24.026
We were very close.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.669
How close?

03:25.872 --> 03:29.467
The three of us were
kind of a couple.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.745
I don't know how that would work.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.039
I'm not asking!

03:36.416 --> 03:38.941
Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

03:39.652 --> 03:41.142
...and I was...

03:41.621 --> 03:45.113
...scared.
I was stupid and selfish....

03:45.992 --> 03:50.452
I was 18 years old.
Remember what it was like to be 18?

03:50.663 --> 03:53.496
Mom killed herself
and my dad ran off.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.669
I lived in a Gremlin with a guy
who talked to his hand.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.343
I'm sorry. I thought I'd left you
with the best parents.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.377
I didn't hear about them
till a few years ago.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.808
By then, you were already grown-up.

04:09.983 --> 04:14.579
You're here and I would
really like to get to know you.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.654
Well, everybody does.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.949
I'm a really cool person.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.128
You had 29 years to find out,
but you didn't even try.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.525
You walked out on me,
and I'll do the same.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.026
I don't ever want to see you again.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.943
Where's my purse?

04:39.846 --> 04:41.837
Shoot! We're out of soda.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.447
-I'll get you some.
-Really?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.017
No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.955
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

04:53.493 --> 04:56.929
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.665
I found a dried-up seahorse.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.103
What do you mean?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.274
My new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.245
Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

05:15.214 --> 05:16.977
I need to be alone.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.051
Man. Hey...

05:29.195 --> 05:32.528
...what if you found out that
your mom wasn't really your mom...

05:32.665 --> 05:36.362
...and your new mom turned
out to be really hot?

05:36.502 --> 05:39.403
Oh, man, huh?

05:40.540 --> 05:43.270
But, it's your mom.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.936
No, I'm talking about your mom.

05:55.822 --> 05:56.846
It's over.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.085
Was it awful?

06:00.259 --> 06:01.749
It was long.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.621
I didn't realize how late it was...

06:04.831 --> 06:07.857
...till I saw the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

06:13.272 --> 06:17.333
She didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

06:25.017 --> 06:27.008
I wrote you a letter.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.117
Oh, thank you!

06:30.223 --> 06:32.020
I like mail.

06:36.295 --> 06:40.425
It's just some things I've been
thinking about. About us.

06:40.666 --> 06:44.102
Before we even think about us
getting back together...

06:44.337 --> 06:47.397
...I need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.011
It's 5:30 in the morning.

07:02.889 --> 07:06.347
So I'd better get
cracking on this baby.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.459
I'll be waiting for you.
Come up when you're done.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.533
I'll be up...

07:15.368 --> 07:16.835
...in 18 pages.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.302
Front and back.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.006
Very exciting!

07:50.036 --> 07:52.504
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

07:53.206 --> 07:54.332
Done.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.373
-You just finished?
-I wanted to be thorough.

08:00.079 --> 08:05.244
This is clearly
very important to you. To us.

08:05.418 --> 08:09.184
I wanted to read
every word carefully.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.652
Twice.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.928
Does it?

08:22.368 --> 08:24.302
I'm sorry?

08:25.538 --> 08:27.130
Does it?

08:28.274 --> 08:32.335
Does it? Does it?

08:35.147 --> 08:39.811
I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part another glance.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.080
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.951
It either does or doesn't.
If you have to think

08:47.193 --> 08:50.458
No, I don't have to think about it.

08:50.663 --> 08:51.925
In fact...

08:52.698 --> 08:55.428
...I've decided.
I have decided...

08:55.935 --> 08:57.596
...that it...

09:03.109 --> 09:04.474
...does.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.195
-Are you sure?
-Sure, I'm sure!

09:31.470 --> 09:35.634
There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.203
Would you go out with me?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.950
I've got canned goods.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.079
Take a look at this!

09:49.322 --> 09:52.450
Check this baby out!
Dug me a hole.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.586
Excellent hole, Joe.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.595
Oh, no! My hole!

10:00.766 --> 10:02.256
My foot!

10:03.302 --> 10:04.428
What is it?

10:04.804 --> 10:07.932
Jellyfish sting!
It hurts!

10:08.207 --> 10:10.198
Can we help you to the house?

10:10.409 --> 10:11.740
It's two miles.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.208
And I'm tired from digging.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.544
Damn the jellyfish!

10:17.783 --> 10:20.251
Damn all the jellyfish!

10:20.453 --> 10:21.750
Do something.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.455
There's only one thing.

10:23.656 --> 10:24.748
What is it?

10:24.991 --> 10:26.253
Pee on it.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.084
Gross!

10:30.329 --> 10:32.490
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

10:32.798 --> 10:36.131
He's right.
There's ammonia in that...

10:36.802 --> 10:38.167
...that kills the pain.

10:38.437 --> 10:42.305
Forget it.
It doesn't hurt that bad!

10:43.509 --> 10:45.409
You can use my hole for privacy.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.144
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.780
Are you?

10:57.523 --> 10:59.423
That's so great!

10:59.759 --> 11:00.919
Not for Bonnie.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.453
But for you, yea!

11:06.499 --> 11:09.832
-How was the beach?
-Nothing. I don't know.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.506
-What happened?
-Nothing.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.175
-I'm going to shower.
-Me too.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.637
Me too.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.606
I'll put this in the car.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.008
I have to go pack!

11:25.384 --> 11:28.012
-And it really does?
-lt does.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.313
It really and truly does.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.810
It so does not!

12:01.921 --> 12:06.449
She wants me to take responsibility
for everything that went wrong.

12:07.093 --> 12:11.928
She goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

12:12.631 --> 12:15.225
We were on a break!

12:15.501 --> 12:19.665
If you say that one more time,
I'll break up with you.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.736
This breakup was not all my fault.
She says here...

12:25.044 --> 12:27.842
..."lf you accept full responsibility...

12:28.047 --> 12:30.572
...I can begin to trust you again.

12:30.783 --> 12:34.446
Does that seem like
something you can do? Does it?"

12:39.792 --> 12:43.057
You have what you want.
You're back with her.

12:43.295 --> 12:46.230
If you bring this up now,
you'll wreck it.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.864
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.331
I'll let it go.

12:52.638 --> 12:55.801
But you know how hard it is
to forget this?

12:56.075 --> 12:57.633
Sure, it's hard...

12:57.910 --> 13:00.640
...but you don't have to talk about it.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.947
A lot happened on that trip...

13:04.150 --> 13:07.313
...that we should
never, ever talk about.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.117
What happened on that beach?

13:13.826 --> 13:16.818
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.804
Hi, Ursula.

13:29.241 --> 13:32.836
I know that we haven't talked
in a long time.

13:33.145 --> 13:37.878
Our mom is not our birth mom.
This other lady is our birth mom.

13:38.117 --> 13:41.245
Right, the one that lives in Montauk.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.709
You know her?

13:42.988 --> 13:46.719
No. I read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

13:46.992 --> 13:51.224
There was a suicide note?
Do you still have it?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.756
Hang on.

13:56.101 --> 13:59.036
I can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.500
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.139
Shut up!

14:08.647 --> 14:11.343
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.041
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

14:15.354 --> 14:16.787
You just wrote this!

14:18.290 --> 14:20.884
It's pretty much the gist.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.289
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.591
All right. Hang on.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.565
Pass the cheese, please.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.816
You can't even look at me, can you?

14:47.753 --> 14:50.119
It's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!

14:52.424 --> 14:54.187
I'm too depressed to talk.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.621
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.

14:57.763 --> 15:01.961
What about making that
beach trip an annual thing?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.204
What happened out there?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.970
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

15:10.242 --> 15:13.109
I came back with nothing all over me.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.410
What happened?
Joey?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.209
All right.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.384
We swore we'd never tell.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.644
They'll never understand.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.657
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive!

15:32.665 --> 15:35.930
-Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
-All right!

15:43.876 --> 15:45.537
I got stung.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.508
Stung bad.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.244
I couldn't stand.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.447
I couldn't walk.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.247
We were two miles from the house.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.616
We were scared and alone.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.818
We didn't think we could make it.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.824
I was in too much pain.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.162
And I was tired from digging.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.335
Then Joey remembered something.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.776
I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.640
Wait, I saw that.

16:22.848 --> 16:27.308
On the Discovery Channel.
About jellyfish and how if you

16:31.890 --> 16:33.448
You peed on yourself?

16:35.661 --> 16:38.755
You can't say that!
You don't know!

16:39.264 --> 16:41.562
I thought I would pass out.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.429
I tried, but I couldn't...

16:45.838 --> 16:47.100
...bend that way.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.814
That's right.
I stepped up.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.051
She's my friend and she needed help.

17:05.591 --> 17:07.991
If I had to,
I'd pee on any of you.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.723
Only...

17:14.933 --> 17:16.093
...I couldn't.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.730
I got the stage fright.

17:23.175 --> 17:27.111
I wanted to help,
but there was too much pressure.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.438
So I turned to Chandler.

17:32.718 --> 17:37.121
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it now!"

17:38.557 --> 17:42.288
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.663
Because I do it through my wall
to freak you out.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.327
Maybe there's somebody
you guys could talk to.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.097
Oh, who?

17:53.238 --> 17:56.366
It's not like they have a group
for people like us.

17:57.209 --> 18:00.804
Yeah, no, there's this
guy Owen, he's the best.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.345
Might have his card.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.513
And fuchsia and mauve

18:09.188 --> 18:13.557
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom

18:16.128 --> 18:20.690
I invite all of you to count
the colors in your bedroom.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.999
Except for you.
You go away.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.031
I'll go in a second.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.209
I just want to tell you...

18:32.478 --> 18:36.312
...there wasn't a day
I didn't regret giving you up.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.240
Okay, bye.

18:40.018 --> 18:41.212
I'm not done.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.878
The reason I never
looked you up was because...

18:45.257 --> 18:47.191
...I was afraid you'd react...

18:47.426 --> 18:50.759
...just like the way
you're reacting now.

18:51.029 --> 18:54.465
Can't we just start from here?
Please?

18:56.101 --> 18:57.966
No.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.840
Sorry.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.179
One last thing.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.815
You came looking for family.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.979
I'm family.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.218
I'm it.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.688
Now I'm done.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.028
It's not like we're losing anything.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.899
I guess you're right.

19:32.404 --> 19:36.807
It's not like we know each other
or have anything in common.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.107
I don't know.
It's not like...

19:39.311 --> 19:41.973
...we don't have anything in common.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.081
I mean, I like pizza.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.512
I like pizza!

19:50.489 --> 19:52.957
Wait, I like the Beatles.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.692
Oh, my God!
So do l.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.055
Puppies.
Cute or ugly?

19:59.231 --> 20:01.222
So cute!

20:02.668 --> 20:04.135
You see?

20:04.836 --> 20:06.804
But I'm still mad at you.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.530
I know.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.475
I'm mad at me too.

20:13.145 --> 20:17.514
Do you want to get something to eat?
I'm kind of hungry.

20:17.849 --> 20:19.680
Hey! Me too!

20:19.851 --> 20:21.876
Uncanny.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.123
It looks like rain
and I don't have my umbrella.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.781
Me neither. I really hate that.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.657
Stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.330
I missed you.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.436
I missed you too.

20:44.276 --> 20:47.268
I was so nervous about that letter.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.515
But the way you
owned up to everything...

20:53.785 --> 20:57.243
...it just showed me
how much you've grown.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.456
I suppose.

21:02.194 --> 21:06.187
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.

21:06.498 --> 21:10.025
My mom never thought
this would work out.

21:11.036 --> 21:14.802
She said, "Once a cheater,
always a cheater."

21:18.810 --> 21:21.836
I just wish we hadn't
lost those four months.

21:22.481 --> 21:27.282
But if time was what you needed
to gain a little perspective....

21:28.987 --> 21:31.717
We were on a break!

21:32.924 --> 21:34.915
-Coffeehouse?
-You bet.

21:35.427 --> 21:39.488
It took two people
to break up this relationship.

21:39.731 --> 21:44.794
You and that girl, which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.800
I didn't know what
I took responsibility for.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.837
I didn't finish the letter.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.904
I fell asleep.

21:52.177 --> 21:54.168
You fell asleep?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.980
It was 5:30 in the morning.

21:58.216 --> 22:03.085
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.650
Front and back!

22:08.460 --> 22:13.329
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E
means "you are."

22:13.598 --> 22:15.225
Y-O-U-R means "your."

22:16.368 --> 22:21.237
I can't believe I thought of getting
back with you! We are so over.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.406
Fine by me!

22:25.711 --> 22:29.841
Those spelling tips will be handy
Saturday nights at home...

22:30.082 --> 22:31.947
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.846
Sorry!

22:35.020 --> 22:38.547
All that sleep you'll miss
wishing you were with me!

22:38.757 --> 22:41.191
Don't worry about me falling asleep.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.721
I still have your letter!

22:45.597 --> 22:48.430
Just so you know,
it's not that common.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.897
It doesn't happen to every guy.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.037
And it is a big deal!

22:53.905 --> 22:55.702
I knew it!

23:00.345 --> 23:01.505
Gin.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.972
We were playing gin?

23:07.052 --> 23:10.215
If we were a couple,
we could play naked.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.718
-Would you stop?
-Okay. All right.

23:14.993 --> 23:15.823
All right.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.722
I think you're great.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.826
I think you're sweet and smart...

23:21.400 --> 23:23.425
...and I love you.

23:24.436 --> 23:27.769
But you'll always be the guy
who peed on me.
