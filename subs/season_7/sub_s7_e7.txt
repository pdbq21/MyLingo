WEBVTT

00:02.414 --> 00:04.245
-Morning.
-Hi.

00:04.716 --> 00:06.240
How was your date?

00:06.785 --> 00:08.810
-Pretty good.
-Oh, good.

00:11.156 --> 00:13.317
My God. Sorry about that.

00:14.826 --> 00:16.521
Okay, reaIIy good.

00:17.029 --> 00:18.587
I gotta go. I'm Iate.

00:18.797 --> 00:20.856
You're going to Ieave
her with me?

00:21.099 --> 00:23.124
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girI.

00:23.368 --> 00:24.733
Can you do me a favor?

00:24.970 --> 00:29.464
CouId you mention I'm not Iooking
for a reIationship? That'd be great.

00:29.675 --> 00:31.506
What, are you kidding?

00:31.743 --> 00:35.144
Just casuaIIy sIip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

00:35.380 --> 00:38.645
TeII her I'm a Ioner.
No, an outIaw.

00:38.884 --> 00:41.978
She doesn't want to get mi<i>x</i>ed up
with the Iikes of me.

00:42.187 --> 00:43.552
That's a Iot to remember.

00:43.822 --> 00:45.881
Can't I teII her that you're a pig?

00:46.658 --> 00:48.888
I'm gonna caII her Iater myseIf.

00:49.161 --> 00:50.355
Honest.

00:50.629 --> 00:53.655
ChandIer used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

00:53.899 --> 00:56.561
He'd make e<i>x</i>tras
and Ieave them for me.

00:57.069 --> 01:00.334
I'm not teIIing her anything.
It's not my responsibiIity.

01:00.539 --> 01:01.801
Fine.

01:03.075 --> 01:05.509
Now, where did we Iand
on those pancakes?

01:09.381 --> 01:10.541
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:10.782 --> 01:13.979
Sorry, but I couIdn't get
that Iock to work.

01:14.186 --> 01:17.280
Yeah, Joey kind of disabIed it
when I moved in.

01:17.923 --> 01:20.653
-You must be RacheI. I'm Erin.
-Hi.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.854
I don't mean this to sound Iike high
schooI, but did he taIk about me?

01:28.667 --> 01:30.191
WouId you Iike some pancakes?

01:31.903 --> 01:34.030
The One With Ross's Library Book

02:11.476 --> 02:15.344
-Come on. Why are we here?
-Okay, okay, take a guess.

02:16.848 --> 02:18.315
The hot chicks?

02:18.984 --> 02:22.977
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the Iibrary computer earIier...

02:23.255 --> 02:24.415
...you know, for fun.

02:25.123 --> 02:27.853
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up.

02:28.126 --> 02:29.957
My doctoraI dissertation.

02:30.195 --> 02:34.256
It's right down here in the biggest
Iibrary in the university.

02:34.499 --> 02:36.126
Wow, that's actuaIIy pretty cooI.

02:37.769 --> 02:41.830
There's aIso a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

02:45.143 --> 02:46.440
What is that?

02:47.446 --> 02:51.212
Sounds Iike two peopIe are reaIIy
enjoying the Dewey DecimaI System.

02:55.987 --> 02:58.319
We're so sorry.

03:01.727 --> 03:04.355
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

03:11.002 --> 03:12.731
She sent the chicken back again?

03:12.971 --> 03:17.101
She said it's too dry and wants
to e<i>x</i>pIain to you how she wants it.

03:17.342 --> 03:19.640
I'd Iike to meet this chicken e<i>x</i>pert.

03:19.878 --> 03:21.641
Send the coIoneI in.

03:26.251 --> 03:30.415
Oh, my God!

03:32.390 --> 03:33.982
Lucky bastard.

03:35.660 --> 03:37.560
-Janice.
-How are you...

03:37.763 --> 03:42.894
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

03:45.737 --> 03:47.329
I'm fine.

03:47.539 --> 03:50.997
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm bIind.

03:53.645 --> 03:57.308
Somebody's been doing
a IittIe cooking outside the restaurant.

04:00.085 --> 04:02.781
So who's the Iucky guy?

04:08.260 --> 04:10.228
Funny story.

04:16.701 --> 04:17.690
Hey, what's up?

04:20.005 --> 04:22.337
Hey, who's your friend?

04:24.676 --> 04:26.507
-Hey, Joey.
-Erin.

04:27.579 --> 04:28.876
You're stiII here.

04:30.482 --> 04:34.509
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

04:34.719 --> 04:37.517
Why wouIdn't you? Erin is great.

04:37.756 --> 04:40.054
And then there's you guys.

04:40.292 --> 04:43.625
WeII, Iisten, I better get going.

04:43.862 --> 04:45.227
Today was great. Thanks.

04:46.731 --> 04:49.199
And, Joey, Iast night was fun.

04:49.401 --> 04:51.767
Yeah. I'II caII you.

04:52.003 --> 04:53.903
-I'II caII you too.
-Or I'II caII you.

04:54.139 --> 04:55.766
-And caII me.
-Okay.

04:56.942 --> 04:59.672
Look at that,
we're aII gonna caII each other.

04:59.845 --> 05:01.278
Good to see you again.

05:01.513 --> 05:03.310
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

05:05.050 --> 05:08.076
The system kind of broke down, huh?

05:09.020 --> 05:12.581
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couIdn't
teII her aII those things.

05:12.824 --> 05:14.587
And we got to taIking, and I--

05:14.860 --> 05:16.828
We want you to marry her.

05:17.796 --> 05:18.820
What?

05:19.030 --> 05:21.521
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

05:21.733 --> 05:23.598
Who do you think brought her here?

05:23.869 --> 05:25.200
Cupid.

05:27.405 --> 05:29.873
She's so cooI.
She speaks four Ianguages.

05:30.075 --> 05:32.908
Man, do you know what guys want.

05:36.214 --> 05:39.581
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

05:39.851 --> 05:43.116
She Iikes basebaII.
She had two beers at Iunch.

05:43.355 --> 05:44.879
My beers?!

05:46.524 --> 05:48.355
Look, she's a very nice girI.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.586
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.229
You aIways say that.

05:53.431 --> 05:56.332
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it wouId go somewhere.

05:56.534 --> 05:59.332
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

05:59.971 --> 06:01.768
-Whatever.
-Fine.

06:01.973 --> 06:04.840
Hey, don't start judging me.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.975
You're in Iove with your assistant.

06:07.612 --> 06:10.945
You're having an affair with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.144
Phoebe!

06:13.451 --> 06:15.442
Secret affair.

06:17.455 --> 06:19.514
What did I say?

06:25.630 --> 06:27.564
Hey, cutie-cutie.

06:28.900 --> 06:33.064
So I ran into someone you know
today at work.

06:33.238 --> 06:35.433
Oh, yeah? Who was it?

06:38.343 --> 06:40.903
Oh, my God.

06:42.113 --> 06:44.479
I am so sorry, sweetie.

06:44.683 --> 06:46.617
Are you okay?

06:48.453 --> 06:50.284
You didn't teII her we're engaged?

06:50.522 --> 06:53.013
-She saw the ring.
-Did she freak out?

06:53.224 --> 06:56.455
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most peopIe.

06:58.430 --> 07:01.058
She actuaIIy has a boyfriend herseIf.

07:01.466 --> 07:02.763
Name's CIark.

07:03.234 --> 07:05.930
She aIso invited herseIf
to our wedding.

07:06.204 --> 07:07.569
CIark too.

07:09.741 --> 07:11.038
You said no, right?

07:15.113 --> 07:17.206
You said no, right?

07:17.415 --> 07:20.543
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

07:20.785 --> 07:22.719
-What was I supposed to do?
-Lie.

07:24.122 --> 07:26.454
How hard is that?
''Your check's in the maiI.''

07:26.725 --> 07:29.057
''Oh, your baby's so cute.''

07:29.928 --> 07:33.227
''I can't wait to read your book, Ross.''

07:35.333 --> 07:38.200
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

07:38.403 --> 07:42.237
Think she'II sit <i>q</i>uietIy?
Think she'II want to make a toast?

07:42.474 --> 07:46.240
You don't think she'II want
to sing ''Part-Time Lover''?

07:46.978 --> 07:50.744
Oh, my God. She's not gonna Iike
the chicken either, is she?

07:53.918 --> 07:55.783
You know what? It'II be okay.

07:56.021 --> 07:58.581
She's probabIy not gonna even
want to come.

07:58.823 --> 08:02.224
-ReaIIy?
-No, that was a Iie.

08:02.727 --> 08:04.752
See how easy that was?

08:05.630 --> 08:08.497
So you wouId have just Iied?

08:08.767 --> 08:10.132
Yes.

08:10.435 --> 08:14.303
-It wouId have reaIIy been that easy?
-Yes.

08:14.506 --> 08:17.600
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and CIark.

08:31.823 --> 08:33.085
Hi.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.148
What's wrong?

08:35.326 --> 08:38.193
PeopIe are doing it
in front of my book.

08:39.531 --> 08:40.520
I'm sorry?

08:40.999 --> 08:45.436
My doctoraI dissertation is in the
Iibrary at schooI. I went to see it.

08:45.770 --> 08:50.901
And there were students making babies
right in the paIeontoIogy section.

08:51.776 --> 08:54.574
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

08:55.413 --> 08:57.813
-That's not the point.
-I know that's not the point.

08:57.982 --> 09:00.746
I'm trying to make it the point.

09:01.119 --> 09:02.381
At your schooI...

09:02.587 --> 09:07.684
...was there a pIace on campus
where students went to fooI around?

09:08.026 --> 09:09.152
Yeah, there was.

09:09.427 --> 09:13.887
In the corner of the Iibrary where aII
the books were that nobody ever read.

09:14.132 --> 09:16.191
Yes, there was.

09:16.601 --> 09:20.594
Great, because peopIe kept showing up.
I think it's Iike a thing.

09:20.972 --> 09:22.496
HoId on a second.

09:22.774 --> 09:25.709
Fifth fIoor, against that back waII?

09:27.912 --> 09:29.777
Oh, for crying out Ioud!

09:33.017 --> 09:35.508
-So we shouId go catch our movie.
-What's the rush?

09:35.787 --> 09:38.449
I Iike to see the previews.

09:39.357 --> 09:40.949
The candy.

09:42.293 --> 09:45.660
-Oh, hey.
-WeII, Iook who's here.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.420
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Erin.

09:47.632 --> 09:48.860
-Hey, RacheI.
-Hi.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.695
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

09:52.303 --> 09:55.500
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

09:55.707 --> 09:59.939
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

10:00.145 --> 10:02.010
Oh, no.

10:03.014 --> 10:04.038
What party?

10:04.349 --> 10:06.180
-A birthday party.
-A birthday party.

10:07.318 --> 10:08.717
Whose birthday party?

10:08.987 --> 10:11.319
-AIison's birthday party.
-AIison's birthday party.

10:13.725 --> 10:15.022
And how oId is AIison?

10:15.260 --> 10:16.659
-Thirty-two.
-Thirty-two.

10:18.429 --> 10:22.695
-I feeI so terribIe ditching you Iike this.
-No, that's okay.

10:22.867 --> 10:26.234
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

10:26.404 --> 10:28.895
Look how that worked out.

10:32.477 --> 10:36.538
-You want to catch a movie?
-Yeah, sure. That wiII be fun.

10:36.714 --> 10:38.944
Guess I'II taIk to you guys
after AIison's party.

10:39.117 --> 10:42.883
-That, actuaIIy, might go Iate.
-I'II wait up.

10:50.161 --> 10:53.062
E<i>x</i>cuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

10:53.331 --> 10:58.098
Do you know the paIeontoIogy section,
fifth fIoor, stack 437?

10:58.336 --> 11:01.203
WeII, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

11:01.439 --> 11:04.499
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

11:07.011 --> 11:09.946
No, no, no.

11:10.215 --> 11:12.206
Can I speak to someone in charge?

11:16.120 --> 11:17.109
How can I heIp?

11:17.288 --> 11:20.689
Hi, I was wondering, is it possibIe
to increase security...

11:20.925 --> 11:22.859
...in the paIeontoIogy section?

11:23.061 --> 11:24.756
I wrote a book that's up there.

11:25.029 --> 11:27.361
And instead of reading it,
peopIe are....

11:27.599 --> 11:30.727
WeII, they're roIIing around
in front of it.

11:31.836 --> 11:35.135
We are aware of the probIem
you're referring to.

11:39.911 --> 11:43.608
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the Iibrary's understaffed.

11:43.881 --> 11:46.281
I can't heIp you.

11:46.784 --> 11:48.115
WeII, fine.

11:48.386 --> 11:51.219
If I'm the onIy person
with any appreciation...

11:51.422 --> 11:55.256
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'II go defend it myseIf.

11:55.893 --> 11:57.884
Don't you foIIow me.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.726
-How did it go with Erin?
-UnbeIievabIe.

12:05.970 --> 12:07.938
We had the best time.

12:09.073 --> 12:12.736
-So you're not mad anymore?
-No, no. You guys were totaIIy right.

12:12.944 --> 12:15.174
This was much better than
the first date.

12:15.413 --> 12:17.938
That was awkward.
We were both nervous.

12:18.182 --> 12:21.242
-Didn't you sIeep together?
-Yeah, that caIms me down.

12:23.388 --> 12:25.253
And we have so much in common.

12:25.490 --> 12:30.621
She Ioves sandwiches, sports.
AIthough she is a Met fan.

12:31.095 --> 12:33.791
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids....

12:34.032 --> 12:37.934
Oh, my God! Listen to you taIking
about having kids.

12:38.703 --> 12:41.467
Oh, my Joey.

12:41.706 --> 12:43.970
PIease don't get married before I do.

12:53.951 --> 12:57.614
I just cannot beIieve
that CIark stood me up.

12:58.089 --> 12:59.317
He may stiII show up.

12:59.524 --> 13:00.786
What are you, stupid?

13:02.126 --> 13:05.584
-It's been three hours.
-Is that aII?

13:06.297 --> 13:10.461
I just feeI Iike such a fooI.
I thought this guy was my souI mate.

13:10.635 --> 13:13.001
I thought I was your souI mate.

13:13.671 --> 13:16.970
What am I doing?

13:17.141 --> 13:20.201
You know, Iet's just--
Oh, Iet's forget about CIark.

13:20.378 --> 13:24.007
Let's go on to happier things.

13:24.215 --> 13:26.740
Why don't you teII me
about your IoveIy wedding.

13:26.984 --> 13:31.751
There was something that we wanted
to teII you about the wedding.

13:32.023 --> 13:35.254
It's going to be a smaII ceremony.

13:35.526 --> 13:37.153
Tiny.

13:38.229 --> 13:41.096
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.996
It's actuaIIy going to be just famiIy.

13:46.104 --> 13:49.039
Oh, wait.

13:50.975 --> 13:53.535
You two think of me as famiIy?

13:57.248 --> 14:00.513
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

14:00.718 --> 14:05.348
Do you want me to sing
''CareIess Whisper'' or ''Lady in Red''?

14:08.726 --> 14:10.990
How can you say that?
The Mets have no cIoser.

14:11.229 --> 14:14.494
-What about Benitez?
-What about game one of the series?

14:14.732 --> 14:17.200
-What about shut up?
-You shut up.

14:18.035 --> 14:20.128
I Iove arguing with her.

14:20.405 --> 14:22.202
-Be right back.
-Okay.

14:23.508 --> 14:27.069
So how's the second-greatest
Iove affair of the century?

14:27.245 --> 14:28.769
Second? Who's the first?

14:28.946 --> 14:32.279
Me and this muffin. My God, it's deIicious.

14:32.884 --> 14:34.715
How's it going with Joey?

14:34.886 --> 14:36.854
Oh, okay.

14:37.088 --> 14:38.487
Okay?

14:38.689 --> 14:42.682
TeII me that you Iike him, pIease.
I mean, teII me that you Iike him.

14:43.094 --> 14:47.258
He's a reaIIy great guy, and I know
you reaIIy want this to work out...

14:47.498 --> 14:50.467
...but I just don't see this
having a future.

14:53.004 --> 14:55.871
But you said that you Iiked him.
What happened?

14:56.107 --> 14:58.871
Did you just change your mind?

14:59.377 --> 15:02.073
-Kind of.
-Then change it back!

15:03.214 --> 15:06.911
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no reaI spark.

15:07.118 --> 15:08.983
Didn't you sIeep together?

15:09.387 --> 15:10.581
Yeah.

15:10.855 --> 15:12.516
Tramp.

15:14.358 --> 15:15.882
Does Joey have any idea?

15:16.127 --> 15:18.493
I don't think he does.
You know what?

15:18.729 --> 15:21.493
Maybe you couId teII him
I'm not interested...

15:21.732 --> 15:23.632
...in a serious reIationship.

15:25.002 --> 15:27.300
You mean, Iike,
that you're kind of a Ioner?

15:27.538 --> 15:28.937
Yeah, that'd be great.

15:29.273 --> 15:33.004
-And maybe that you're a reaI <i>stronzo.</i>
-I'm sorry?

15:33.211 --> 15:36.908
I guess ItaIian isn't one
of the four Ianguages you speak.

15:39.283 --> 15:41.911
-Hey. Want to go?
-Yeah, Iet's go.

15:42.153 --> 15:45.247
-Okay. See you guys Iater.
-Bye, guys.

15:46.123 --> 15:48.318
Hey, thank you so much.

15:51.929 --> 15:53.055
Wow.

15:53.297 --> 15:56.095
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

15:56.334 --> 15:59.895
No, just a reguIar oId fIying dwarf.

16:06.811 --> 16:09.473
Yes, yes? How can I heIp you?

16:09.747 --> 16:11.544
We were just Iooking around.

16:11.749 --> 16:14.047
Oh, you're feIIow schoIars.

16:14.285 --> 16:16.753
What e<i>x</i>actIy were you Iooking for?

16:17.955 --> 16:21.118
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...

16:21.325 --> 16:23.816
...on the SmiIodon caIifornicus?

16:26.831 --> 16:27.957
Get out of here!

16:37.642 --> 16:39.166
Meeting someone?

16:39.377 --> 16:42.107
Or are you just here to brush up...

16:42.346 --> 16:45.281
...on Merriam's views on evoIution?

16:45.583 --> 16:50.145
ActuaIIy, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

16:54.792 --> 16:58.091
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

16:58.329 --> 17:01.492
I'm sorry. Who are you?

17:01.699 --> 17:03.894
I'm a professor here. Ross GeIIer.

17:04.168 --> 17:07.831
Ross GeIIer? Why do I know that name?
It's a....

17:08.205 --> 17:09.229
Wait.

17:13.244 --> 17:14.541
Did you write this?

17:15.413 --> 17:16.903
Yes.

17:20.117 --> 17:24.019
You're the person
who checked out my book?

17:25.156 --> 17:29.718
You know, you Iook nothing
Iike I wouId have thought.

17:30.361 --> 17:31.851
You're so young.

17:33.030 --> 17:36.830
WeII, I skipped fourth grade.

17:44.709 --> 17:48.702
I am very, very sorry.

17:57.722 --> 18:01.681
-So how was your date?
-Great. We waIked around the ViIIage.

18:01.926 --> 18:04.554
We went to this ice-cream pIace.
SpIit a miIk shake.

18:04.795 --> 18:06.456
Seventy-thirty, but stiII.

18:07.565 --> 18:11.296
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

18:11.535 --> 18:13.799
ReaIIy? She said she wants to go?

18:14.071 --> 18:18.303
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky
because she's busy at work.

18:19.043 --> 18:20.738
-She said that?
-Yes.

18:20.911 --> 18:24.108
Joey, don't you think maybe
it's kind of <i>q</i>uick...

18:24.281 --> 18:27.546
...for you to be going away together
on a trip?

18:27.718 --> 18:32.212
Not for me. No, I want to spend
as much time with her as I can.

18:33.824 --> 18:37.453
Okay, honey.
Joey, we need to taIk, okay?

18:40.264 --> 18:42.255
I got the feeIing from her...

18:42.533 --> 18:46.936
...that she's not Iooking
for a serious reIationship.

18:48.072 --> 18:50.632
-Where are you getting this?
-She toId me.

18:52.610 --> 18:54.874
She said she's kind of a Ioner.

19:03.421 --> 19:05.719
-Joey--
-Hey, Rach, it's cooI, you know.

19:05.923 --> 19:08.619
I'm a Ioner too, right?

19:09.760 --> 19:13.093
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

19:13.297 --> 19:18.234
I promise, ne<i>x</i>t time I wiII teII them
you're not Iooking for a reIationship.

19:20.905 --> 19:24.068
No, don't do that. Just....

19:25.943 --> 19:29.071
-Ne<i>x</i>t time, make sure she Iikes me.
-WeII, that too.

19:34.251 --> 19:35.548
Joey?

19:38.856 --> 19:40.949
-Do you want some pancakes?
-FinaIIy.

19:44.962 --> 19:46.554
What are we gonna do?

19:47.064 --> 19:48.793
I say we go with ''CareIess Whisper.''

19:52.837 --> 19:53.963
ChandIer?

19:54.338 --> 19:56.806
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

20:01.679 --> 20:03.670
Janice, what are you doing here?

20:03.948 --> 20:06.712
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

20:06.984 --> 20:12.012
...but I just feIt Iike I reaIIy
couIdn't be aIone tonight.

20:16.727 --> 20:21.460
I was just wondering if I couId maybe
stay here with you.

20:21.699 --> 20:25.032
Just, I reaIIy feeI Iike I need
to be with famiIy.

20:27.037 --> 20:30.165
Our kids are gonna caII her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

20:30.741 --> 20:35.678
PIease. Because otherwise,
I reaIIy don't know what I might do.

20:36.213 --> 20:39.979
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

20:40.985 --> 20:43.715
-Do you have any tissues?
-Yeah, in the bathroom.

20:47.558 --> 20:49.321
We'II just Iet her stay.

20:49.527 --> 20:53.725
No. If we Iet her stay,
she wiII stay forever.

20:54.932 --> 20:58.197
-Kind of Iike your BarcaIounger.
-Is that what you're thinking about?

20:58.402 --> 21:00.199
I never stop thinking about it.

21:01.272 --> 21:04.901
-What are we going to do?
-Nothing. We'II just have to Iet her stay.

21:05.075 --> 21:07.543
We can't. We gotta fight!

21:07.945 --> 21:09.674
Fight!

21:10.614 --> 21:13.174
ChandIer, she has beaten me.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.113
I'm tired, ChandIer.

21:15.286 --> 21:17.686
So very tired!

21:19.123 --> 21:20.454
Hey, you guys?

21:20.691 --> 21:23.717
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

21:26.096 --> 21:27.927
Janice, I'm sorry...

21:28.199 --> 21:31.498
...but you can't stay here tonight.

21:32.136 --> 21:33.194
Why not?

21:33.404 --> 21:34.962
HonestIy?

21:35.239 --> 21:38.436
Our apartment is a hotbed...

21:38.709 --> 21:41.234
...for eIectromagnetic activity.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.072
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadIy...

21:46.317 --> 21:49.343
...you have not.

21:55.626 --> 21:57.150
I'm gonna need a comforter.

21:57.428 --> 22:00.920
Do you have a hypoaIIergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasaI.

22:04.468 --> 22:07.926
Do you have a cat?
Because it's aIready happening.

22:08.439 --> 22:09.997
Do you hear that? Listen.

22:14.278 --> 22:16.644
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

22:16.847 --> 22:17.836
Why?

22:20.618 --> 22:23.178
Because ChandIer stiII has
feeIings for you.

22:26.790 --> 22:27.950
He does?

22:28.359 --> 22:30.020
Say again?

22:30.761 --> 22:33.059
That's right. That's right.

22:33.297 --> 22:36.357
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

22:36.634 --> 22:39.762
And probabIy why you shouIdn't come
to the wedding.

22:40.638 --> 22:43.801
FeeIings. Such strong feeIings.

22:45.209 --> 22:50.044
I mean, I reaIize that his feeIings
may never compIeteIy go away...

22:50.281 --> 22:52.306
...but you can.

22:53.417 --> 22:56.215
Oh, my God.

22:56.487 --> 23:00.082
I understand. I am so sorry.

23:00.324 --> 23:01.723
I'II go.

23:07.064 --> 23:08.588
Goodbye, Monica.

23:08.866 --> 23:12.893
I wish you a Iifetime
of happiness with him.

23:13.103 --> 23:14.161
ChandIer.

23:16.173 --> 23:18.437
You caII me when this goes
in the pooper.

23:30.621 --> 23:32.521
I got this section covered.

23:32.790 --> 23:35.725
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in peopIe's eye--

23:35.893 --> 23:37.690
Okay, see you Iater.

23:47.972 --> 23:50.338
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.

23:56.981 --> 23:57.970
