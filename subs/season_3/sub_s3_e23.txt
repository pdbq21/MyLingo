Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a little baby?

00:06.548 --> 00:08.674
We could call it Chuck.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.392
Listen, I need a favor.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.729
I was in the shower, and as I was...

00:21.896 --> 00:25.482
...cleansing myself, I, uh...
Well, I felt something.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.861
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

00:29.863 --> 00:33.157
No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.992
Well, what was it?

00:35.160 --> 00:38.954
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not...

00:39.122 --> 00:43.208
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys...

00:43.376 --> 00:44.626

Huh.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.221
Well, what is it? Is it a mole?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.851
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.228
Ew. Is it...? What, a pimple?

01:06.483 --> 01:08.150
No, it's...

Okay, well, it's definite.

- Yeah, right.
- Ah.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.387
And, um, this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.556

- Vince is a fireman.

Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building before?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.569
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

Well, you know, if Joey and I
play with matches...

02:35.905 --> 02:37.823
...we could get you up to an even 100.

- Ha, ha. Oh.

You're right. I know.

Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight.
Ahem.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.223
Well, Pheebs?

Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field, you know?

I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?

You know, this kind of, like, you know,

So, Pheebs, do they know
about each other?

Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

03:27.665 --> 03:29.666
Okay, no, they don't know.

JOEY: Well?
- How'd it go at the doctor's?

03:38.426 --> 03:42.304
Well, he said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.806
- Well, what is it?
- He couldn't even tell me.

03:44.974 --> 03:50.604
He said it was just
some sort of skin abnormality.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.441
And the worse thing is, he said
not being able to identify it...

03:54.609 --> 03:56.360
...he was reluctant to remove it.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.278
You know what?
You should go to my guy.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.864
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple...

04:01.950 --> 04:04.201
...he just lopped it right off, you know?
- Yeah?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.328
- So I guess I'm lucky.
- Heh.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.540
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.878
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.590
Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.843
You know? They'd call it The Ross.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.555
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross."

04:27.308 --> 04:29.309
Yeah, that'd be cool.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.938

04:34.440 --> 04:36.358
Yeah, I just checked my messages.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.945
He said that when he gets back
from Atlanta, "We need to talk."

04:40.363 --> 04:41.863
- And?
MONICA: Well, that's it.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.409
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.495
Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.997
PHOEBE: Yeah.
- Really?

04:50.164 --> 04:52.833
Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.675
And I know I'll never get rich doing it,
but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...

a difference in a kid's life.

- No. No.

- No, no?
