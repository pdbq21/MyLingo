WEBVTT

00:10.290 --> 00:14.090
'Cause every time I see your face

00:14.695 --> 00:18.290
I can't help but fall from grace

00:18.532 --> 00:20.022
This girl's good.

00:20.267 --> 00:24.033
Yeah, a song with rhyming words!
I never thought of that before.

00:26.373 --> 00:27.362
I like her.

00:27.607 --> 00:31.873
Why? Because she can both sing
and play guitar at the same time?

00:32.879 --> 00:35.643
That's all I'm looking for
from these people.

00:36.483 --> 00:38.417
Look at you, all jealous.

00:38.652 --> 00:41.883
Come on, Pheebs. You two have
completely different styles.

00:42.122 --> 00:44.750
She's more...
You know?

00:46.460 --> 00:47.950
And you're more...

00:49.396 --> 00:52.957
Say you'll stay beside me

00:58.438 --> 01:01.134
See? Everybody else is
happy she's done.

01:03.777 --> 01:05.642
Okay, my next song's called:

01:05.912 --> 01:08.972
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Loved When We Were...

01:09.249 --> 01:12.514
...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way."

01:15.489 --> 01:18.481
One of those "look for
the hidden meaning" songs.

01:22.396 --> 01:24.296
The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner

02:08.375 --> 02:09.899
Hey, Phoebe.

02:10.076 --> 02:11.202
Hey, Leslie.

02:11.378 --> 02:12.845
How'd you know I'd be here?

02:13.079 --> 02:15.912
I saw Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish.

02:16.116 --> 02:17.879
He said you played here a lot, so...

02:18.218 --> 02:19.776
I have to go to the bathroom.

02:20.020 --> 02:22.011
If "big-fish place"
comes up again...

02:22.222 --> 02:26.283
...I'd like to know if that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.461
So Phoebe says you write jingles.

02:29.729 --> 02:32.527
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

02:34.634 --> 02:36.261
Anything we might've heard of?

02:38.605 --> 02:40.664
Home is never far away

02:40.874 --> 02:45.072
Home is Homestar Stew.

02:46.379 --> 02:49.280
But I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

02:49.616 --> 02:54.110
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

02:54.387 --> 02:55.445
Bummer.

02:57.123 --> 02:59.557
Well, you know, I was just...

02:59.826 --> 03:03.193
I was just thinking
and just hoping that...

03:04.164 --> 03:06.496
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.531
No, but, thanks.

03:08.735 --> 03:11.135
Come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

03:13.907 --> 03:15.374
No, but, thanks.

03:21.414 --> 03:22.881
See you, Pheebs.

03:27.053 --> 03:28.315
That was kind of brutal.

03:28.922 --> 03:31.220
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

03:31.491 --> 03:34.824
Once you betray me,
I become like the Ice Woman.

03:35.028 --> 03:39.931
I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

03:40.133 --> 03:43.591
You know, nothing can
penetrate this icy exterior.

03:43.803 --> 03:45.168
Can I have a tissue?

03:52.112 --> 03:53.704
Is someone in there?

03:55.382 --> 03:57.077
I'm playing a daredevil game...

03:57.350 --> 04:00.751
...called "Wait Until the Last Moment
Before I Burst and Die."

04:01.321 --> 04:02.720
Jeez, man! Did you fall...?

04:02.923 --> 04:03.912
Hi!

04:05.091 --> 04:08.026
So did you?
Did you fall high?

04:09.162 --> 04:11.255
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

04:11.531 --> 04:13.590
I left the lid up for you, though.

04:15.902 --> 04:17.927
You know what, Gunther?
Go ahead.

04:18.204 --> 04:20.195
I'm talking to...

04:22.075 --> 04:23.838
This is where you say your name.

04:24.010 --> 04:25.034
Ginger.

04:25.245 --> 04:27.679
Ginger.
I'm talking to Ginger, so...

04:31.284 --> 04:33.377
Don't you have to use the bathroom?

04:35.121 --> 04:37.453
No, I just...
I'd rather talk to you.

04:38.592 --> 04:40.583
Yes, I do.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.887
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

04:43.763 --> 04:45.628
There's someone in here.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.359
- Where's Chandler?
- He can't make it.

04:49.569 --> 04:52.231
He said he had to go back
to his job and...

04:55.075 --> 04:56.872
Joey?

04:58.211 --> 04:59.439
Joey Tribbiani?

05:05.485 --> 05:07.316
I can see you, okay?

05:07.554 --> 05:09.613
You're hiding behind the coats.

05:20.834 --> 05:21.926
Close one.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.275
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

05:30.510 --> 05:33.172
- Hello.
- Hey, Ross.

05:36.516 --> 05:38.575
- I've got some bad news.
- What?

05:38.852 --> 05:41.150
I can eat,
but I have to come back here.

05:41.354 --> 05:44.414
Come on. You've worked late
every night for two weeks.

05:44.658 --> 05:47.456
- What is it now?
- It's my fault. I quit today.

05:47.661 --> 05:49.595
But work comes first!

05:50.030 --> 05:53.124
But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

05:53.366 --> 05:56.858
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

05:58.872 --> 06:00.965
He's leaving for a better job.

06:01.207 --> 06:04.267
That's great.
So I guess this is goodbye then.

06:04.511 --> 06:05.535
Goodbye.

06:08.114 --> 06:09.103
Okay, then.

06:09.949 --> 06:12.179
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

06:12.652 --> 06:13.641
Yeah, me too.

06:16.723 --> 06:19.487
- So see you on Saturday.
- Yeah, you bet!

06:38.978 --> 06:41.538
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in India.

06:43.149 --> 06:46.641
That was Leslie calling
to see if we can get back together.

06:46.886 --> 06:50.982
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

06:52.325 --> 06:53.815
She must've hurt you bad.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.858
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

06:57.097 --> 07:00.760
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

07:01.901 --> 07:04.699
You two must've been so cute,
running around on a barge.

07:04.904 --> 07:07.031
You never run on a barge!

07:11.511 --> 07:13.103
Is Chandler around?

07:13.379 --> 07:15.711
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

07:16.449 --> 07:17.507
Ginger something.

07:21.354 --> 07:25.848
Sure it wasn't something that sounded
liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?

07:27.460 --> 07:28.722
No, it was Ginger.

07:28.962 --> 07:31.055
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

07:31.364 --> 07:33.525
The movie star

07:34.701 --> 07:37.795
Oh, man!
That's the girl I was hiding from.

07:38.071 --> 07:40.699
When she sees he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

07:40.907 --> 07:44.274
- What did you do?
- Oh, no! I can't...

07:45.612 --> 07:49.776
I can't tell you. It's the
most awful thing I've ever done.

07:49.949 --> 07:53.680
You're really not making us
want to hear it less.

07:53.853 --> 07:55.013
Don't tell us.

07:55.288 --> 07:58.849
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.
It'll be more fun that way.

08:00.827 --> 08:03.489
It was, like, four years ago.

08:03.763 --> 08:06.732
Ginger and I had gone out a few times.
Then one weekend...

08:06.900 --> 08:08.424
...we went to her Dad's cabin...

08:08.635 --> 08:12.503
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper.

08:12.739 --> 08:15.799
That night I cooked
this really romantic dinner...

08:16.009 --> 08:17.909
You gave her food poisoning!

08:18.378 --> 08:19.367
I wish.

08:20.713 --> 08:24.513
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
fell asleep in front of the fire.

08:24.884 --> 08:29.218
I woke up in the middle of the night
and saw the fire was dying out...

08:29.556 --> 08:32.081
...so I picked up a log
and threw it on.

08:34.127 --> 08:35.958
Or what I thought was a log.

08:36.162 --> 08:38.722
Oh, my God!
You threw Pepper on the fire!

08:39.666 --> 08:40.724
I wish.

08:43.136 --> 08:46.731
Another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger...

08:46.940 --> 08:49.272
...is that she kind of has a...

08:49.976 --> 08:51.068
...artificial leg.

08:57.183 --> 08:58.673
Oh, my God!

09:00.186 --> 09:02.347
You threw it on the fire?

09:02.522 --> 09:04.786
She must've freaked out.

09:05.391 --> 09:07.882
Yeah, she must've.

09:09.662 --> 09:12.426
- You don't know?
- Well...

09:12.599 --> 09:16.592
What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

09:17.036 --> 09:18.025
I ran!

09:19.772 --> 09:23.139
- You ran?
- Through the woods, with no socks on.

09:33.286 --> 09:35.345
That's the best kiss I've had...

09:35.555 --> 09:38.046
...with anybody I met
in a men's room.

09:39.158 --> 09:40.284
Actually, me too.

09:42.395 --> 09:44.454
Foot all in the puddle!

09:44.697 --> 09:46.528
Damn! I hate that!

09:46.733 --> 09:49.793
- You'll have to get out of those shoes.
- Don't worry.

09:50.069 --> 09:51.900
No, really.
You're gonna freeze.

09:52.138 --> 09:53.469
No, I'm not.

09:55.909 --> 09:58.707
You're not?
Have you got a bionic foot?

09:59.913 --> 10:01.676
Someday. Maybe.

10:12.592 --> 10:13.752
Funny book?

10:15.728 --> 10:19.164
I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.568
Mark saying,
"I'll see you Saturday."

10:25.705 --> 10:27.036
Yeah, at the lecture.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.107
I told you last week.
You said you didn't mind.

10:30.376 --> 10:33.209
It's not the lecture I mind.

10:34.247 --> 10:37.512
Please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

10:38.251 --> 10:40.014
- Well...
- Oh, my God!

10:40.954 --> 10:44.287
I'm sorry, but if you're not
working with him anymore...

10:44.524 --> 10:46.458
...why do you still hang out?

10:46.726 --> 10:48.387
Because he's my friend.

10:49.062 --> 10:52.122
But do you really need
another "friend"?

10:54.600 --> 10:58.400
If I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

10:58.938 --> 11:01.566
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

11:01.774 --> 11:05.437
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

11:06.079 --> 11:07.376
Mark is in fashion.

11:07.647 --> 11:10.639
I like having a friend
I can share this stuff with.

11:10.883 --> 11:14.046
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

11:16.389 --> 11:18.949
- I'd love to go with you.
- Really?

11:19.425 --> 11:21.120
I have clothes.

11:21.394 --> 11:22.793
I even pick them out.

11:23.062 --> 11:26.554
For all you know,
I could be a fashion...

11:27.300 --> 11:28.324
...monger.

11:33.906 --> 11:36.306
I would love for you to go with me.

11:36.909 --> 11:38.240
What?

11:38.678 --> 11:41.146
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

11:51.190 --> 11:54.523
You know, they say
"A watched pot never beeps."

11:57.597 --> 11:59.462
It's been a couple hours...

12:00.299 --> 12:01.994
...and she hasn't called.

12:02.835 --> 12:04.860
Not that I even care. I don't.

12:05.705 --> 12:07.639
Why don't you just call her?

12:07.874 --> 12:09.865
You obviously want to.

12:10.143 --> 12:12.168
You think you know me so well.

12:12.512 --> 12:14.104
Well, don't you wanna?

12:16.616 --> 12:18.140
So I do know you.

12:18.451 --> 12:19.884
That's what I said.

12:22.188 --> 12:24.679
- Well, so?
- I can't.

12:25.191 --> 12:27.386
I can't. She dumped me.

12:27.693 --> 12:30.093
I totally trusted her,
then one day it was like:

12:30.296 --> 12:32.355
"Okay, bye, Pheebs."
Gone!

12:34.033 --> 12:36.194
You know what the saddest part is?

12:36.502 --> 12:38.868
When we were playing together,
that was...

12:39.138 --> 12:42.198
...the most fun I've ever had
in all my lives.

12:44.243 --> 12:49.078
My favorite shoes, so good to me
I wear them every day

12:49.348 --> 12:54.308
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say

12:54.554 --> 12:57.352
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

12:57.590 --> 13:00.184
With them, I'm one hot chickie

13:00.493 --> 13:03.860
Though late one night
Not much light

13:04.063 --> 13:07.658
I stepped in something icky

13:10.503 --> 13:13.199
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

13:13.439 --> 13:15.999
Always make me smile

13:16.209 --> 13:21.272
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll...

13:22.281 --> 13:25.114
...avoid the...

13:25.384 --> 13:27.079
...pile!

13:33.659 --> 13:38.153
We're beginning to see a lot of
layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

13:38.431 --> 13:41.696
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink...

13:41.934 --> 13:44.368
I'm really glad we came.

13:49.408 --> 13:51.740
You're so pretty.

13:53.846 --> 13:55.211
I love you.

13:58.885 --> 14:01.786
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:01.988 --> 14:04.718
What are they feeding you?

14:04.991 --> 14:08.222
Smelly cat, smelly cat

14:08.494 --> 14:11.190
It's not your fault

14:13.833 --> 14:15.357
- That's great!
- Yeah?

14:15.535 --> 14:17.730
You know, you could totally sell this.

14:17.970 --> 14:21.906
It'd be perfect for, like,
a kitty-litter campaign.

14:22.742 --> 14:24.642
A jingle?

14:25.211 --> 14:26.803
Why not?
You'd make a ton of money.

14:27.046 --> 14:30.504
If I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now.

14:32.251 --> 14:34.651
You gotta get out of
that jingle-head.

14:36.222 --> 14:38.417
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

14:38.658 --> 14:39.647
That's okay.

14:39.825 --> 14:42.988
I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

14:43.196 --> 14:46.097
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."

14:51.437 --> 14:54.065
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

14:54.340 --> 14:58.367
...oversizing of accessories,
in general, is very popular now.

15:10.923 --> 15:13.221
Can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

15:13.459 --> 15:14.448
I hate that.

15:14.727 --> 15:17.958
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

15:20.366 --> 15:22.926
So how was your date with Ginger?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.601
Great.

15:25.771 --> 15:27.295
It was great. She's...

15:27.573 --> 15:30.474
She's great. Great looks
and personality. Greatness.

15:32.645 --> 15:34.704
Sounds like she's got the...

15:35.214 --> 15:36.647
...whole package.

15:40.152 --> 15:42.518
So she's got it all, huh?

15:42.955 --> 15:45.116
She's the real deal?

15:45.992 --> 15:48.324
Joey told you about the leg, huh?

15:50.162 --> 15:52.096
Oh, God!
It freaked me out.

15:52.331 --> 15:53.958
It shouldn't, but it did.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.726
I wanna keep seeing her,
but it's like:

15:57.003 --> 15:59.403
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

16:04.010 --> 16:07.741
I'm the smallest person in the world,
aren't I?

16:07.980 --> 16:09.277
Morning.

16:09.448 --> 16:12.315
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

16:18.257 --> 16:20.282
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

16:22.928 --> 16:24.122
It came up.

16:25.331 --> 16:27.765
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but...

16:29.335 --> 16:32.133
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

16:36.809 --> 16:38.436
So I nodded off a little!

16:38.678 --> 16:41.670
"Nodded off"?
Ross, you were snoring!

16:41.947 --> 16:46.077
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks!

16:46.285 --> 16:48.719
Come on! Forty-five minutes...

16:48.888 --> 16:53.018
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

16:54.226 --> 16:58.720
Okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

16:58.998 --> 17:01.228
...listening to
Professor "Pitstains" say:

17:01.500 --> 17:04.833
"Remember that thing that died
a gazillion years ago?

17:05.104 --> 17:08.403
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had!"

17:11.844 --> 17:15.780
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

17:16.382 --> 17:18.907
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

17:19.118 --> 17:22.519
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

17:22.722 --> 17:24.849
Okay, you know what I just heard?

17:29.695 --> 17:34.029
A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

17:34.233 --> 17:38.761
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

17:39.071 --> 17:41.062
Oh, that is so...

17:41.273 --> 17:45.801
A bunch of out-of-control jackets
take over an island!

17:52.118 --> 17:54.279
If what I do is so lame...

17:54.487 --> 17:58.116
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

17:58.391 --> 18:01.258
Was it so I just wouldn't
go with Mark?

18:03.629 --> 18:05.824
I wanted to be with you.

18:06.632 --> 18:08.759
I don't know, I feel like lately...

18:09.001 --> 18:10.969
...you're slipping away from me...

18:11.170 --> 18:13.638
...with this new job
and all these new people.

18:13.839 --> 18:16.603
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

18:16.809 --> 18:18.777
I know it's dumb...

18:19.011 --> 18:23.107
...but I just hate
that I'm not a part of it.

18:27.586 --> 18:29.019
It's not dumb.

18:30.689 --> 18:33.783
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

18:34.026 --> 18:35.254
You know what I mean?

18:36.796 --> 18:37.922
I mean, it's like...

18:38.130 --> 18:42.328
...I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

18:43.135 --> 18:44.830
That's a little clearer.

18:46.138 --> 18:48.834
See, it doesn't mean
I don't love you...

18:49.141 --> 18:52.269
...because I do.
I love you so much.

18:52.511 --> 18:54.877
But my work...
It's for me, you know?

18:55.181 --> 18:57.615
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

18:57.850 --> 19:01.946
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

19:02.822 --> 19:04.847
But I mean, is that okay?

19:05.291 --> 19:06.485
Sure.

19:16.635 --> 19:18.569
You're thinking about my leg.

19:20.739 --> 19:23.572
Actually, I forgot.
What's the deal with that again?

19:23.809 --> 19:26.642
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

19:26.846 --> 19:29.713
I only need to know
how much it bothers you...

19:29.915 --> 19:32.179
...because I don't like
wasting my time.

19:33.052 --> 19:34.417
Am I wasting my time?

19:36.155 --> 19:37.850
No, I don't think so.

19:39.058 --> 19:42.391
It's like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

19:54.907 --> 19:56.966
What's that?

19:57.276 --> 19:59.073
That's my "nubbin."

20:03.916 --> 20:05.349
What's a nubbin?

20:06.585 --> 20:10.544
It's kind of a third-nipple
kind of thing.

20:12.191 --> 20:13.715
You have three nipples?

20:13.926 --> 20:15.951
Well, you know, two regulars...

20:16.595 --> 20:19.962
...and one that
barely qualifies as a...

20:23.135 --> 20:25.467
- What?
- Nothing. You know, I...

20:25.771 --> 20:27.898
I just remembered.
I have to leave.

20:28.140 --> 20:31.541
You have to leave? Now? How come?

20:31.744 --> 20:33.541
Well, it's nubbin.
Nothing!

20:35.514 --> 20:38.847
You know what?
I'll see you later.

20:47.359 --> 20:48.792
I thought you weren't coming.

20:49.328 --> 20:51.455
- Where were you?
- Come here, come here.

20:53.365 --> 20:54.525
Don't get mad, okay?

20:54.767 --> 20:57.497
Don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

20:58.170 --> 21:02.129
I played Smelly Cat for
my old ad agency. They went nuts!

21:02.341 --> 21:05.674
I told you I didn't want you
to try and sell it...

21:05.945 --> 21:09.210
...and you just big, fat did it anyway!

21:10.950 --> 21:14.784
I think, five years ago,
I probably would have done anything...

21:14.987 --> 21:16.386
...to play with you.

21:16.622 --> 21:20.023
But I can do it myself.
If I can't trust you, then forget it.

21:20.492 --> 21:21.982
I don't wanna forget it.

21:22.194 --> 21:23.957
You know what?
You have to choose.

21:24.163 --> 21:27.326
If the most important thing
on the planet to you...

21:27.533 --> 21:32.664
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then you can have Smelly Cat.

21:32.871 --> 21:34.839
But we won't be partners.

21:35.474 --> 21:36.941
So, what's it gonna be?

21:37.142 --> 21:40.441
- Smelly cat, smelly cat
- Problem odor in the litter box?

21:40.646 --> 21:43.979
Don't change your kitty,
change your kitty litter.

21:44.383 --> 21:46.715
It's not your fault

21:49.455 --> 21:51.980
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Yeah.

21:52.157 --> 21:53.419
You okay?

21:55.027 --> 21:56.358
I actually am.

21:56.595 --> 22:00.258
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

22:00.566 --> 22:03.535
You learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

22:04.703 --> 22:07.365
- You wanna hear a new song?
- We'd love to.

22:10.142 --> 22:11.837
Jingle bitch screwed me over

22:14.013 --> 22:15.640
Go to hell, jingle whore

22:15.881 --> 22:19.874
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

22:20.552 --> 22:22.611
That's all I have so far.

22:26.492 --> 22:27.959
Well, hello!

22:29.094 --> 22:30.891
- Where you been?
- The doctor.

22:31.096 --> 22:32.495
Is everything okay?

22:32.765 --> 22:35.233
Just had me
a little nubbin-ectomy.

22:38.937 --> 22:40.666
Two nipples, no waiting.

22:40.873 --> 22:44.274
Well! Just like Rachel
in high school.

22:45.611 --> 22:46.600
What?

22:47.479 --> 22:50.642
Come on, I was kidding!
It was such an obvious joke.

22:50.849 --> 22:52.680
That was an obvious joke.

22:52.951 --> 22:54.942
And I didn't think of it. Why?

22:56.188 --> 22:58.213
The source of all my powers.

22:59.958 --> 23:02.426
Oh, dear God, what have I done?

23:02.594 --> 23:03.583
