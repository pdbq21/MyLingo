WEBVTT

00:03.803 --> 00:05.361
We are so in luck!

00:05.572 --> 00:08.132
Treeger said we could have
all this cool stuff!

00:08.608 --> 00:09.734
Wait right there.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.809
Oh, no. I'm paddling away.

00:16.383 --> 00:19.318
Really? We got all this
rusty crap for free?

00:21.454 --> 00:26.050
This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
And some of it is not even popped.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.060
Could we be more white trash?

00:37.904 --> 00:39.963
The One with the Cuffs

01:25.218 --> 01:26.879
How desperate am l?

01:27.487 --> 01:31.423
Good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.919
I just told my mom
I'd cater her party.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.391
-How come?
-I need the money.

01:36.663 --> 01:41.293
It'd be a great way to get rid of
that last smidgen of self-respect.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.230
I think this is a good thing.

01:43.470 --> 01:47.304
Mom wouldn't have hired you
if you weren't good.

01:47.574 --> 01:51.510
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.479
Do you have any juice?

01:55.748 --> 01:56.976
Just pickle.

01:58.885 --> 02:02.252
Funny story.
I bumped into Joanna yesterday.

02:03.389 --> 02:06.017
My boss, Joanna?
That must have been awkward.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.854
Actually, she asked me
if I wanted a drink.

02:10.697 --> 02:13.598
You didn't say yes to that,
did you?

02:17.170 --> 02:18.535
Hello, Rachel.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.533
Well, not at first.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.743
What is she doing here?

02:33.653 --> 02:37.089
Last time you went out with her
you said she was a dud!

02:37.323 --> 02:42.124
I judged her too quickly.
This time, we took it to the next level.

02:45.398 --> 02:49.892
Last time I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.263
It's not an everyday occurrence!

02:52.505 --> 02:54.996
Usually I'm in there by myself.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.075
Promise.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.384
-Rachel, aren't you running late?
-No

03:05.552 --> 03:08.680
-You are if you pick me up a bagel.
-Okay.

03:09.589 --> 03:12.183
Promise you will end this now.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.324
-I promise. I'll end it.
-Thank you.

03:16.563 --> 03:18.656
I hope you know what I'm giving up.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.562
She's not just the boss in your office.
You know what I mean?

03:27.073 --> 03:28.938
Sorry.
I knew what he meant.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.008
How's the hired help?

03:36.549 --> 03:38.881
Doing great.
Quiches are coming along.

03:39.185 --> 03:41.176
What's this?
Blue nail polish?

03:42.455 --> 03:44.184
I thought it was cute.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.622
It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.262
Let me ask you a question.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.627
Why did you hire me?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.798
Richard raved about
the food at his party...

03:58.037 --> 03:59.732
...but you were sleeping with him.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.272
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was nice.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.374
I assume you didn't sleep
with anyone there.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.877
At least that would be something.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.251
Oh, my God!
Did you hear that?

04:13.653 --> 04:16.144
She hired me because
she thinks I'm good.

04:18.791 --> 04:19.917
I didn't hear that.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.557
She didn't hire me out of pity.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.995
It wasn't so she could pick on me.
She actually thinks I'm good.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.803
And hey, it's cool
if you're a lesbian.

04:47.186 --> 04:50.815
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?

04:56.663 --> 04:59.826
Do you currently own
a set of encyclopedias?

05:00.033 --> 05:03.969
No, but try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.

05:04.203 --> 05:07.070
Actually, I'm not buying.
I'm selling.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.173
Let me ask you one question.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.167
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...

05:12.378 --> 05:16.838
...and you just nod along,
not sure what they're talking about?

05:22.021 --> 05:25.354
I'm telling you,
it's totally unconstitutional.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.892
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.696
It was like the
Algonquin kids' table.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.364
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.668
You haven't said anything
for about two minutes.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.506
Are you at all interested?

05:50.316 --> 05:51.510
Come on in.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.552
-That's weird.
-What?

05:56.889 --> 05:57.821
Your nails.

05:58.024 --> 06:02.552
I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't
give me grief about biting them.

06:02.829 --> 06:06.356
I meant, it's weird that
you only have nine now.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.266
Oh, my God!

06:11.604 --> 06:12.832
Wait a minute.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.662
I had them when I put

06:15.108 --> 06:16.939
Oh, my God!
It's in the quiche!

06:18.244 --> 06:20.235
-Oh, my God!
-Okay, don't panic.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.538
I'll go buy you a new set of nails.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.240
No one will know,
and you'll look great!

06:27.387 --> 06:30.879
It's because they're going to eat
That's the problem.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.358
Honey, don't bite your nails.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.092
Please don't freak out.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.432
There's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.137
And there's no way to know which one.

06:48.474 --> 06:51.773
And whoever finds it wins the prize!

06:53.146 --> 06:54.511
I'm not freaking out.

06:54.714 --> 06:58.616
-Why are you laughing?
-Now your father owes me $5.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.783
You bet I'd lose a nail?

07:00.987 --> 07:04.252
Don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.319
Frozen lasagnas?

07:08.227 --> 07:10.127
You bet that I'd screw up?

07:10.663 --> 07:13.257
All that stuff about how I was good

07:13.466 --> 07:14.899
No, that was all true.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.797
This was just in case
you "pulled a Monica."

07:18.571 --> 07:21.972
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.173
Come on.
Have a sense of humor.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.810
You're never able to
laugh at yourself.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.273
That's right.

07:29.415 --> 07:32.145
My mom has no faith in me!
That's hilarious!

07:34.587 --> 07:35.781
I don't get it.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.286
No. I have faith.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.289
No. You have lasagnas!

07:48.801 --> 07:50.598
The ruined quiches are ready!

07:59.645 --> 08:03.206
-I really don't think we should be doing this.
-Okay.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.314
It just doesn't feel like
we're breaking up.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.221
No, we are.
I'm sad.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.864
Can you wait till tomorrow?
All right.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.732
Unbelievable!

08:28.040 --> 08:29.234
Thanks.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.669
That was my boss.
I have to go.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.007
What are you doing?

08:36.249 --> 08:38.046
-I'm getting dressed.
-Why?

08:38.618 --> 08:41.610
When I walk outside naked,
people throw garbage.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.913
Wait.
I want to show you something.

08:45.591 --> 08:46.580
What is it?

08:47.093 --> 08:49.721
Just a little gag gift
somebody gave me.

08:50.229 --> 08:51.856
Put your hands together.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.229
You're not the boss of me.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.731
Yeah, you are.

09:02.441 --> 09:03.601
Saucy!

09:09.315 --> 09:11.215
I'll be back in two minutes.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.813
You're going to leave me like this?

09:14.987 --> 09:19.151
Knowing you're here waiting for me.
I think it's exciting, don't you?

09:19.759 --> 09:22.057
If you don't come back soon...

09:22.495 --> 09:25.396
...there's pretty much
nothing I can do about it!

09:29.001 --> 09:30.866
I brought you back a macaroon.

09:31.103 --> 09:34.072
Great. I'll keep it in
my butt with your nose.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.077
That's weird.
She locked the door.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.341
You know why? She's got
the bonus list in there.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.349
I saw her working on it today.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.788
Swear you won't tell.

09:51.023 --> 09:54.015
When Mark left, he gave me
a key to her office.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.989
You want to see the list?

10:10.576 --> 10:11.668
How are you?

10:34.634 --> 10:38.126
Hello, Joanna

10:38.270 --> 10:40.670
office.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.939
I'm sorry.
I'll be a little longer.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.668
-How little?
-A couple hours.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.278
This isn't funny.
Get back here now!

10:49.482 --> 10:50.642
-I can't!
-Why not?

10:50.850 --> 10:52.681
I'm in my boss' car.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.613
-What?
-Tunnel!

11:12.371 --> 11:13.360
What?

11:13.606 --> 11:16.268
Rachel, could I see you
for a moment?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.641
Okay, here's the situation.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.784
The keys to the cuffs
are on the door.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.216
Could you be a doll...

11:30.456 --> 11:33.789
...and grab them and
scoot on over here and unlock me?

11:35.094 --> 11:38.757
And on a totally separate subject,
that's a lovely pantsuit.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.194
You promised you would
break up with her.

11:44.336 --> 11:48.500
I did break up with her!
She just took it really, really well!

11:50.710 --> 11:54.202
Jeopardizing my career
never entered your mind?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.879
It did enter my mind.

11:56.082 --> 12:00.075
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.

12:01.587 --> 12:05.353
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.725
I can't get myself right out of them.

12:09.995 --> 12:13.726
You must have me confused with
the "Amazing Chandler"!

12:14.033 --> 12:18.265
Unlock me! She could be gone
for hours, and I'm cold and....

12:22.174 --> 12:23.436
All right! This is it!

12:23.709 --> 12:25.336
Never see her again.

12:25.711 --> 12:26.735
Never!

12:27.012 --> 12:29.845
-Never come in here again.
-Fine!

12:30.249 --> 12:32.183
Give me back my Walkman!

12:34.420 --> 12:35.910
I never borrowed it.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.751
Then I lost it.
Buy me one!

12:39.024 --> 12:42.221
You got it! Here we go!
Come on. This is great!

12:45.331 --> 12:46.389
Does it hurt?

12:46.932 --> 12:50.800
No, I always see guys do this
when handcuffs are taken off.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.970
Hello, sweet pants!

12:56.375 --> 12:58.536
Wait!
What will you tell Joanna?

12:58.911 --> 12:59.900
About what?

13:00.146 --> 13:04.742
She'll see you're gone and know
I let you out, and I'll get fired!

13:04.950 --> 13:06.884
I'll tell a lie!
I'm good at lying!

13:07.086 --> 13:09.054
I actually did borrow your Walkman!

13:09.588 --> 13:12.455
She'll know I have
a key to her office.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.751
I've got to lock you back up.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.061
I don't think so.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.174
This is much better.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.311
Here's somebody interesting.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.912
What do you know about Van Gogh?

13:38.751 --> 13:40.981
-He cut off his ear.
-And?

13:41.587 --> 13:42.918
I'm out.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.248
He painted that.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.157
That's pretty nice.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.462
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.

13:51.697 --> 13:54.291
-What else you got in there?
-Let's see....

13:54.967 --> 13:57.299
-Where does the Pope live?
-ln the woods.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.469
Wait, that's the joke answer.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.636
Actually, it's Vatican City.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.507
Now, what do you know about
vulcanized rubber?

14:08.714 --> 14:10.545
Spock's birth control.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.844
You need these books.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.190
This used to be your room?

14:24.630 --> 14:28.122
You must have been in
really good shape as a kid.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.903
I'm such an idiot!

14:33.372 --> 14:36.136
I can't believe I thought
she could change.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.170
Who cares what your mom thinks?

14:39.411 --> 14:41.641
So you "pulled a Monica."

14:42.715 --> 14:44.876
I'm glad that's catching on.

14:45.084 --> 14:49.214
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.048
Prove your mother wrong.

14:51.257 --> 14:55.193
You finish the job, and
we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

14:55.895 --> 14:56.884
What?

14:57.663 --> 15:02.726
If a kid gets straight A's, his
parents say, "You pulled a Monica."

15:04.503 --> 15:08.098
A fireman saves a baby,
and they go, "He pulled a Monica."

15:10.276 --> 15:14.076
Someone hits a homer, and they say,
"That one's out of here."

15:14.280 --> 15:16.373
Because some things don't change.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.782
All right.
I'll go down there.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.920
I won't serve the lasagna.
I'll serve what I make.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.957
My breasts are really strong.

15:42.708 --> 15:47.441
I have to get you locked back up.
I'm so going to lose my job!

15:47.646 --> 15:50.206
She's very private about her office!

15:50.716 --> 15:52.581
Now I know why!

15:53.085 --> 15:54.950
You're in trouble either way.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.415
If she sees me locked to this...

15:57.656 --> 16:01.319
...she'll know you were here.
You might as well let me go.

16:03.996 --> 16:07.898
-I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
-Still won't be clean.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.727
All I want is my freedom.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.768
-Foot rubs for a month!
-Freedom!

16:14.006 --> 16:17.840
-I'll put all your photos into albums!
-I want my freedom!

16:18.077 --> 16:20.568
Why won't you hear me!
Sophie, help me!

16:20.813 --> 16:22.440
Sophie, sit!

16:24.750 --> 16:26.581
Would you just calm down?!

16:33.959 --> 16:36.757
I'm going to say this
for the last time.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.089
Would you please just

16:43.702 --> 16:46.364
There's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.371
In a minute.

16:53.278 --> 16:54.677
So what do you say?

16:54.947 --> 16:58.383
You get the whole set
of encyclopedias for $1200.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.685
That works out to
just 50 bucks a book.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.514
$1200?

17:05.391 --> 17:07.325
You think I have $1200?

17:08.227 --> 17:09.922
I'm home during the day...

17:10.129 --> 17:13.326
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.961
There's a few things
you don't get from book learning.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.032
Well, what can you swing?

17:20.806 --> 17:24.867
How about zero down and zero a month
for a long, long time?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.244
You don't have anything?

17:28.514 --> 17:30.379
You want to see what I got?

17:31.050 --> 17:34.019
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

17:34.353 --> 17:37.754
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

17:40.092 --> 17:41.525
...a rock...

17:42.027 --> 17:43.892
...and an army man.

17:44.763 --> 17:48.199
Okay, I get the picture.
Thanks for your time.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.161
And a fifty.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.370
These must be Chandler's pants.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.104
For $50 you can get one book.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.172
What will it be?
A? B? C?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.038
I'll stick with the V.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.113
I want to see how
this bad boy turns out.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.689
I will buy and wrap
all of your Christmas gifts!

18:13.125 --> 18:16.583
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice
every morning!

18:16.929 --> 18:18.294
-With extra pulp?
-Yeah.

18:23.635 --> 18:24.795
I've got it!

18:25.304 --> 18:27.465
You don't have it.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.434
I have so got it!

18:30.209 --> 18:33.201
There will be rumors about this.
No way to stop it.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.403
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.547
-How do they know?
-I called them.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.281
When they ask me what I saw...

18:41.487 --> 18:44.581
...I can be very generous...

18:46.325 --> 18:48.418
...or very stingy.

18:50.662 --> 18:51.993
Go on.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.095
I can make you a legend.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.835
I can make you
this generation's Milton Berle.

18:59.738 --> 19:03.230
-And Milton Berle has
-Not compared to you.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.307
They're not even
touching the lasagna.

19:10.582 --> 19:11.913
They love your casserole!

19:13.018 --> 19:16.749
It's hard to believe a while
ago this was just ingredients.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.585
Everyone seems to like your dish.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.116
And you?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.456
I thought it was...

19:26.798 --> 19:28.265
...quite tasty.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.470
So if everyone liked it,
and you liked it...

19:32.704 --> 19:36.037
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you....

19:36.308 --> 19:38.173
A bitch?

19:39.278 --> 19:41.712
I meant "wrong,"
but we can use your word.

19:43.215 --> 19:45.342
Yes, well, I was wrong.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.646
And I have to say...

19:48.954 --> 19:50.888
...you really impressed me today.

19:53.959 --> 19:57.053
You might even say that she
"pulled a Monica."

19:59.698 --> 20:01.996
She doesn't know we switched it.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.467
And the next time you cater for me...

20:07.206 --> 20:10.300
...there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.470
That really means a lot.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.073
Mom, don't bite your nails!

20:24.156 --> 20:25.987
Hello, Chandler.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.517
I love you.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.226
What's going on?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.930
No, he doesn't!

20:40.939 --> 20:42.600
Two hours, that lasted.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.043
So did you break up with Joanna?

20:46.278 --> 20:47.540
I think so.

20:47.846 --> 20:51.782
It's good you got out,
before she blew up like Vesuvius.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.241
The volcano?

20:54.553 --> 20:59.547
Speaking of volcanoes, man, are they
a violent igneous rock formation!

21:00.592 --> 21:01.581
What?

21:01.793 --> 21:04.523
Lava spewing, hot ash.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.527
Of course, some are dormant.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.758
Why are you talking about volcanoes
all of a sudden?

21:10.035 --> 21:11.093
We don't have to.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.703
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?

21:14.973 --> 21:16.941
The vas deferens?

21:17.709 --> 21:19.609
The Vietnam War?

21:19.911 --> 21:23.210
Did anyone see that documentary
on the Korean War?

21:25.484 --> 21:27.213
Korea's a beautiful country.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.250
With such a sad history.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.218
Could there be more Kims?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.064
-Who's out there?
-Me! Good morning!

21:44.269 --> 21:46.134
Could you come in here, please?

21:46.338 --> 21:49.466
Sure! They didn't have
poppyseed bagels...

21:50.108 --> 21:53.100
...so I have sesame
Oh, my word!

21:54.780 --> 21:56.975
I've had a slight office mishap.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.680
Could you get the key for me?

22:11.496 --> 22:14.329
-lf you could.
-Oh, I'm sorry!

22:16.802 --> 22:20.795
You can tell your friend Chandler
we're definitely broken up this time!
