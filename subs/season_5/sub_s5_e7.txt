00:03.436 --> 00:05.233
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?

00:05.805 --> 00:07.136
No, look.

00:08.441 --> 00:09.999
That's a pig.

00:10.477 --> 00:13.139
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!

00:18.985 --> 00:20.976
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.346
-What?
-Why?

00:22.589 --> 00:25.285
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

00:25.492 --> 00:29.622
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

00:29.829 --> 00:31.353
Didn't you sign a lease?

00:31.598 --> 00:33.998
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

00:36.369 --> 00:38.360
You can stay with us.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.128
Anything you need.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.173
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

00:43.443 --> 00:45.206
...so we can make fun of your hair.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.045
You got it.

00:49.449 --> 00:54.011
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.

00:54.287 --> 00:57.779
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.058
-What?
-He thought you said gonad.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.860
The One Where Ross Moves ln

01:54.013 --> 01:57.744
If every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.782
Oh, Larry!

02:00.420 --> 02:02.945
Do health inspectors
work on commission?

02:03.189 --> 02:04.554
No, bribes.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.859
-It's okay to laugh?
-I was just kidding.

02:09.028 --> 02:12.122
-I'll check the kitchen floor.
-Knock yourself out.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.561
I don't get violations.
You could eat beans off that floor.

02:16.736 --> 02:19.967
But don't, because that'd be a violation.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.532
Yummy!

02:24.944 --> 02:27.606
Yeah, I'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.745
A ninety-eight.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.215
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.583
That is a Section 5 violation.

02:38.791 --> 02:40.952
Now look, Larry, honey.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.828
I wrote the book on Section 5.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.554
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.496
-Where's your hat?
-ln the kitchen. I'll get it.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.267
There's the two points!

02:54.073 --> 02:56.803
You should really read
that book you wrote.

03:04.250 --> 03:09.153
You saw the hat in the kitchen and
knew she'd go in hatless to get it.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.756
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.321
I don't know about that.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.088
But then I could be
your sidekick, Voonda.

03:19.098 --> 03:22.295
Maybe I could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

03:22.635 --> 03:24.330
She would love that...

03:25.004 --> 03:28.132
...since you know
all the clean places to eat.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.639
I'll call you.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.941
He's so funny!

03:45.692 --> 03:47.182
Thank you.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.130
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

03:51.397 --> 03:52.728
He's not great.

03:52.999 --> 03:56.025
But he's dealing with it.
Wait, you're not

03:56.236 --> 03:59.637
I can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.340
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.306
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.879
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.885
-Two pounds of mocha java.
-It's Danny.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.518
Are you going to go out again?

04:19.726 --> 04:22.559
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.856
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt. I'm all:

04:27.000 --> 04:28.592
And then nothing.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.565
Wow, thirsty.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.230
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.004
-Fun.
-Great!

04:38.211 --> 04:39.678
I'm looking forward to it.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.072
See you!

04:46.185 --> 04:48.779
So I guess we won't
be warming his house.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.082
All right, I see what he's doing.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.353
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

04:58.765 --> 04:59.754
And you won't do that.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.365
That's right!

05:01.601 --> 05:04.695
Because that would give him
the control.

05:04.937 --> 05:08.065
So now he comes up with this
"I've got a party" thing...

05:08.274 --> 05:10.902
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.044
Blew up in his face, didn't it?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.311
So there is no party?

05:17.283 --> 05:20.218
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.920
But the power?

05:22.121 --> 05:24.282
That is still up for grabs.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.487
You follow me?

05:26.759 --> 05:28.021
I think so.

05:28.227 --> 05:32.095
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

05:32.565 --> 05:33.554
Exactly!

05:36.402 --> 05:39.462
Then why didn't he invite me?

05:42.775 --> 05:44.572
To throw me off.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.648
Hey, roomies!

05:58.958 --> 06:00.949
I love what you've done
with the place.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.025
I know it's a lot of boxes.

06:03.262 --> 06:07.164
-I appreciate you letting me stay here.
-Not a problem.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.494
Since you'll be here a while...

06:09.702 --> 06:12.671
...we could put your name
on the answering machine.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.836
I hope you don't mind...

06:15.041 --> 06:18.442
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.509
Check it out.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.211
We will

06:27.487 --> 06:29.853
We will call you back

06:33.059 --> 06:34.526
Pretty cool.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.963
-You're fake laughing too, right?
-The tears are real.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.732
You look beautiful this evening.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.039
Show me the badge again.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.213
Shiny.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.909
You mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

07:01.187 --> 07:03.246
You are just nonstop!

07:14.167 --> 07:15.896
-We're out of here.
-Why?

07:16.102 --> 07:19.936
I saw 1 0 violations.
I'm shutting this place down!

07:20.239 --> 07:23.504
-You have the power to do that?
-This does.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.376
Shut it down.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.185
What are you doing?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.391
Nothing.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.089
You built a fort, didn't you?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.702
Kind of.

07:51.938 --> 07:55.396
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.973
All I heard for four years
through college was....

08:01.113 --> 08:03.741
You should have gone out
once in a while.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.441
-I hate this thing!
-Come on, Chandler.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.414
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

08:09.622 --> 08:13.752
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

08:18.264 --> 08:21.392
Can't believe that Larry closed down
Churman's. I love that place.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.967
You should have heard
about all their violations.

08:24.136 --> 08:28.163
Larry said that they should call it Vermin's.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.366
That guy just plain kills me.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.015
I wanted to invite you to the party.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.545
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.847
Actually, I think
I'm going to be busy.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.114
You are?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.390
Remember, I've got that gala?

08:53.799 --> 08:55.630
What's the gala for?

08:56.702 --> 08:58.966
It's a regatta gala.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.964
Do you sail?

09:01.340 --> 09:03.638
No, but I support it.

09:05.478 --> 09:09.005
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.412
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

09:15.688 --> 09:16.985
What one?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.748
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

09:20.092 --> 09:23.152
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes...

09:23.362 --> 09:27.093
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.697
But I said no...

09:28.901 --> 09:31.768
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.336
So the ball is in his court?

09:34.574 --> 09:35.666
Ball?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.740
No, there's no ball.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.213
Hey, Phoebe, you want to join us?

09:41.380 --> 09:45.009
-Oh, sure, yeah. Where is this from?
-It's from Sun Ling's.

09:45.184 --> 09:49.985
Oh, Larry just told me
something about Sun Ling.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.454
Oh, no, thank you.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.363
Joey, please.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.796
Sorry.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.581
Hello, children.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.986
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

10:30.997 --> 10:34.831
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.432
Come on!

10:42.375 --> 10:44.172
I have one question.

10:44.410 --> 10:47.072
What is the deal with this?

10:48.180 --> 10:51.172
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

10:51.917 --> 10:53.407
No, the quiet down thing.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.053
You mean this.

10:59.258 --> 11:01.556
I don't know how much more
I can take.

11:01.794 --> 11:05.890
Did you know he taped over my Baywatch
tape with a show about bugs?

11:07.566 --> 11:08.965
My God!

11:09.435 --> 11:11.733
What if that had been porn?

11:12.772 --> 11:14.672
All right, this may be tough...

11:14.874 --> 11:17.434
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.911
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.740
Let's have a game.

11:29.655 --> 11:30.644
Fellas?

11:37.463 --> 11:38.987
So he's out of here.

11:47.506 --> 11:51.533
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.

11:51.777 --> 11:56.271
I took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

11:57.183 --> 12:01.279
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.181
I don't know. Clean places?

12:03.422 --> 12:04.616
Yum!

12:10.696 --> 12:11.685
It's Danny.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.956
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.726
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

12:18.571 --> 12:21.540
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

12:22.108 --> 12:23.302
The fake kind.

12:27.813 --> 12:31.146
-I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
-We have a ladle.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.744
See you at the party.

12:37.323 --> 12:41.384
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."

12:45.865 --> 12:49.323
I'm done. You want anything?
Sports? International?

12:49.568 --> 12:50.762
Apartment listings?

12:51.570 --> 12:52.559
I'll take sports.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.103
Mine!

12:55.875 --> 12:57.399
All right, international.

12:57.676 --> 12:58.700
That's mine too.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.271
I'm ltalian.

13:03.783 --> 13:08.345
I could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.782
Not even on page seven?

13:13.726 --> 13:16.490
You're right.
Here's an affordable place.

13:16.695 --> 13:21.029
Two-bedroom, close to work.
It's available in five weeks.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.201
What about that circled one?

13:24.603 --> 13:27.868
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.802
But it's available now.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.100
Isn't it?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.800
Yes, it is.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.046
Let's go look at it!

13:36.882 --> 13:38.372
There we go!

13:40.553 --> 13:45.650
Guys, would you chip in for some
new air filters for the purifier?

13:46.058 --> 13:48.993
I mean, after all,
we are all using it.

13:49.261 --> 13:50.250
Let's go quicker!

14:04.510 --> 14:05.841
Oh, my God!

14:06.145 --> 14:09.637
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.

14:10.616 --> 14:14.017
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.016
Somebody was using his head.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.451
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.494
I think this is it.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.469
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.174
But this place is available now.

14:38.477 --> 14:41.503
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

14:47.786 --> 14:50.550
So you think I should
take this place?

14:50.823 --> 14:52.450
It's perfect!

14:56.462 --> 14:58.020
How about you?

14:58.297 --> 15:00.697
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.463
I see what you guys are saying.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.538
I'll go downstairs
and fill out an application.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.139
We are bad people.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.712
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.517
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.226
Ready for dinner?

15:31.497 --> 15:33.431
-Absolutely.
-Great.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.860
You wanted to go to
the ltalian place on Bleecker St.?

15:36.068 --> 15:37.831
I love that place!

15:38.070 --> 15:39.537
So, no.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.235
How about Mama Lozetti's?

15:43.742 --> 15:44.902
Sure.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.912
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.746
No, this place is totally healthy.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.508
This milk is mine.
I bought this today...

15:54.720 --> 15:57.621
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?

16:01.894 --> 16:03.521
Okay, let's go.

16:06.598 --> 16:07.860
Hey, buddy.

16:08.133 --> 16:13.196
Health Code 1 1 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.703
But then I have to go
all the way around.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.876
So you choose convenience
over health?

16:19.611 --> 16:24.139
Would you be interested in a free coffee?

16:24.316 --> 16:25.943
Stop, Larry.

16:27.319 --> 16:32.313
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

16:32.624 --> 16:34.455
It was exciting at first.

16:34.727 --> 16:39.096
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

16:40.099 --> 16:43.000
I suppose I could give him a warning.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.497
Thank you.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.493
Go, go!

16:50.843 --> 16:54.335
If, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

16:54.580 --> 16:57.845
...I know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

17:01.820 --> 17:05.517
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.451
That was a nice place.

17:07.693 --> 17:12.687
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.091
What do we do?

17:18.604 --> 17:20.128
I don't know.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.999
Maybe pizza?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.172
About Ross!

17:34.453 --> 17:38.150
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.553
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable

17:41.827 --> 17:46.196
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that barks into the night.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.465
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

17:51.336 --> 17:53.327
He's a tap dancer.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.502
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.402
He's a pimp!

18:01.547 --> 18:03.572
There you go. He's a pimp.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.874
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

18:26.538 --> 18:28.802
-Okay, honey, I'm ready.
-What are you doing?

18:28.974 --> 18:32.501
I am going to wander into the party
and I will be all, you know:

18:32.678 --> 18:36.307
"l don't need this,
I'm coming from a regatta gala."

18:38.951 --> 18:41.317
Did you get this out of a book?

18:41.487 --> 18:45.753
Monica, honey, this is as real as it gets.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.132
This is never going to work.
He's right there.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.429
Just go say hi.

19:00.706 --> 19:05.666
I have to go downstairs and back up,
as if I'm coming home from the gala.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.006
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.143
What's going on?

19:14.353 --> 19:17.322
This is a great party.
Great food.

19:19.024 --> 19:23.984
You know, most parties, it's all
chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

19:24.463 --> 19:25.691
So....

19:27.866 --> 19:28.855
What's this?

19:29.701 --> 19:30.690
Salad.

19:33.639 --> 19:34.867
And what's this?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.506
Bread.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.672
Aren't you a chef?

19:45.050 --> 19:47.575
Right, tonight was your party.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.912
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.

19:50.222 --> 19:53.589
Well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

19:53.759 --> 19:57.320
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.099
Whose court is the ball in now?

20:02.701 --> 20:05.465
I thought there wasn't a ball.

20:06.305 --> 20:10.708
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

20:11.009 --> 20:13.603
Ball's flying all over the place.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.045
This is my friend, Tom.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.943
This is the girl I told you about.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.143
Come on!
You telling people about me?

20:22.554 --> 20:25.284
I think you two
could really hit it off.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.620
I'm gonna go mingle.

20:29.228 --> 20:33.631
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."

20:40.906 --> 20:42.464
At ease, soldier!

20:44.209 --> 20:45.198
I'm sorry?

20:45.410 --> 20:48.846
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.038
You're Danny's wingman, right?

20:51.316 --> 20:54.683
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.883
I'm going to go talk to a friend.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.989
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.218
Go tell him, "Nice try."

21:08.233 --> 21:10.326
He just keeps lobbing them up...

21:10.535 --> 21:13.902
...and I keep knocking them
right out of the park.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.233
I think I need a drink.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.509
Ninety-eight...

21:24.716 --> 21:26.183
...ninety-nine...

21:26.418 --> 21:28.283
...one hundred!

21:28.520 --> 21:29.680
Okay. Go.

21:29.921 --> 21:32.014
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.758
Here we go, here we go.

21:40.966 --> 21:45.596
So I didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.066
You're kidding?

21:47.272 --> 21:51.436
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so....

21:51.643 --> 21:55.044
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.113
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

21:58.383 --> 22:02.786
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.818
Please, just stay.

22:07.225 --> 22:08.283
Are you sure?

22:08.560 --> 22:11.620
-Definitely.
-You have to stay.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.133
So I'm a pimp, huh?

22:21.807 --> 22:23.638
It's okay.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.173
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

22:26.411 --> 22:30.006
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

22:30.282 --> 22:35.413
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just....

22:51.503 --> 22:54.370
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.007
The cowboy hat's a little much.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.175
Come on, it's fun!

23:02.280 --> 23:03.269
All right.

23:10.922 --> 23:12.389
Isn't this a woman's hat?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.292
Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!
