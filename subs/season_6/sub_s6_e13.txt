WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:05.300
Okay, Rach, that's muffin
and espresso, $4.50.

00:05.538 --> 00:09.998
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.

00:10.243 --> 00:12.643
And Phoebe, herbal tea, $1.25.

00:12.912 --> 00:15.540
All together that's $12.75.

00:15.915 --> 00:20.147
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

00:21.988 --> 00:23.580
How much do I owe you?

00:23.790 --> 00:26.987
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.126
Great. Well, tell him thanks.

00:30.397 --> 00:33.423
And since Joey seems like
such a nice guy...

00:33.666 --> 00:35.133
maybe we could go out?

00:35.402 --> 00:37.893
He's not used to women
being so forward...

00:38.171 --> 00:41.004
but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.139
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.646
How come our stuff isn't free?

00:47.847 --> 00:51.112
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.643
I'm getting more dates than ever.

00:53.853 --> 00:56.822
You're only giving free stuff
to the pretty girls?

00:57.090 --> 00:58.990
Joey, that is so gross!

00:59.759 --> 01:02.091
How about a scone on the house, baby?

01:04.097 --> 01:05.257
I'm pretty.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.601
The One With Rachel's Sister

01:45.738 --> 01:48.571
-Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.

01:51.344 --> 01:52.936
Here. Sorry.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.712
Oh, you know what?

01:58.451 --> 01:59.611
No.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.554
Wait a second.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.797
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.296
Sorry, I guess it's in my big bag.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.197
Say, does anybody have a goldfish?

02:23.076 --> 02:25.408
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

02:25.612 --> 02:28.740
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.209
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!

02:34.154 --> 02:38.591
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.919
No one thinks that you're a pansy...

02:42.162 --> 02:44.960
but we do think
that you need a tissue.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.831
I have not been sick
in over three years.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.569
I think you're sick because
that used to be in your nose.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.304
I'll get tissue.

02:59.579 --> 03:02.673
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.442
When you put a D
at the end of fine...

03:05.752 --> 03:07.777
you're not fine.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.612
I'm fine-d.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.783
I'm fine-d.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.195
It's a really hard word to say.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.071
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.473
Oh, my God, Jill!

03:34.948 --> 03:36.609
Oh, my God, Rachel!

03:37.584 --> 03:39.711
Oh, my God, introduce us.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.449
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.924
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.916
-How you doing?
-Don't!

03:53.299 --> 03:55.426
Honey, what are you doing here?

03:55.635 --> 03:56.795
Which sister is this?

03:57.070 --> 04:00.005
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

04:00.273 --> 04:01.467
Daddy cut me off.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.266
Never mind, I got it.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.175
You know what I said?

04:05.445 --> 04:08.846
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
sue you, take all your money...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.572
and cut you off!"

04:10.817 --> 04:12.250
Wow. What did he say?

04:12.485 --> 04:14.248
That he wouldn't pay
for my lawyer.

04:15.688 --> 04:18.156
Then he told me to learn
the value of money...

04:18.424 --> 04:20.949
from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.593
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.264
My dad's proud of me.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.761
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.370
Honey, so what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?

04:34.307 --> 04:35.774
Okay, I bought a boat.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.475
You bought a boat?

04:38.144 --> 04:40.169
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.048
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.683
I knew it was stupid and
I shouldn't have done it...

04:48.855 --> 04:52.018
but she bought me all these CDs
and said I had a cute haircut.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.626
And your daddy didn't understand?

04:55.795 --> 04:59.891
I know, and usually I just cry
and say I'm sorry and he forgives me.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.934
Oh, yes, good criers, the Green girls.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.734
I mean, the Green sisters.

05:12.211 --> 05:13.610
Man, no matter how you say it...

05:13.780 --> 05:17.409
it still sounds like you're
talking about green people.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.912
I'm at rock bottom.

05:22.088 --> 05:25.285
This is the best thing that
could've happened to you.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.684
You've needed to get out on your own.

05:27.927 --> 05:31.920
When I did it, at first I was scared,
but then look at me now.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.429
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.033
I can't believe him.
How does he expect me to buy stuff?

05:40.206 --> 05:43.198
Maybe, you know, you
won't buy stuff for a while.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.310
I don't understand.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.975
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.082
You're gonna get an apartment.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.481
And then you will live off
the money that you earn.

05:54.654 --> 05:57.521
Okay, I know this is what you did...

05:57.690 --> 05:59.920
but that doesn't sound like me.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.052
Okay, but it can be. It can be you.

06:03.229 --> 06:06.255
And you can stay with us.
Right, Phoebe?

06:06.432 --> 06:09.026
-Of course, yeah.
-Oh, that's so great!

06:09.268 --> 06:12.863
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.233
Oh, I like cars.

06:21.481 --> 06:22.971
-You all finished?
-Yes.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.648
Great.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.922
Okay, here are the tips
for this morning.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.183
Jen gets 50, 50 for me
and Joey owes 8 dollars.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.024
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.167
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?

06:43.469 --> 06:46.336
We don't give anything away
unless it's a birthday.

06:47.006 --> 06:50.032
What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

06:51.310 --> 06:52.299
No.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.909
Sorry.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.145
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.688
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.485
I memorized those numbers
when I was 15.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.898
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!

07:13.166 --> 07:16.067
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.

07:16.335 --> 07:20.362
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.

07:21.441 --> 07:26.208
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.571
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
all technical.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.041
Rachel's not gonna think
it's a good idea.

07:33.386 --> 07:37.345
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!

07:39.792 --> 07:41.191
What's going on?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.928
Jill!

07:43.930 --> 07:45.363
Did you shop?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.565
No.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.960
They did.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.297
Yeah, we went shopping!

07:54.907 --> 07:56.272
You went shopping?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.639
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose...

07:59.946 --> 08:02.642
when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.148
Sorry, Jill.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.784
So, what'd you get?

08:09.055 --> 08:11.319
Oh, well, all right. Thank you.

08:11.591 --> 08:15.288
I got this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

08:17.163 --> 08:21.497
And then I got..
These are apartment pants.

08:23.603 --> 08:24.627
Apartment pants?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.571
You've never heard of them?

08:28.574 --> 08:30.565
Of course I've heard of them.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.638
Ross, what'd you get?

08:33.980 --> 08:36.278
I got this...

08:37.416 --> 08:38.849
This.

08:40.987 --> 08:43.785
-A pashmina?
-Yeah!

08:45.358 --> 08:48.259
I love these babies.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.355
Really?

08:53.599 --> 08:54.827
What's a pashmina?

08:56.502 --> 08:57.764
It's a rug.

08:59.972 --> 09:00.996
Jill?

09:02.775 --> 09:04.902
I'm sorry, Rachel.

09:05.411 --> 09:09.814
You think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.278
Right! But I am sorry.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.948
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.556
-But don't let it happen again, okay?
-Okay.

09:20.793 --> 09:25.127
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.

09:25.331 --> 09:28.528
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.066
And the pants.

09:33.839 --> 09:37.570
I'll take it all, because that way,
you'll learn the lesson.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.708
Alrighty.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.678
I'm gonna run a couple of errands
and I will see you at dinner.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.920
She took all my stuff.

09:49.188 --> 09:53.818
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.357
That's the best one!

09:55.561 --> 09:58.155
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!

09:58.364 --> 10:00.229
Well, hey.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.458
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.367
Oh, yeah? How about you
with the "I'm sorry"?

10:08.574 --> 10:10.735
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.

10:10.943 --> 10:15.107
What about what I said about
the apartment pants? How dumb was l?

10:18.784 --> 10:21.548
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.222
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.751
Why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it?

10:31.197 --> 10:33.097
Okay. So, what do you want to do?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.699
Let's do something crazy.

10:35.901 --> 10:38.927
I know, let's rest and drink
lots of fluids.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.437
Okay, I'll rest.

10:41.641 --> 10:46.203
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

10:47.913 --> 10:51.644
See, that would be impossible
to resist if you weren't all...

10:51.917 --> 10:53.282
drippy here.

10:55.254 --> 10:59.623
Are you saying that you don't
want to get with this?

11:04.130 --> 11:07.293
I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.894
Come on.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.837
Don't take this personally.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.805
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

11:19.679 --> 11:24.173
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!

11:24.417 --> 11:25.509
But I'm not sick!

11:25.951 --> 11:27.942
Let me prove it to you.

11:28.954 --> 11:33.948
We are two healthy people
in the prime of lime.

11:34.827 --> 11:39.287
See, that's the thing, I would like
to stay in the "prime of lime."

11:45.805 --> 11:48.273
Oh, okay, now I'll do it.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.003
Hey. What's up?

11:55.281 --> 11:57.806
I think there's something
you should know.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.678
Better not be about
the apartment pants.

11:59.852 --> 12:05.085
I just pitched the idea to my boss
at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.121
No. It's just, I was...

12:08.394 --> 12:10.487
I was with Ross and Jill
after you left...

12:10.696 --> 12:13.995
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.033
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.569
But I wanted to warn you
that there might be something.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.835
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.374
With Ross and my sister?

12:28.380 --> 12:31.577
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

12:33.319 --> 12:35.787
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.

12:35.988 --> 12:38.923
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!

12:39.558 --> 12:42.527
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
but my sister?

12:42.728 --> 12:44.753
Isn't that incest or something?

12:45.898 --> 12:47.866
And they're gonna have sex.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.335
Oh, no! What if he marries her too?

12:51.537 --> 12:54.062
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.673
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.845
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.

13:00.079 --> 13:04.015
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
is marrying my little sister.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.515
This is the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.122
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.085
That'll be $3.85.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.229
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.963
It's just, I can't,
because my manager said that I..

13:24.570 --> 13:27.767
Happy birthday to you

13:27.973 --> 13:30.271
Happy birthday to you

13:30.476 --> 13:33.411
-Happy birthday, dear Annie..
-Amy!

13:33.646 --> 13:35.773
Amy

13:36.048 --> 13:38.243
Happy birthday to you

13:38.984 --> 13:41.384
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.452
Not in here, it isn't.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.789
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

13:51.163 --> 13:55.259
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.561
No. But I walked past three sales
and didn't go in.

13:58.804 --> 13:59.998
How strong am I?

14:01.607 --> 14:02.938
That is great.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.575
You know who doesn't have to
job-hunt? Ross.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.178
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?

14:09.515 --> 14:13.246
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?

14:15.187 --> 14:17.849
Me go out with Ross? No.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.524
God, no.
What would make you think that?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.252
Phoebe...

14:22.494 --> 14:25.759
said she thought she saw something
between you guys.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.761
I mean, he's nice.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.458
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.

14:31.670 --> 14:35.299
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.440
Not so much.

14:38.978 --> 14:43.881
Oh, not so much. What do you mean?
Is there something wrong with Ross?

14:44.183 --> 14:45.844
No, no, no. He's just...

14:46.118 --> 14:48.985
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.847
Are you saying he's a geek?

14:52.124 --> 14:53.682
You think so too?

14:54.693 --> 14:57.025
No. Ross is not a geek.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.127
Then let's just say
he's not my type.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.857
Handsome is not your type?

15:03.135 --> 15:04.830
Smart, kind, good kisser.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.232
What, those things aren't
on your list?

15:07.473 --> 15:10.169
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.236
If it means that much,
then I'll ask him out.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.037
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.010
You know what? You're right.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.548
He has been really nice to me.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.211
Yeah, but he's not your type.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.388
But maybe that's good.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.684
I'm doing all these different things.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.862
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.730
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.928
You remember what happened
to the little girl who...

15:40.205 --> 15:42.230
tried too much too fast, don't you?

15:43.909 --> 15:45.001
What?

15:45.711 --> 15:48.009
She died, Jill.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.313
Chandler!

15:57.556 --> 16:00.992
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

16:07.199 --> 16:08.894
Calling Dr. Big.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.363
Dr. Big to the bed.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.703
Jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

16:16.041 --> 16:20.637
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?

16:22.281 --> 16:23.509
I was asleep.

16:27.886 --> 16:31.287
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
Layers.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.289
Layers are sexy.

16:33.525 --> 16:37.154
And blankets are sexy.
And hot-water bottles are sexy.

16:37.396 --> 16:40.024
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.

16:40.532 --> 16:43.968
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.696
Would you please get some rest?

16:47.906 --> 16:49.567
I'm fine.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.240
-You're coughing.
-No, I'm not.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.447
No, I'm not, I'm laughing.

17:01.453 --> 17:04.081
-At what?
-Just something I heard before.

17:04.256 --> 17:09.819
-Tell me.
-No, I don't want it to spoil the mood.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.127
Happy birthday to you

17:20.839 --> 17:23.808
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.739
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 women today.

17:28.147 --> 17:32.174
You are no longer authorized
to distribute birthday muffins.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.418
Damn it!

17:39.691 --> 17:41.989
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?

17:43.028 --> 17:46.862
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.130
I think she's cute, but...

17:51.370 --> 17:54.601
I never would've thought of
going out with her. Never!

17:55.207 --> 17:56.265
Really?

17:56.475 --> 17:58.807
But after you said it's okay,
I figured, "Why not?"

18:00.679 --> 18:02.840
Oh, so not really "never."

18:03.782 --> 18:06.842
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.713
I mean, after all we've been through.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.385
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.461
If you ever date Monica,
you have my blessing.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.187
And mine.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.192
Chandler?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.736
I think I'm sick.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.028
Really?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.331
Struck down in the "pribe of libe."

18:32.644 --> 18:36.580
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.248
Will you please rub this on my chest?

18:40.819 --> 18:44.016
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.589
Come on, I really need your help here.

18:49.995 --> 18:53.021
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.

19:12.384 --> 19:16.013
So you're just kind of
rubbing it on yourself?

19:18.023 --> 19:20.787
-Yeah.
-It's nice.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.860
You kidding me?
Is this turning you on?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.595
Yes.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.567
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

19:30.869 --> 19:33.360
It's all very, very good.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.609
So you want to go...

19:41.280 --> 19:42.872
mix it up?

19:44.650 --> 19:47.551
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!

19:49.755 --> 19:52.053
What about never sleeping
with sick people?

19:52.424 --> 19:56.417
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.721
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.169
Worked like a charm.

20:11.677 --> 20:12.666
Why are you here?

20:13.178 --> 20:17.478
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

20:19.184 --> 20:20.242
I don't like it.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.783
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.815
It's yours.

20:29.528 --> 20:31.860
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

20:33.532 --> 20:34.760
Me too.

20:38.637 --> 20:39.968
Hi, Jill.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.469
Hi...

20:42.608 --> 20:44.007
Rachel.

20:45.711 --> 20:49.203
You're not at home,
you're right here.

20:49.815 --> 20:50.873
Yeah, I know.

20:51.183 --> 20:55.313
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.125
Okay.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.054
So, well, I'll...

21:05.330 --> 21:07.321
I'll have her home by midnight.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.653
Why aren't you home yet?

21:29.921 --> 21:31.980
Is someone there?

21:32.557 --> 21:35.355
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.759
What are you doing here?

21:39.231 --> 21:41.927
I'm just looking out your window...

21:42.200 --> 21:43.565
at the view.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.334
What are you guys doing?

21:47.372 --> 21:50.535
We got some vapor rub in some places.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.343
He brought her back to his apartment.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.679
Who?

22:04.222 --> 22:05.450
Is that your sister?

22:06.725 --> 22:09.057
She is a slut!

22:10.629 --> 22:13.598
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?

22:13.932 --> 22:16.366
Oh, my God, he's taking off
her clothes!

22:16.802 --> 22:18.963
He's taking off her coat.

22:19.771 --> 22:21.432
Oh, this is just terrible.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.773
Oh, no, it's not. It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...

22:33.285 --> 22:35.310
He's gonna get some.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.921
Of the glare...

22:40.926 --> 22:43.053
from the streetlight
out of his apartment.

22:43.562 --> 22:47.225
You know, so he's closed
the drapes there...

22:47.432 --> 22:50.230
so he can have a nice, pleasant...

22:50.435 --> 22:53.302
conversation with
your little sister.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.664
Well, I'm off to bed.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.749
I don't feel good.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.018
You better not get me sick.

23:16.661 --> 23:21.724
I need some fruit
or some juice or some....

23:24.803 --> 23:26.168
Or some nothing.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.465
There's nothing in here.
Who took our food?

23:29.641 --> 23:33.600
Can I interest you in a slice
of lasagna or a drumstick?

23:33.779 --> 23:36.873
-No, thanks.
-Are you sure? It's on the house.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.710
-No, thanks.
-How about going out with me Friday night?

23:39.885 --> 23:42.479
-No, thanks.
-What are you gonna do.
