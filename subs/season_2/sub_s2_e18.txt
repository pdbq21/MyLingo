WEBVTT

00:03.168 --> 00:07.768
-It's not fair. It's my money.
-I know, but it's what Bread wanted.

00:08.168 --> 00:10.836
-Ok, which one is she?
-That's Bread's widow.

00:11.068 --> 00:14.068
-Why she didn't upset?
-Because she just find out and cut the wire.

00:15.068 --> 00:23.068
-Didn't she find out she can't define the money.
-No.

00:26.068 --> 00:29.037
-Oh, Drake.
-I'm sorry, Amber.

00:29.271 --> 00:31.831
It's like Brad to have
to have the last word.

00:32.842 --> 00:34.400
Sorry I'm late.
What happened?

00:34.677 --> 00:35.769
We wanna see the end.

00:36.178 --> 00:37.440
I want you, Drake.

00:37.713 --> 00:38.873
I know you do.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.242
But we can never
be together that way.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.781
What?

00:43.019 --> 00:45.044
There's something I never told you.

00:45.287 --> 00:48.085
I'm actually your half-brother.

00:53.529 --> 00:54.962
So what happens next?

00:55.364 --> 00:58.663
I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

00:58.868 --> 01:03.202
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

01:04.407 --> 01:08.207
...where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

01:08.411 --> 01:10.242
But it's cursed.

01:10.946 --> 01:11.776
So cool!

01:12.048 --> 01:13.811
God, that is good TV!

01:16.152 --> 01:18.211
The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies

02:03.565 --> 02:05.294
Pheebs, play with me!

02:06.634 --> 02:07.999
This game is grotesque!

02:08.236 --> 02:12.138
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

02:12.474 --> 02:15.466
...forced to play soccer forever?

02:15.977 --> 02:18.070
Hello? Human rights violation!

02:18.947 --> 02:21.108
Don't feel so bad.
After playing...

02:21.316 --> 02:25.275
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a good time.

02:26.821 --> 02:29.016
Why don't you play with your roommate?

02:30.658 --> 02:32.626
He's not a big fan of foosball.

02:32.827 --> 02:35.591
Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

02:35.797 --> 02:39.699
No, he's all right. He spends
most of his time in his room.

02:39.968 --> 02:42.436
That's because you haven't
gotten to know him.

02:42.670 --> 02:44.262
Let's remedy that, shall we?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.674
-We don't need to.
-lt'll be fun!

02:50.111 --> 02:50.941
What was that?

02:52.814 --> 02:56.682
I thought it'd be fun if we had
beers and got to know each other.

02:57.185 --> 02:58.049
All right.

02:58.286 --> 02:59.947
Oh, good! Okay.

03:00.155 --> 03:04.649
Oh, no! I have to go,
because I'm late for...

03:04.893 --> 03:06.986
... my Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.832
Tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."

03:12.500 --> 03:14.661
-Have fun! Bye!
-That was so lame.

03:14.869 --> 03:16.200
I know.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.470
Okay, talk to him.

03:22.310 --> 03:27.247
So you think that Speed Racer guy
gets a lot of tickets or...?

03:30.385 --> 03:32.819
That's good.
So who broke up with who?

03:33.054 --> 03:34.146
I broke up with her.

03:34.389 --> 03:37.916
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.659
When everybody knows that
the capital of Cambodia is....

03:44.766 --> 03:46.529
It's not Sean Penn.

03:47.935 --> 03:48.867
I got a funny one.

03:50.036 --> 03:53.597
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

03:53.807 --> 03:56.207
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.470
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

03:59.713 --> 04:01.613
... I don't wanna see you anymore."

04:01.882 --> 04:04.749
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

04:04.985 --> 04:08.318
... ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

04:09.556 --> 04:12.423
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

04:12.659 --> 04:16.390
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

04:20.734 --> 04:22.725
That wasn't such a funny story.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.807
And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can

04:30.077 --> 04:32.409
And the rest of the rats
Played maracas

04:35.082 --> 04:37.277
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.147
Phoebe's got another job, right?

04:42.490 --> 04:44.253
Great set tonight, Pheebs.

04:44.459 --> 04:45.619
I know.

04:46.627 --> 04:47.958
We should get going.

04:48.696 --> 04:51.494
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

04:51.699 --> 04:53.963
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

04:54.202 --> 04:56.432
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

04:56.971 --> 04:59.132
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

05:00.708 --> 05:02.005
You don't need them.

05:02.543 --> 05:05.103
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.974
Shut up. I'm happy.

05:10.051 --> 05:12.849
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

05:13.521 --> 05:18.185
Of all the guys that Monica has
been with, and that is a lot...

05:20.561 --> 05:22.722
...I like you the best.

05:23.397 --> 05:26.059
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

05:26.634 --> 05:27.726
You hear that?

05:28.035 --> 05:31.493
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

05:33.307 --> 05:34.399
Not a lot.

05:34.675 --> 05:37.143
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.677
Phoebe's dead.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.379
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

05:50.024 --> 05:52.254
He's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

05:52.527 --> 05:55.360
Can I take a message or....
Or a fish tank?

05:55.563 --> 05:56.723
Thanks.

05:57.265 --> 05:58.596
Come on in.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.058
I'm Tilly.

06:06.507 --> 06:09.169
I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.

06:09.377 --> 06:12.210
Yeah, your name came up...

06:12.446 --> 06:15.938
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

06:17.351 --> 06:18.716
He's kind of intense.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.718
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

06:21.956 --> 06:22.854
A little what?

06:23.057 --> 06:24.581
...bit country?

06:27.581 --> 06:30.581
You know, a little rock and roll.

06:32.995 --> 06:34.360
Come on in, you roomie!

06:35.564 --> 06:36.895
Hello, Tilly.

06:37.099 --> 06:39.533
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

06:40.035 --> 06:41.935
That was very thoughtful of you.

06:42.171 --> 06:43.661
It's very thoughtful.

06:48.010 --> 06:49.534
Well, okay then.

06:50.246 --> 06:52.214
I'm gonna go. Bye.

06:56.685 --> 06:57.777
So we getting a fish?

06:58.587 --> 06:59.747
You had sex with her.

07:04.059 --> 07:05.686
Check it out, check it out!

07:05.928 --> 07:10.058
Soap Opera Digest!
That's one of my favorite digests!

07:11.533 --> 07:14.024
Page 42! Page 42!

07:16.071 --> 07:19.802
"New Doc on the Block,
Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani."

07:20.042 --> 07:21.737
Cool picture!

07:22.311 --> 07:23.972
Oh, I look good.

07:25.648 --> 07:28.981
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

07:29.618 --> 07:31.108
Well, kind of, yeah.

07:32.421 --> 07:35.322
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

07:35.557 --> 07:37.354
The line in the script was...

07:37.559 --> 07:40.995
... "If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."

07:41.297 --> 07:44.266
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

07:44.466 --> 07:46.400
...she's not gonna live."

07:48.003 --> 07:51.461
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

07:54.009 --> 07:58.002
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

07:59.748 --> 08:04.082
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

08:06.989 --> 08:08.354
But you know what?

08:08.590 --> 08:11.991
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

08:12.261 --> 08:15.924
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

08:17.433 --> 08:19.458
Makes up most of his lines.

08:19.668 --> 08:20.930
Son of a....

08:23.872 --> 08:25.669
Write this, jerk-weed.

08:25.874 --> 08:27.603
I fall down an elevator shaft?

08:27.843 --> 08:30.812
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

08:31.013 --> 08:34.471
I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

08:36.018 --> 08:39.454
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

08:39.788 --> 08:41.346
Right.

08:42.691 --> 08:43.658
Could you sign?

08:43.892 --> 08:46.827
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

08:47.029 --> 08:50.294
I don't think that will affect
the plot of the show.

08:51.533 --> 08:53.728
How can they do this to me?

08:56.705 --> 08:59.071
All right, I'm just gonna go.

08:59.842 --> 09:00.866
Sorry.

09:07.149 --> 09:09.208
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

09:09.418 --> 09:12.353
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

09:12.721 --> 09:14.552
...it's a very small percentage.

09:15.324 --> 09:18.054
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

09:18.327 --> 09:19.988
-Good night.
-Good night, Richard.

09:20.229 --> 09:22.060
Good luck, Mon.

09:22.264 --> 09:26.530
Before I tell you, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

09:28.637 --> 09:29.569
Two.

09:30.005 --> 09:32.166
Two? Two?

09:33.275 --> 09:35.402
How is that possible? I mean...

09:35.611 --> 09:37.704
... have you seen you?

09:39.848 --> 09:41.213
I mean, what can I say?

09:41.450 --> 09:45.614
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

09:45.854 --> 09:47.788
Now you. That's two.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.947
Two it is.

09:50.959 --> 09:53.223
Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

09:54.296 --> 09:55.957
No, wait a minute now!

09:56.198 --> 09:57.927
Come on, it's your turn.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.963
Oh, come on!

10:01.236 --> 10:04.933
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

10:06.442 --> 10:09.468
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

10:14.283 --> 10:16.649
I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

10:16.952 --> 10:18.613
Tell me about it.

10:18.887 --> 10:21.447
So what's your magic number?

10:24.259 --> 10:28.559
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

10:29.131 --> 10:31.497
Well, there's you.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.730
Better not be doing these in order.

10:36.138 --> 10:39.301
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

10:39.842 --> 10:40.968
Barry.

10:42.277 --> 10:43.107
Paolo.

10:43.445 --> 10:46.471
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

10:48.317 --> 10:51.912
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

10:52.154 --> 10:55.749
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

10:55.958 --> 10:57.983
-Really?
-Oh, please!

10:58.260 --> 11:01.252
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

11:01.630 --> 11:05.157
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

11:09.271 --> 11:14.004
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.440
I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

11:17.646 --> 11:20.877
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

11:21.183 --> 11:24.277
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

11:24.520 --> 11:26.681
...dropped off a fish tank and left!

11:27.022 --> 11:27.886
Where's Buddy?

11:28.457 --> 11:29.287
Buddy?

11:29.791 --> 11:31.156
My fish, Buddy.

11:32.227 --> 11:34.491
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

11:34.730 --> 11:36.391
This is unbelievable!

11:37.166 --> 11:41.125
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

11:41.370 --> 11:43.304
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

11:43.705 --> 11:45.332
I didn't kill your fish!

11:45.641 --> 11:47.370
Look, Eddie

11:50.812 --> 11:53.007
Would you look at what I'm doing?

11:53.549 --> 11:55.016
Now that can't be smart.

11:58.587 --> 12:01.579
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

12:01.823 --> 12:04.314
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

12:06.395 --> 12:07.692
Tangelo?

12:17.172 --> 12:21.233
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

12:21.510 --> 12:23.569
Well, that's not bad at all.

12:23.812 --> 12:26.508
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

12:27.950 --> 12:28.974
You're okay with it?

12:29.184 --> 12:30.913
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

12:35.657 --> 12:37.488
Okay, about that two.

12:37.926 --> 12:38.984
What?

12:39.194 --> 12:40.183
All right.

12:41.129 --> 12:42.255
What about my two?

12:42.464 --> 12:45.126
It just seems like
a really small number.

12:45.334 --> 12:46.358
Right.

12:48.871 --> 12:51.806
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

12:52.508 --> 12:56.808
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

12:57.713 --> 12:59.476
Honey, you are not an oat.

12:59.682 --> 13:03.482
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

13:03.686 --> 13:05.654
I've only slept with women I love.

13:06.255 --> 13:08.018
You've only slept with two people.

13:13.028 --> 13:14.017
Right.

13:22.037 --> 13:24.096
You know I love you too, right?

13:25.007 --> 13:26.668
Now I do.

13:32.514 --> 13:35.108
Ross, please listen to me.

13:35.351 --> 13:38.343
You are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

13:38.587 --> 13:41.613
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

13:41.924 --> 13:44.358
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

13:44.593 --> 13:46.686
Invite Paolo to have
a romp in the sack...

13:46.929 --> 13:49.955
...and I'll stand in the corner
and tell knock-knock jokes!

13:53.469 --> 13:56.529
What we have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was

13:56.772 --> 13:57.932
"Animal sex"?

14:01.276 --> 14:02.937
So what are you saying?

14:03.212 --> 14:06.113
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

14:06.382 --> 14:10.250
There's not even,
like, a little animal?

14:10.486 --> 14:12.078
Not even, like...

14:12.454 --> 14:13.716
...chipmunk sex?

14:17.459 --> 14:20.223
Try to hear me, okay?

14:20.462 --> 14:22.555
I'm not gonna lie to you.

14:23.165 --> 14:26.464
-lt was good with Paolo.
-Knock-knock.

14:28.737 --> 14:31.672
But what you and I have
is so much better.

14:31.974 --> 14:36.274
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

14:36.478 --> 14:37.945
You know? I swear.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.273
This is the best...

14:40.516 --> 14:43.178
... I have ever had.

14:44.853 --> 14:45.683
Until now.

14:54.430 --> 14:55.920
Richard told me he loved me.

14:56.198 --> 14:57.256
-Oh, my God!
-I know!

14:57.499 --> 14:58.830
Honey, that's great!

14:59.034 --> 15:00.262
I know!

15:00.469 --> 15:02.164
-I just can't find
-Top drawer.

15:02.371 --> 15:05.033
-Hurry.
-Why? You need one too?

15:07.509 --> 15:08.942
Found them!

15:13.615 --> 15:14.513
There's only one.

15:17.853 --> 15:21.721
We'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

15:39.842 --> 15:43.209
-They're trying to decide something.
-Good. Good, good.

15:49.551 --> 15:53.749
So was your mustache
Did it used to be different?

16:00.863 --> 16:03.855
How do you, you know,
keep it so neat?

16:05.834 --> 16:06.698
I have a comb.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.371
-What is that?
-A mustache comb.

16:13.575 --> 16:14.906
Thank you.

16:16.278 --> 16:20.112
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

16:22.684 --> 16:24.345
I will, I will, I will....

16:24.553 --> 16:27.215
I will clean the apartment
for two months.

16:27.456 --> 16:31.722
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

16:41.537 --> 16:43.095
So were you in Nam?

16:50.095 --> 16:53.095
We are both adults here.
We must got some way to solve this.

16:53.743 --> 16:55.938
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Gotcha.

16:56.546 --> 16:58.275
One, two, three.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.038
Yes!

17:01.450 --> 17:03.577
Fine. Go have sex.

17:06.055 --> 17:08.421
No! You have got it completely wrong!

17:08.624 --> 17:11.491
John Savage was Deer Hunter,
no legs.

17:11.727 --> 17:14.594
Jon Voight was Coming Home,
couldn't feel his legs.

17:14.830 --> 17:18.960
You've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight

17:19.168 --> 17:20.999
-Honey?
-What?

17:29.612 --> 17:30.442
Shall we?

17:30.646 --> 17:32.079
It's not gonna happen.

17:32.348 --> 17:35.613
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

17:38.588 --> 17:41.853
In the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand....

17:45.628 --> 17:47.425
So when I woke up this morning...

17:47.630 --> 17:50.758
... he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

17:51.167 --> 17:52.099
Why?

17:52.335 --> 17:56.169
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

17:56.439 --> 17:58.202
Why would you kill his fish?

18:01.644 --> 18:04.272
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

18:04.513 --> 18:06.879
...you have to kill a fish.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.383
Chandler, honey...

18:10.653 --> 18:11.779
... I'm sorry.

18:11.988 --> 18:14.320
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

18:14.857 --> 18:16.347
Wait. He's not here yet.

18:16.559 --> 18:18.117
He knows what happens.

18:20.062 --> 18:22.530
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

18:25.735 --> 18:26.963
Amber...

18:27.637 --> 18:30.003
...I'll always be there for you...

18:30.206 --> 18:32.367
...as a friend and as your brother.

18:33.009 --> 18:34.499
Oh, Drake.

18:35.211 --> 18:36.508
Hard day, huh?

18:36.746 --> 18:39.214
First the medical award, now this?

18:39.682 --> 18:41.980
Some guys are just lucky, I guess.

18:43.219 --> 18:46.382
Dr. Ramoray, report to
first floor Emergency stat.

18:48.691 --> 18:49.715
Well, then...

18:50.926 --> 18:52.655
... I guess that's me.

18:55.097 --> 18:58.999
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

18:59.835 --> 19:01.735
They only said you.

19:04.006 --> 19:06.531
Oh, okay. All right.

19:06.842 --> 19:07.706
I love you.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.335
Yeah, whatever.

19:10.746 --> 19:11.770
Oh, no!

19:12.014 --> 19:13.345
Drake, look out!

19:17.953 --> 19:20.251
-Did they just kill off Joey?
-No!

19:22.725 --> 19:24.420
Now maybe.

19:25.961 --> 19:29.055
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

19:29.265 --> 19:30.698
I don't feel like talking!

19:30.933 --> 19:32.696
Come on! We care about you.

19:33.035 --> 19:37.131
-We're worried about you.
-And some of us really have to pee!

19:41.310 --> 19:42.800
I'm sorry, Joey.

19:44.980 --> 19:48.416
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

19:49.118 --> 19:52.417
-We came over as soon as we saw.
-How could you not tell us?

19:52.621 --> 19:56.421
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

19:57.827 --> 20:00.921
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

20:01.931 --> 20:06.265
They said that when they found my body,
my brain was so smashed in...

20:06.502 --> 20:10.097
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

20:11.907 --> 20:14.137
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

20:16.112 --> 20:17.807
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

20:18.013 --> 20:21.449
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

20:21.650 --> 20:24.813
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.682
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

20:29.158 --> 20:32.252
Here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

20:33.863 --> 20:37.321
I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

20:38.701 --> 20:40.362
What? To me, that's nice.

20:41.837 --> 20:43.771
It'll be okay. You know that.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.000
No, I don't.

20:47.309 --> 20:50.642
It's like you work
your whole life for something...

20:50.846 --> 20:52.973
...and you think
that when you get it...

20:53.215 --> 20:55.547
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

20:55.818 --> 20:57.513
But this so was.

20:57.953 --> 20:59.477
It changed everything.

20:59.722 --> 21:02.885
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

21:03.192 --> 21:05.456
...and I was pre-approved!

21:07.997 --> 21:11.364
I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

21:11.567 --> 21:13.125
I'm sorry, man.

21:13.335 --> 21:16.634
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

21:16.839 --> 21:19.467
... but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

21:20.743 --> 21:22.404
That means nothing to me.

21:29.985 --> 21:31.816
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

21:33.489 --> 21:34.854
Yeah, all right.

21:36.558 --> 21:37.490
Are these raisins?

21:38.961 --> 21:39.791
Sure, why not?

21:47.202 --> 21:48.533
Listen, Eddie.

21:50.172 --> 21:52.640
I've been thinking about
our living situation.

21:53.809 --> 21:54.741
Why are you smiling?

21:55.177 --> 21:58.340
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

21:59.081 --> 22:00.412
I named him...

22:00.649 --> 22:03.174
... Chandler, you know, after you.

22:12.361 --> 22:15.091
Well, that's not even a real fish.

22:16.431 --> 22:18.865
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

22:20.736 --> 22:22.397
So what's your point, man?

22:26.575 --> 22:28.440
Okay, good night.

22:29.378 --> 22:31.778
You big freak of nature!

22:58.207 --> 23:00.402
-Brisk tonight.
-Oh, man.

23:01.443 --> 23:03.934
-Let's never speak of this.
-You got it.
