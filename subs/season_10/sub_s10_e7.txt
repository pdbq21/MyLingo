WEBVTT

00:03.130 --> 00:05.647
Hey, you guys.
Hey, what are you doing?

00:05.813 --> 00:09.206
- Figuring out our wedding plans.
- Funny. We were doing the same thing.

00:10.818 --> 00:14.496
It's really crazy.
The hall, the dress, the food.

00:14.662 --> 00:18.340
- I had no idea how expensive this was.
- Yeah, it is really pricey.

00:18.506 --> 00:21.899
- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
- So, what did you two do about it?

00:22.069 --> 00:24.870
It was simple. I came up with
some cost-cutting solutions...

00:25.032 --> 00:28.745
...wrote out a list
and Monica told me to go to hell.

00:29.517 --> 00:33.399
There's no way around it. Just accept
that this is gonna cost a lot of money.

00:33.561 --> 00:36.874
I heard that weddings are, like,
a $40 billion-a-year industry.

00:37.044 --> 00:41.041
Yeah. And I'm responsible
for just, like, half of that.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.802
But really, it does seem like
this money could be put to better use.

00:44.972 --> 00:46.042
Are you serious?

00:46.213 --> 00:49.573
Yeah. How would you feel if we gave
all the wedding money to charity...

00:49.737 --> 00:51.775
...and we just got married
at City Hall?

00:51.939 --> 00:55.093
I think it would make me
wanna marry you even more.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.942
I gotta say, you guys,
that's an incredible gesture.

01:00.107 --> 01:02.749
Maybe you do that
next time you get married.

01:04.151 --> 01:08.114
No, no, no. The next time's
gonna be Hawaii at sunset.

01:08.275 --> 01:10.917
But maybe the time after that.

01:11.559 --> 01:13.631
The One With the Home Study

01:49.476 --> 01:51.947
- Hey. What's going on?
- Hey.

01:52.119 --> 01:55.593
Our adoption social worker is coming,
so we're cleaning the apartment.

01:55.843 --> 01:57.402
"We"?

01:58.085 --> 02:01.764
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.891
Is this the person who decides
whether or not you get a baby?

02:06.053 --> 02:09.287
- She's coming to see where we live.
- And it has to go perfectly.

02:09.456 --> 02:13.339
If she doesn't like us, she can keep
us off every adoption list in the state.

02:13.621 --> 02:16.900
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap opera fan.

02:17.064 --> 02:21.107
It's very impressive when
the little people know a celebrity.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.629
"Little people"?

02:22.950 --> 02:24.544
"Celebrity."

02:25.873 --> 02:27.547
So I think I'm just about done here.

02:27.715 --> 02:32.315
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden
somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?

02:32.479 --> 02:34.153
What?

02:35.202 --> 02:37.844
- No.
- Chandler.

02:40.207 --> 02:43.920
I don't, and I'm offended
by the insinuation.

02:44.091 --> 02:46.608
So there's not a magazine
under the couch...

02:46.774 --> 02:49.655
...or cigarettes taped to the back
of the toilet tank...

02:49.817 --> 02:52.253
...or a filthy video in the VCR?

02:53.260 --> 02:56.700
I'll admit the cigarettes and magazine.
But that tape is not mine.

02:56.864 --> 03:00.781
- It isn't mine.
- I guess we'll never know whose it is.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.505
May I help you?

03:09.677 --> 03:12.831
We're here to make a rather
sizable donation to the children.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.517
Any contribution, large or small,
is appreciated.

03:15.683 --> 03:18.644
I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.

03:18.806 --> 03:22.119
- Well, this is very generous.
- And we don't want any recognition.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.929
This is completely anonymous.

03:24.091 --> 03:26.562
Completely anonymous.
From two kind strangers.

03:26.734 --> 03:29.091
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.577
We can put your names
in our newsletter.

03:32.740 --> 03:35.495
- Not necessary.
- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.

03:36.784 --> 03:40.781
And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan."

03:41.428 --> 03:44.264
Well, on behalf of the children,
thank you both very much.

03:44.431 --> 03:48.554
- I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
- It does. It feels really good.

03:48.716 --> 03:51.186
Oh, look. And we get
these free T-shirts.

03:51.358 --> 03:54.478
Actually, that's the shirt
I wore to the gym.

03:54.842 --> 03:56.356
It's moist.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.969
- Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.
- Oh, good.

04:02.129 --> 04:06.365
Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.

04:06.534 --> 04:10.577
That's okay. I'm sure there are tons of
other beautiful paleontologists out there.

04:10.738 --> 04:13.413
- Absolutely.
- There was one. She's it.

04:13.581 --> 04:16.656
All the rest look like
they should live under a bridge.

04:19.146 --> 04:20.627
So, what are you gonna do today?

04:20.788 --> 04:23.179
I was thinking of taking Emma
to the playground.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.748
Oh, my God. What?

04:27.154 --> 04:31.675
Like I said, I was thinking of taking
Emma to the Museum of knives and Fire.

04:34.161 --> 04:39.719
Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
Emma going to the playground.

04:42.690 --> 04:43.840
Because...?

04:44.011 --> 04:47.610
All right, if you must know,
I had a traumatic...

04:47.775 --> 04:51.248
...swing incident when I was little.

04:52.099 --> 04:53.978
- Seriously?
- Yes. I was 4 years old.

04:54.141 --> 04:55.895
And I was on the swing...

04:56.063 --> 04:59.742
...and then all of a sudden my hair
got tangled in the chain.

05:01.549 --> 05:06.229
And to get me out, my mom had
to cut a big chunk of my hair.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.435
And it was uneven for weeks.

05:15.923 --> 05:18.998
And you made it through that?

05:19.727 --> 05:23.120
I wonder who's gonna play you
in the movie.

05:24.011 --> 05:27.724
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
I do not want Emma going there.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.411
And I was thinking Claire Danes.

05:31.378 --> 05:33.770
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your tragedy.

05:33.941 --> 05:37.540
But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.

05:37.705 --> 05:42.499
- You should come, and you'll see.
- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.902
And there's that moment
when you're at the top...

05:45.072 --> 05:48.751
...when you just don't know
if you're gonna return back to Earth.

05:50.277 --> 05:53.113
Space is filled with orbiting children.

05:56.163 --> 05:58.076
Look, please, just come on.

05:58.245 --> 06:01.798
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.766
- All right.
- Good.

06:05.933 --> 06:10.568
You don't wanna be a mom who passes
her irrational fears to her children.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.092
"Irrational," huh?

06:12.259 --> 06:15.892
I'll remember that next time you freak
out about a spider in your apartment.

06:16.063 --> 06:20.106
That's the same. I'm sure there are 30
different species of poisonous swings.

06:24.231 --> 06:26.269
Oh, my God.
The adoption lady is early.

06:26.433 --> 06:29.634
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

06:29.797 --> 06:30.992
Stand up straight.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.957
Big smile.

06:35.402 --> 06:38.124
Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?

06:38.285 --> 06:41.565
We're waiting for the adoption lady.
But I'm glad you're here.

06:41.729 --> 06:44.199
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.

06:44.371 --> 06:47.252
I don't know
if you wanna use it, but...

06:47.414 --> 06:50.409
Oh, this is so sweet of you.

06:50.578 --> 06:54.210
But I won't be needing a veil.
I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.182
I told you, I am not coming
to a naked wedding!

06:57.344 --> 06:59.542
No. We're not having a big reception.

06:59.707 --> 07:03.464
We took the wedding money
and donated it to a children's charity.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.190
That's crazy!

07:07.234 --> 07:11.277
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
my one wedding day like that.

07:11.438 --> 07:14.639
Well, we're different.
I don't care about having a huge party.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.954
This is really nice for you, but...

07:17.124 --> 07:20.598
Oh, please. I put this on
and I just look like...

07:20.768 --> 07:22.840
Well, radiant.

07:24.772 --> 07:28.564
All right, but who cares? I don't need
a pretty veil and a fancy dress.

07:28.736 --> 07:30.808
That's right.
You're making a commitment.

07:30.978 --> 07:34.132
You know, that's the same
whether you do it at the Plaza or...

07:34.301 --> 07:36.180
- Where you gonna do it?
- City Hall.

07:37.945 --> 07:40.746
Oh, that sounds nice.

07:40.908 --> 07:44.985
I was just there for jury duty.
They've really spruced that place up.

07:45.192 --> 07:49.588
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I've made my decision.

07:49.757 --> 07:52.398
What I really want
is a great big wedding.

07:54.642 --> 07:58.924
- But you gave all the money to charity.
- Well, I'll just ask for it back.

08:00.127 --> 08:02.438
- I don't think you can do that.
- Why not?

08:02.610 --> 08:06.687
This is her wedding day. That's way
more important than some stupid kids.

08:07.735 --> 08:11.174
That's sweet, honey, but save
something for the adoption lady.

08:17.505 --> 08:20.226
- All right, okay. Be careful.
- Okay.

08:20.387 --> 08:23.622
Careful. Watch her hair.
Watch her hair!

08:24.111 --> 08:27.345
- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
- I know. I know.

08:27.515 --> 08:32.468
But they're just so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.033
I promise you she's safe.
Watch how much she loves this.

08:36.203 --> 08:39.722
- Okay. Okay.
- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.842
Okay, careful. Okay.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.488
She's smiling.

08:49.657 --> 08:52.014
Look at that, she does like it.

08:52.179 --> 08:53.499
See, I told you.

08:58.706 --> 09:02.338
Oh, my God. Look at her,
she's a little daredevil.

09:02.550 --> 09:06.593
- Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
- Oh, absolutely.

09:06.754 --> 09:10.113
Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
It's in the diaper bag.

09:10.277 --> 09:11.632
Okay.

09:11.799 --> 09:15.272
See? Scared of the swings.
I bet you feel pretty silly.

09:20.648 --> 09:24.246
- We're asking for the money back?
- It's for our wedding day.

09:24.411 --> 09:28.408
Now, is this guy gay or straight?
Because one of us has to start flirting.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.778
You here to make another
donation the same day?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.977
I don't think that's ever
happened before.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.735
Gay. Go.

09:38.626 --> 09:41.347
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.

09:42.750 --> 09:47.111
The donation we made earlier?
Well, we want it back.

09:48.315 --> 09:49.385
Excuse me?

09:49.557 --> 09:52.870
Okay, that money was for a big wedding
we thought we didn't want.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.315
But it turns out we do.

09:54.481 --> 09:57.921
So you're asking us to refund
your donation to the children?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.766
Yeah.

10:01.008 --> 10:03.240
This feels really good.

10:06.333 --> 10:10.125
I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's
just really important to me.

10:10.297 --> 10:13.816
Hey, it's none of my business.
Besides, this is probably a good thing.

10:13.981 --> 10:18.422
We've really been spoiling the children,
what with all the food and warm clothing.

10:19.026 --> 10:21.987
That's not fair.
A person's wedding is important.

10:22.149 --> 10:23.709
And especially to me.

10:23.871 --> 10:27.504
I didn't have a graduation party.
And I didn't go to prom.

10:27.675 --> 10:31.273
And I spent my sweet 16
being chased around a tire yard...

10:31.438 --> 10:34.957
...by an escaped mental patient who,
in his own words, wanted to:

10:35.122 --> 10:36.716
"kill me, or whatever."

10:38.245 --> 10:41.081
So I deserve a real celebration.

10:41.248 --> 10:45.450
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty
little man make me feel badly about it.

10:49.737 --> 10:52.937
She could've been talking about
either one of us.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.106
Hi, I'm Laura.
I'm here for your adoption interview.

11:01.268 --> 11:03.739
Hi, I'm Monica.
And this is Chandler.

11:03.911 --> 11:06.029
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

11:06.193 --> 11:09.108
- Would you like something to drink?
- Water would be fine.

11:09.276 --> 11:11.348
We're so glad that you're here.

11:11.519 --> 11:14.035
We're excited about
getting this process started.

11:14.201 --> 11:17.082
Because we love kids.
Love them to death.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.524
Well, not actually to death.
That's just a figure of speech.

11:20.688 --> 11:22.840
We love kids the appropriate amount...

11:24.411 --> 11:26.609
...as allowed by law.

11:28.415 --> 11:30.568
- Your place is just lovely.
- Thank you.

11:30.738 --> 11:34.621
Yes, this building does have
a wholesome, family feel to it.

11:34.782 --> 11:39.018
I feel like I've been here before. Any
other couples in the building adopting?

11:39.186 --> 11:43.388
Is that that couple on the first floor?
We should get a baby before them.

11:43.551 --> 11:45.349
That guy tried to sell me drugs.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.387
But other than that,
wholesome, wholesome building.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.919
- What?
- I realized why I remember this place.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.155
- Really? What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing.

11:58.325 --> 12:02.447
I went on a date with a guy who lived
in this building. It didn't end very well.

12:02.610 --> 12:05.445
That wouldn't, by any chance,
be Joey Tribbiani?

12:05.653 --> 12:08.453
- Yes!
- Of course it was.

12:09.256 --> 12:13.412
We had a great night. In the morning,
he promised he'd call and he didn't.

12:13.581 --> 12:15.015
Rat bastard!

12:16.984 --> 12:19.501
- So you're not friends with him?
- Oh, God, no.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.739
- No, no, no.
- No. Nope.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.233
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.

12:31.398 --> 12:34.438
So are either one of you planning
on staying at home?

12:34.602 --> 12:39.202
Hello?
Anybody in there order a celebrity?

12:42.570 --> 12:43.640
What was that?

12:43.811 --> 12:47.284
That's just some crazy guy
who roams the halls here.

12:47.454 --> 12:49.287
He's great with kids, though.

12:56.624 --> 13:00.256
- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Son of a bitch!

13:04.031 --> 13:06.594
Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.

13:08.836 --> 13:11.477
Ross, see, I told you!
Those swings are evil!

13:11.639 --> 13:16.398
That's the last time Emma is getting on
one of those things for her entire life.

13:16.564 --> 13:19.957
No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't
the swing's fault. It was my fault.

13:20.127 --> 13:23.042
And kind of that kid's fault.

13:23.250 --> 13:26.086
Who is still laughing. Nice.

13:26.293 --> 13:29.733
Come on. Can we just get out of here
before somebody else gets hurt?

13:29.897 --> 13:32.972
No. Wait. I have an idea.
I want you to get on the swing...

13:33.140 --> 13:36.374
...and you'll see that there's
nothing to be afraid of.

13:38.826 --> 13:41.388
I know what this is all about.

13:41.829 --> 13:45.063
You've always been jealous of my hair.

13:45.513 --> 13:49.429
I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you should get over your silly fears.

13:49.597 --> 13:51.669
- All right, fine. I'll do it.
- Good.

13:51.839 --> 13:54.800
- If you hold a spider.
- Where?! Where?!

13:55.402 --> 13:57.794
If you hold a spider.

13:57.965 --> 13:59.559
I know.

14:06.293 --> 14:08.890
Guys, is everything okay?
It's me, Joey.

14:11.619 --> 14:13.338
Adoption!

14:14.862 --> 14:16.262
What's going on?

14:16.463 --> 14:18.900
Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...

14:19.066 --> 14:22.379
...Bert, roaming the halls.

14:22.550 --> 14:25.670
- Guys?
- keep on roaming, Bert!

14:25.833 --> 14:28.589
We don't want any crazy today!

14:29.116 --> 14:32.829
- What's going on?
- We'll talk later! Everything's fine!

14:33.561 --> 14:35.997
Everything doesn't sound fine.

14:36.203 --> 14:38.400
Is he all right out there by himself?

14:38.566 --> 14:41.686
Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
His older brother...

14:41.889 --> 14:42.959
...Ernie.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.926
- Bert and Ernie?
- You can't make this stuff up.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.019
You never told me about that guy
and your sweet 16.

14:54.181 --> 14:56.618
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, it ended okay.

14:56.784 --> 14:58.936
One of my friends shot him.

15:00.347 --> 15:03.980
At least you'll get a proper wedding.
You really deserve that.

15:04.151 --> 15:08.034
Yeah, I really do.
You know, I had nothing growing up.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.640
Just like the kids
I took the money from.

15:12.800 --> 15:17.400
No. No, no. I see where this is going.
Don't make me go back there.

15:18.405 --> 15:22.322
Look, I can't have a wedding
with this money now. It's tainted.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.844
Fine, we'll give the money back.

15:25.012 --> 15:27.369
If that guy at the charity
gives us a hard time...

15:27.535 --> 15:30.689
...my friend hasn't shot anyone
in a really long time.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.859
I must say this seems like a lovely
environment to raise a child in.

15:36.023 --> 15:38.665
You are welcome to look
under any of the furniture...

15:38.826 --> 15:42.299
...because, believe me, you won't find
any porn or cigarettes under there.

15:43.190 --> 15:47.632
Before we look around, let me make sure
I have everything I need up to here.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.643
Why don't I show you the baby's room.

16:00.247 --> 16:02.285
- What are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me in.

16:02.449 --> 16:04.682
- I thought you were in trouble.
- Well, we're not.

16:04.852 --> 16:07.004
But you called me "Bert."

16:07.494 --> 16:09.567
That's our code word for danger.

16:10.618 --> 16:14.330
- We don't have a code word.
- We don't?

16:14.502 --> 16:16.095
We really should.

16:16.263 --> 16:20.260
From now on, "Bert"
will be our code word for danger.

16:20.427 --> 16:22.864
So that was the baby's room.

16:24.471 --> 16:28.708
- What room should we see next?
- Any room that isn't behind this couch.

16:30.518 --> 16:34.196
Some people don't get him,
but I think he's really funny.

16:40.848 --> 16:43.444
I did not care for that.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.247
You have to leave.

16:45.412 --> 16:48.134
You slept with our social worker
and never called her back.

16:48.295 --> 16:50.288
She is still pissed,
so she can't see you.

16:50.457 --> 16:52.211
Okay, okay.

16:55.022 --> 16:57.698
- What?
- I forgot my bat.

17:00.347 --> 17:02.226
Oh, my God.

17:02.389 --> 17:06.386
And for the last time,
we do not want to be friends with you!

17:08.716 --> 17:11.437
And we don't wanna buy your bat!

17:12.680 --> 17:14.433
What are you doing here?

17:14.602 --> 17:17.243
Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.

17:20.728 --> 17:24.041
- Are you friends with him?
- I can explain.

17:24.732 --> 17:26.246
Joey?

17:26.974 --> 17:28.807
All right. Okay.

17:32.860 --> 17:35.661
You have got some nerve
coming back here.

17:37.384 --> 17:39.981
- I can't believe you never called me.
- Excuse me?

17:40.427 --> 17:44.060
You probably don't even remember
my name. It's Joey, by the way.

17:44.231 --> 17:48.433
And don't bother telling me yours,
because I totally remember it, lady.

17:50.878 --> 17:52.871
I waited weeks for you to call me.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.078
I gave you my number.
You never called me.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.280
Don't try to turn this around on me.

17:57.444 --> 18:01.282
I am not some kind of social work...

18:01.448 --> 18:02.929
...that you can just...

18:03.090 --> 18:04.490
...do.

18:07.414 --> 18:11.617
- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
- Really? Think about it. Come on.

18:11.779 --> 18:15.138
You're a beautiful woman.
Smart, funny.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.660
We had a really good time.

18:18.986 --> 18:21.583
If I had your number,
why wouldn't I call you?

18:22.149 --> 18:23.265
I don't know.

18:25.513 --> 18:27.506
Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

18:27.675 --> 18:32.309
Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
You broke my heart.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.873
You know how many women
I had to sleep with to get over you?

18:38.846 --> 18:40.839
- Joey, wait...
- No!

18:41.008 --> 18:43.889
I waited a long time!
I can't wait anymore.

18:47.254 --> 18:50.010
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
I'm so embarrassed.

18:50.177 --> 18:53.252
- Oh, that's really okay.
- Yeah. We totally understand.

18:53.420 --> 18:56.973
- Dating is hard.
- Boy, you people are nice.

18:58.626 --> 19:00.345
And I've got to say...

19:00.508 --> 19:04.140
...I think you're going to make
excellent parents.

19:07.515 --> 19:08.835
Laura!

19:15.683 --> 19:17.402
We're back.

19:18.245 --> 19:20.317
Are you here to take more money?

19:20.487 --> 19:23.084
Because I think what you're
looking for is an ATM.

19:23.691 --> 19:25.843
No, no, we're here
to give the money back.

19:26.013 --> 19:29.726
Yeah. Because you know what?
It's all about the children.

19:29.937 --> 19:32.453
Although it's also about the wedding.

19:34.021 --> 19:36.378
All right, here. No. Oh, God.

19:36.544 --> 19:40.222
If I haven't said so already,
sir, congratulations.

19:40.427 --> 19:42.385
Okay, look, enough, all right?

19:42.550 --> 19:44.428
I'm stepping in
and putting my foot down.

19:44.592 --> 19:48.110
As your future husband,
I'm gonna make this decision for us.

19:49.076 --> 19:51.433
What do you think we should do?

19:52.119 --> 19:55.273
- It's not your decision anymore.
- What?

19:55.442 --> 19:58.563
On behalf of the children of New York,
I reject your money.

19:59.286 --> 20:02.167
- But we're giving you this.
- And I'm giving it back to you.

20:02.329 --> 20:05.130
Come on. Consider it a contribution.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.770
Well, this is very generous.

20:08.936 --> 20:13.456
Take the check. Have a great wedding
and a wonderful life together.

20:13.621 --> 20:16.536
Sounds good to me. We can save up,
come back in a few years...

20:16.704 --> 20:18.423
...and make an even bigger donation.

20:18.586 --> 20:20.339
And when you do, ask for Brian.

20:20.508 --> 20:21.737
- Oh, is that you?
- No.

20:27.274 --> 20:28.550
Hello?

20:29.476 --> 20:31.196
Oh, hi.

20:32.119 --> 20:35.877
Oh, my God, really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler.

20:36.043 --> 20:37.683
Okay. Goodbye.

20:38.125 --> 20:41.565
- Wrong number?
- That was Laura.

20:41.729 --> 20:44.883
She gave us a great report and
we're officially on the waiting list.

20:45.052 --> 20:47.363
- That's great.
- Now we just wait for a call...

20:47.535 --> 20:50.894
...and someone tells us
there's a baby waiting for us.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.070
Hello?

21:04.752 --> 21:06.345
Have you seen Joey's bat?

21:12.960 --> 21:15.317
Okay. I got a spider.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.715
There were two,
I picked the bigger one.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.477
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:24.852 --> 21:26.845
This feels perfectly normal.

21:28.055 --> 21:30.332
Okay, get on the swing.

21:32.179 --> 21:33.660
Okay.

21:34.542 --> 21:36.660
Okay.

21:42.229 --> 21:43.584
Okay.

21:51.038 --> 21:53.601
- See?
- All right. I can do this.

21:53.761 --> 21:55.515
There you go. Good for you.

21:55.683 --> 21:58.040
You know what?
I'm getting used to this little guy.

21:58.205 --> 22:01.599
- I don't even feel him in here anymore.
- That's because he's on your neck.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.523
