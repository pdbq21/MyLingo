WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:05.994
Are you still on hold?

00:06.205 --> 00:08.673
I was supposed to call my dad back <br/>two hours ago.

00:08.441 --> 00:09.874
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:10.076 --> 00:13.045
Call him as soon as you get a chance. <br/>He's at Flimbees.

00:13.546 --> 00:14.535
What's Flimbees?

00:14.714 --> 00:17.774
That's the word I use when <br/>I can't remember the real thing.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.651
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.982
No. That's what they want me to do.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.886
My warranty expires tomorrow. <br/>If I don't get through...

00:27.093 --> 00:29.755
...they won't fix my crappy, <br/>broken phone for free!

00:29.996 --> 00:32.157
We cannot let them win! <br/>It's us versus them!

00:32.399 --> 00:33.730
Yes!

00:34.968 --> 00:35.957
I say hang up.

00:36.136 --> 00:39.867
It's Chandler and us <br/>versus Monica and them.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.065
- Hey. <br/>- Hey.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.336
I gotta double-check for tickets <br/>tonight. Who got what?

00:45.612 --> 00:46.601
I have one.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.214
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:49.582 --> 00:50.776
My boyfriend.

00:52.852 --> 00:54.945
I have a boyfriend now.

00:55.422 --> 00:56.946
Two it is. How about you?

00:58.291 --> 01:00.225
Yeah, I also need two.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.892
Really? Who's number two?

01:03.129 --> 01:07.589
Whose Number Two? One of the more <br/>difficult games sewer workers play.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.696
No one, it's just this person.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.732
Like a date-type person?

01:13.973 --> 01:16.635
Yeah, kind of. <br/>It's this woman from work.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.777
I hope that won't be too weird. <br/>Will it, Rach?

01:21.214 --> 01:24.274
Not at all. I was actually <br/>gonna bring someone myself.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.844
But you said one ticket.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.524
I meant me plus one.

01:33.059 --> 01:35.687
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

01:37.897 --> 01:39.728
All right. I'll see you tonight.

01:39.966 --> 01:40.955
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.190
Bye-bye.

01:43.069 --> 01:44.229
Okay, I need a date!

01:46.239 --> 01:49.697
Oh, hey! You guys are finally <br/>gonna get to meet Kate!

01:49.909 --> 01:52.469
And I borrowed your cologne. <br/>I hope she likes it.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.374
What are you doing? <br/>She's seeing somebody.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.913
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

01:58.751 --> 02:02.380
- Bottle next to the shaving cream. <br/>- Worm medicine for the duck.

02:06.893 --> 02:09.259
The One With the Screamer

02:52.005 --> 02:56.271
- Here you go. You can wear this. <br/>- Thanks. Okay.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.075
I'm setting the phone down.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.646
But I'm still here.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.015
Just don't go anywhere. <br/>I'm still here.

03:06.553 --> 03:10.614
Don't switch or anything, because <br/>I'm right here. Just one sec.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.151
One sec. One second!

03:14.661 --> 03:16.891
Wait! One second! Just...

03:17.597 --> 03:19.588
What? Monica, I'm scared!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.897
Honey, that's a sleeve.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.664
And we also have a speakerphone.

03:26.906 --> 03:30.103
Please stay on the line. <br/>Your call is important to us.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.401
You gotta hang up. <br/>We'll be late.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.274
Thank you for your patience. <br/>You're the next caller.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.948
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

03:38.451 --> 03:40.942
You were gonna have me hang up.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.787
Can you take a duck and a chick <br/>to the theater?

03:47.894 --> 03:48.883
Of course not.

03:49.429 --> 03:52.227
I just wanted them to hear it <br/>from somebody else.

03:54.834 --> 03:58.270
All right, fellas, back to Nintendo.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.173
Oh, hi, how are you?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.506
Good.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.286
- Looks like we're the first ones here. <br/>- Looks that way.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.680
First ones here!

04:19.292 --> 04:21.920
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross. <br/>Ross, Tommy.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.426
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin. <br/>Cailin...

04:24.697 --> 04:25.686
Sorry.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.358
And break!

04:31.638 --> 04:34.129
I think I'm gonna run <br/>to the ladies' room.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.570
- I'll join you. <br/>- I'll get our seats.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.435
Well, this is...

04:40.647 --> 04:41.773
...awkward.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.145
Well, because Rachel and I <br/>used to go out.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.080
Oh, I didn't know that.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.086
Well, then this is awkward.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.352
- So, what do you? <br/>- I think we're here.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.599
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.996
I think you may be in our seats.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.362
No, I don't think so.

05:07.607 --> 05:10.167
- Could we take a look at your ticket? <br/>- Sure.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.841
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13"...

05:16.015 --> 05:17.676
Oh, well, I thought that...

05:17.884 --> 05:21.513
You thought? Well, that didn't <br/>really work out for you. Idiot!

05:23.222 --> 05:26.714
What are you, a moron? <br/>It says, "D-13"! Okay?

05:27.060 --> 05:30.086
You're surrounded by even numbers! <br/>Does that give you a clue?

05:30.563 --> 05:33.293
- The usher told me... <br/>- The usher must be right!

05:33.633 --> 05:35.328
With all his training!

05:35.802 --> 05:36.928
Get out!

05:37.837 --> 05:38.826
Here!

05:42.608 --> 05:45.133
- Hey, man, you want the aisle? <br/>- No, I'm good.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.358
- There he is! <br/>- There's our star!

05:59.659 --> 06:01.183
You were great!

06:01.394 --> 06:02.656
So? What'd you think?

06:02.962 --> 06:06.864
Almost as good as the play with <br/>the two naked girls on the seesaw.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.734
- I wasn't in that. <br/>- I know.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.968
I want you to meet everybody. <br/>Everybody, this is Kate.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.640
Excuse me. Excuse me. <br/>Sweetheart!

06:19.579 --> 06:20.568
Come!

06:24.417 --> 06:26.647
So that's the girl you like.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.483
I tell you, this guy <br/>Rachel is with is crazy.

06:31.758 --> 06:36.525
He viciously screamed at total <br/>strangers. I think he's bad news.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.591
Wait a minute. You don't like <br/>the guy Rachel's dating?

06:42.034 --> 06:43.160
Well, that's odd.

06:44.704 --> 06:48.765
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is <br/>Kate's understudy, Lauren.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.032
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

06:51.277 --> 06:54.007
I ran into you in the hallway <br/>in your building.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.115
It was right after I slept with Joey. <br/>He dumped me the next day.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.854
So how'd you guys meet?

07:02.722 --> 07:06.089
The short version is, I pursued <br/>her for a couple of months.

07:06.392 --> 07:09.418
Then I gave her a check for $20,000 <br/>and she was mine.

07:11.164 --> 07:15.726
In the long version, I dump him <br/>for telling people the short version.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.903
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

07:20.573 --> 07:22.598
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.036
How do you do?

07:24.243 --> 07:27.303
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

07:27.847 --> 07:29.940
Do they have representation?

07:30.917 --> 07:32.646
They weren't in the play.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.316
We're not actors.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.609
What a shame!

07:35.988 --> 07:40.118
With her face and her chest, <br/>I could really put something together.

07:42.361 --> 07:43.794
Could I borrow it?

07:46.199 --> 07:48.099
Hi. Remember me?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.463
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line <br/>for the bathroom...

07:51.704 --> 07:54.764
...and someone just cut. <br/>I think he's gonna snap.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.603
I'm gonna go.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.274
Go? Why?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.277
I don't know. Could be <br/>because I don't feel like...

08:02.548 --> 08:05.676
...waiting all night for a guy <br/>who may or may not scream.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.348
He definitely will scream.

08:11.691 --> 08:12.817
Goodbye.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.655
Here we go, people!

08:25.204 --> 08:26.694
"Boxing Day.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.574
The Lucille Lortel Theatre...

08:31.711 --> 08:36.341
Joey Tribbiani gives <br/>an uneven performance.

08:36.849 --> 08:40.046
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst <br/>thing in this production."

08:40.253 --> 08:41.311
Yes!

08:45.057 --> 08:49.426
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered <br/>portrayal is laughable."

08:50.763 --> 08:52.993
Here it is! "The direction...

08:53.232 --> 08:56.497
...by Marshall Townend is..."

09:02.742 --> 09:04.369
Thank you, boys and girls.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.272
You've ruined my life.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.005
Please stuff your talentless faces...

09:11.250 --> 09:13.616
...with my mother's crab cakes!

09:14.554 --> 09:15.782
Excuse me!

09:21.594 --> 09:23.562
Does anyone mind if I save this?

09:29.135 --> 09:30.966
- Is the play over? <br/>- Where were you?

09:31.537 --> 09:35.234
Thank you for your patience. <br/>You're the next caller.

09:35.608 --> 09:39.135
You were "the next caller" hours ago. <br/>You must be going crazy.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.573
I've kept myself busy.

09:50.056 --> 09:54.220
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in <br/>her room and her stuff in your room.

10:00.366 --> 10:01.355
You okay?

10:02.635 --> 10:03.624
Fabulous.

10:03.869 --> 10:08.738
Drama critics, they're nothing but <br/>people who couldn't make it as actors.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.307
- You know what to do? <br/>- Become a drama critic.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.647
I am hurt!

10:20.653 --> 10:22.018
A plague...

10:22.388 --> 10:24.583
...on both your houses!

10:27.226 --> 10:30.753
By the way, he dumped me tonight <br/>after he read my review.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.760
Oh, classy.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.868
I sure know how to pick them.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.597
You know I gave up a part <br/>on a soap for this?

10:44.176 --> 10:45.438
I gave up a job too.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.947
- Really? What? <br/>- Declawing cats.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.645
Hey, tell you what, <br/>let me walk you home.

10:53.886 --> 10:58.050
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn <br/>every copy of The Times and The Post.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.655
- Why The Post? <br/>- You didn't see The Post?

11:00.893 --> 11:03.657
- No. You? <br/>- No. Why?

11:11.137 --> 11:14.038
You really think these newspapers <br/>are just jealous of me?

11:14.240 --> 11:17.573
Absolutely. You're talented <br/>and you're good-looking.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.569
You're sweet and cute.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.212
I know. That's why they trashed me.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.548
- Wait. Wait a minute. <br/>- What?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.357
I don't get you.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.553
I mean, first you hate me.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.493
Then you sleep with me.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.768
Then you want nothing to do with me. <br/>Now you want me again?

11:45.004 --> 11:47.564
You never went out <br/>with an actress before?

11:49.075 --> 11:51.771
Kate, do you even like me?

11:54.680 --> 11:58.275
- Of course I do. <br/>- So how come you blew me off?

11:58.517 --> 12:01.918
- How come you were with him? <br/>- I don't know.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.351
I just do this.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.882
I always have to pick, like, <br/>the smartest guy...

12:08.127 --> 12:09.719
...or the most talented guy.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.463
Why can't I just <br/>pick someone like you?

12:16.702 --> 12:17.794
Thanks.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.729
You know what I mean.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.075
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.274
You're just so...

12:30.616 --> 12:31.742
You're so...

12:33.085 --> 12:34.052
...so...

12:45.898 --> 12:48.560
Here we go. <br/>Let's get your feet up there.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.807
Good night.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.343
Sweet dreams.

13:07.153 --> 13:10.611
I'm gonna put this can right here <br/>in case you have to hurl.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.959
Please stay on the line. <br/>Your call is very important to us.

13:23.035 --> 13:26.368
You've been up for 24 hours. <br/>Go to sleep.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.799
This isn't healthy.

13:28.007 --> 13:29.702
No, no, I'm fine.

13:29.942 --> 13:33.343
And you know why? <br/>Because of all the riboflavin.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.775
Didn't you have that on last night?

13:41.620 --> 13:43.611
I stayed at Kate's <br/>but nothing happened.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.619
Yeah, last time I was <br/>at Pete's we just watched a movie...

13:47.793 --> 13:49.693
...of us...

13:51.997 --> 13:53.487
...that we'd made earlier.

13:53.899 --> 13:57.266
I'm sorry, I can't help it. <br/>I have a boyfriend.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.261
Hey, where were you?

14:00.506 --> 14:04.272
I'm so, so sorry. <br/>I am definitely gonna see your play.

14:04.577 --> 14:08.013
I swear, your play is very important <br/>to us. Thank you for your patience.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.183
Your play is the next play <br/>I'm gonna see.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.383
How'd it go with Kate?

14:14.553 --> 14:15.542
It was great!

14:15.721 --> 14:20.385
I walked her home, and it was <br/>amazing how much we connected.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.026
Then she passed out.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.023
But then she woke up.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.662
And we stayed up all night talking.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.061
And now we're crazy about each other!

14:30.736 --> 14:32.135
You had "the night"!

14:33.239 --> 14:36.265
When two people realize <br/>their feelings for each other...

14:36.475 --> 14:40.036
...and they talk for hours and learn <br/>all about the other person.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.303
You think?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.448
- Did you learn about her family? <br/>- Two brothers. One died!

14:44.617 --> 14:45.606
Yes!

14:52.825 --> 14:54.816
This is from the woman at the bar.

14:59.598 --> 15:02.328
Sorry. She thought <br/>you were somebody else.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.438
- What time is it? <br/>- One.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.107
7:15.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.575
Watch doesn't work.

15:12.845 --> 15:16.110
Tommy's supposed to be here soon. <br/>We're going to lunch.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.452
Look, I wasn't gonna <br/>say anything to you, but...

15:21.655 --> 15:25.318
All right, I don't think <br/>you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.688
You don't?

15:27.928 --> 15:32.262
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean. <br/>I think you should stay away from him.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.799
Or maybe I should stay away <br/>from all men.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.535
It's not just because I'm jealous.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.642
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.771
Look, the guy actually screamed <br/>at this couple sitting in our seats.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.381
Yeah, and at the end of the play...

15:51.818 --> 15:56.619
...he got up, and he just started, <br/>like, banging his hands together.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.653
You don't want to believe me, <br/>that's fine.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.021
We're kidding.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.993
No one believe me. <br/>I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

16:09.302 --> 16:12.203
- Sorry, Tommy. <br/>- What's in the cup?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.035
What is in the cup?

16:16.242 --> 16:17.334
Okay, it's coffee.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.842
Iced coffee? <br/>Tell me it's iced coffee.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.039
- It's hot... <br/>- Hot coffee!

16:24.651 --> 16:28.143
You idiot! You gonna spill <br/>hot coffee all over me, huh?

16:28.388 --> 16:32.882
What are you? Just a big, stupid <br/>doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.764
What's your favorite thing <br/>about summertime?

16:40.066 --> 16:44.059
Going to the beach <br/>when it stays light real late.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.170
What's your favorite thing <br/>about summer?

16:52.178 --> 16:55.341
I don't know. Probably the smell <br/>of freshly cut grass.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.376
That's a good one.

17:02.222 --> 17:06.352
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and <br/>my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.191
We held the curtain for you. <br/>Let's go!

17:14.634 --> 17:17.694
Vic! Where have you been, baby?

17:21.975 --> 17:22.942
Where's Kate?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.542
She got a job in L.A.

17:27.414 --> 17:32.283
I've been waiting up all night <br/>for you. Where have you been?

17:33.153 --> 17:35.587
Where have you been, Vic?

17:37.590 --> 17:41.549
Go to the window. I wanna run down <br/>to the truck and show you something.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.262
What do you got down there, Vic?

17:46.499 --> 17:49.059
What do you got under that tarp?

17:52.105 --> 17:53.197
When is she leaving?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.168
Tonight. What are you doing?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.006
I'm coming up!

18:03.450 --> 18:07.147
Hey, you hanging in there?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.517
You doing okay?

18:10.690 --> 18:13.181
You listening to me?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.020
Okay.

18:15.195 --> 18:19.495
If Pete calls again, <br/>and you don't put him through...

18:19.666 --> 18:21.827
...I will kill you.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.231
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

18:29.576 --> 18:32.204
Use ours across the hall <br/>because she...

18:32.512 --> 18:33.843
...has problems.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.069
Thanks.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.140
Sorry, Tommy.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.183
I almost spilled this <br/>hot coffee on you.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.950
Yeah, but you didn't.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.418
No, but...

18:46.993 --> 18:48.187
...it's hot.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.592
Would you stop it? <br/>It's getting really old.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.769
I can't believe no one believes me.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.627
I do. I believe you.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.027
You do?

19:00.306 --> 19:03.639
Yeah. But I also believed her <br/>when she said I was next.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.276
Hey there, little fella.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.818
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

19:20.193 --> 19:21.160
Gross!

19:21.728 --> 19:22.717
Idiot!

19:23.796 --> 19:26.731
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

19:27.000 --> 19:30.868
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute! <br/>I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"

19:31.137 --> 19:33.628
You're so stupid! <br/>How are you not yet extinct?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.472
What are you quacking about?

19:38.912 --> 19:40.539
Dumb Donald Dodo!

19:44.651 --> 19:46.983
Step away from the duck.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.482
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.683
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

19:57.764 --> 19:59.925
I guess we're not going out anymore.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.190
Man!

20:05.638 --> 20:09.438
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you. <br/>I couldn't find you before.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.709
What's all this about L. A?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.979
They still want me <br/>for General Hospital.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.169
But...

20:15.615 --> 20:16.980
...what about us?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.376
Last night was wonderful.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.513
But I can't stay here just for you.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.625
So stay for the museums.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.723
- I'm sorry. <br/>- Joey, on-stage!

20:30.463 --> 20:32.556
At least stay till the end <br/>of the play.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.632
I'll go to the airport with you. <br/>I want to say goodbye.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.301
Where are you, Vic?

20:37.804 --> 20:40.068
Flight's in an hour. <br/>I gotta go.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.671
Vic?

20:41.975 --> 20:42.964
Vic?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.241
- Vic! <br/>- In a minute!

20:48.915 --> 20:51.315
So this is it, Victor?

20:52.218 --> 20:54.413
Yeah. I guess it is.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.451
Listen...

21:04.330 --> 21:08.130
...I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say <br/>it quick because this is killing me.

21:08.735 --> 21:13.331
One thing you gotta know <br/>is that I will never forget you.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.440
But you got things <br/>you have to do now.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.236
And so do I.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.437
And so...

21:23.916 --> 21:26.350
...I'm gonna get on <br/>this spaceship...

21:33.760 --> 21:38.094
...and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7 <br/>in search of alternative fuels.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.298
But when I return <br/>200 years from now...

21:42.835 --> 21:45.030
...you'll be long gone...

21:45.672 --> 21:47.697
...but I won't have aged at all.

21:51.277 --> 21:54.769
So you tell your great, <br/>great granddaughter...

21:55.148 --> 21:56.376
...to look me up.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.850
Because, Adrianne...

22:00.653 --> 22:01.642
...baby...

22:03.956 --> 22:06.015
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.528
So long, Vic!

22:22.342 --> 22:24.810
It's been two days.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.569
Yeah, I know.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.172
Good thing it's one of those <br/>801 numbers, right?

22:30.483 --> 22:35.420
Phoebe, 800 is toll free. <br/>801 is Utah.

22:37.957 --> 22:42.587
It has to be 800 because all those <br/>big companies have 800 numbers.

22:42.829 --> 22:43.818
Every...

22:44.797 --> 22:48.130
Yeah, every big Utah-based company <br/>has one.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.494
Sorry. I'm so sorry. <br/>I will pay you back.

22:53.106 --> 22:55.802
And yet she's still not <br/>hanging up the phone.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.669
- Hang up! <br/>- Hang up the phone!

22:57.977 --> 22:59.376
Fine! Fine!

23:06.886 --> 23:08.683
Well, I think I broke it.

23:11.290 --> 23:15.351
But that's all right. <br/>Here's the number where you can call.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.017
