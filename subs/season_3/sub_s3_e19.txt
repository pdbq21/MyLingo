WEBVTT

00:03.076 --> 00:05.840
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:07.347 --> 00:08.473
Say, Rachel...

00:08.749 --> 00:11.775
...I was wondering if you'd like to
go to a movie with me sometime...

00:11.985 --> 00:13.543
...as my lover.

00:16.857 --> 00:17.949
Too out there.

00:18.125 --> 00:21.094
Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...

00:22.029 --> 00:23.792
...as my lover.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.557
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:27.734 --> 00:29.133
All right, let's go shopping.

00:29.303 --> 00:32.739
I got a positive balance on my credit card
I want to use before Citibank goes under.

00:32.906 --> 00:35.340
Good idea. Good idea.

00:35.809 --> 00:38.778
Before we go, you know,
there's something I need to say.

00:38.946 --> 00:41.744
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

00:44.284 --> 00:46.946
I've kind of had this crush on you.

00:47.754 --> 00:50.985
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

00:51.158 --> 00:54.787
But now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

00:55.696 --> 00:57.823
So that's what I'm doing...

00:57.998 --> 00:59.898
...now.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.669
Wow.

01:15.282 --> 01:16.715
I dropped a cup.

01:19.620 --> 01:20.746
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt

02:05.599 --> 02:08.432
You know, that's why within
a few years, voice recognition...

02:08.702 --> 02:11.227
...is gonna be pretty much
standard on any computer.

02:11.405 --> 02:15.899
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car." "Clean my room."

02:16.143 --> 02:20.045
It won't be able to do any of those things,
but it'll understand what you're saying.

02:20.213 --> 02:24.650
Wow. Would it be able to recognize
my voice if I talked like this?

02:25.385 --> 02:28.479
Oh, yeah. It'll understand you,
but it's gonna make fun of you.

02:30.624 --> 02:31.955
Oh, this was so great.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.888
Yeah, it was.

02:35.162 --> 02:37.027
All right, then.

02:37.798 --> 02:39.231
Bye.

02:45.005 --> 02:46.768
Hello, people who do not live here.

02:51.979 --> 02:54.311
I gave you a key for emergencies.

02:54.481 --> 02:56.574
We were out of Doritos.

02:58.151 --> 03:00.881
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

03:01.088 --> 03:04.216
Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

03:05.092 --> 03:07.720
Third wife sold separately.

03:07.894 --> 03:10.863
He's great. I mean, we have
such a good time together.

03:11.031 --> 03:16.094
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all!

03:16.503 --> 03:18.300
- Still?
- No.

03:18.472 --> 03:22.135
It's driving me crazy. In every
other way, he's the perfect guy.

03:22.342 --> 03:26.369
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

03:26.947 --> 03:30.144
Life-sized Imperial Stormtroopers
from Sharper Image?

03:30.350 --> 03:31.817
Two.

03:32.252 --> 03:34.584
Wow. Can Joey and I put
them on and fight?

03:37.024 --> 03:41.120
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy

03:41.294 --> 03:45.788
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy

03:49.670 --> 03:52.867
I guess he must've gotten
the part in that play.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.807
Either that, or Gloria Estefan was right.
Eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.

04:03.717 --> 04:06.515
- Joe, how's it going?
- Good.

04:10.624 --> 04:12.615
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:13.393 --> 04:15.054
So you're playing Adrienne?

04:15.228 --> 04:17.788
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

04:20.033 --> 04:23.560
No. I'm playing your husband, Victor.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

04:23.837 --> 04:26.169
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Kate Miller.

04:32.979 --> 04:35.607
So the play's pretty great, huh?

04:35.782 --> 04:38.250
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

04:38.418 --> 04:40.045
She's so incisive when it comes...

04:40.220 --> 04:42.654
...to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

04:42.823 --> 04:45.121
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!

04:50.731 --> 04:52.062
Where do I know you from?

04:54.301 --> 04:56.701
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

04:57.404 --> 04:58.837
Days of Our Lives?

04:59.272 --> 05:02.070
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?

05:03.310 --> 05:04.334
No, that's not it.

05:06.012 --> 05:07.877
So you're a soap actor.

05:08.115 --> 05:11.346
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play.

05:11.518 --> 05:14.351
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

05:15.689 --> 05:16.883
That infomercial!

05:18.692 --> 05:21.058
For the milk-carton-spout thing!

05:21.294 --> 05:23.922
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk!

05:25.465 --> 05:29.697
See, I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.565
Now, see, that's acting.

05:32.239 --> 05:34.139
Right. At the end,
you choked on a cookie.

05:35.242 --> 05:36.368
Yeah, that was real.

05:38.545 --> 05:41.981
- I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
- I know.

05:42.149 --> 05:43.946
So, what are you gonna tell him?

05:44.117 --> 05:48.178
Well, I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.

05:50.490 --> 05:53.721
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

05:56.363 --> 05:59.696
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there...

05:59.866 --> 06:04.235
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...

06:04.437 --> 06:08.134
...which I'm allowed to do,
and I felt guilty.

06:08.308 --> 06:10.469
Like I'd be cheating
on Ross or something.

06:11.111 --> 06:14.239
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...

06:14.447 --> 06:18.383
...that you're not over Ross yet,
and you have issues with your father.

06:22.222 --> 06:26.124
- I don't have any issues with my father.
- Okay, so it's probably the Ross thing.

06:28.395 --> 06:30.363
I hate this woman! I hate her!

06:30.564 --> 06:33.226
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...

06:33.400 --> 06:36.392
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks!

06:36.670 --> 06:41.004
Okay, and whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me!

06:43.844 --> 06:46.108
- Hello.
- Hey.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.804
So Rachel called.

06:49.182 --> 06:51.275
Wants to see me.

06:52.085 --> 06:54.246
Going over in a minute.

06:54.421 --> 06:59.017
- Wow. What do you think she wants?
- Maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

06:59.192 --> 07:02.218
...and she realizes that life
without me...

07:02.596 --> 07:03.654
...sucks.

07:04.731 --> 07:08.861
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

07:10.904 --> 07:12.667
Just trying to be supportive.

07:13.740 --> 07:15.674
Be supportive like a guy.

07:16.676 --> 07:18.473
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

07:22.782 --> 07:25.512
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:26.086 --> 07:29.852
You wanted to see me?

07:32.325 --> 07:33.952
Yeah.

07:34.728 --> 07:37.856
Here's a box of your stuff.

07:39.866 --> 07:42.198
- What?
- You know, it's just, like, hats...

07:42.369 --> 07:45.930
...and a shirt and CDs.
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.

07:46.106 --> 07:49.564
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt me or something?

07:50.110 --> 07:51.975
No.

07:52.746 --> 07:54.771
Ross, it...

07:55.482 --> 07:59.384
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

07:59.619 --> 08:01.211
I mean, don't you think?

08:02.889 --> 08:04.481
- Yes.
- Yeah.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.216
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

08:06.393 --> 08:08.623
Yeah, I really do.

08:10.030 --> 08:11.497
Hey!

08:11.665 --> 08:13.724
This was a gift.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.666
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

08:17.837 --> 08:19.464
It's still a gift.

08:19.739 --> 08:22.503
I got it from the gift shop.

08:23.977 --> 08:26.377
Okay! All right! Give me the mug!
I'll keep the mug!

08:26.546 --> 08:28.946
No! You know what,
don't do me any favors.

08:29.115 --> 08:30.605
In fact...

08:31.284 --> 08:34.048
...where's the rest of my stuff?
Like my...

08:36.389 --> 08:38.687
This book is mine!

08:40.794 --> 08:45.094
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

08:46.866 --> 08:51.428
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

08:51.604 --> 08:54.732
I'm just trying to help you move on.

08:55.175 --> 08:57.700
Oh, you are a petty man.

08:57.978 --> 09:00.071
You are a petty, petty...

09:00.347 --> 09:01.746
- Petty...
...petty, petty...

09:02.015 --> 09:03.380
...small...
...small...

09:07.354 --> 09:10.118
You are so just
doing this out of spite.

09:10.290 --> 09:14.852
No. No. No. I'm gonna wear
this all the time! I love this shirt!

09:15.428 --> 09:17.726
You have not worn
that T-shirt since you were 15!

09:17.897 --> 09:20.593
- It doesn't even fit you anymore!
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.601
Oh, okay. Okay!

09:35.815 --> 09:39.581
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

09:39.753 --> 09:42.313
...and relax...

09:42.789 --> 09:44.950
...in my favorite shirt.

09:46.826 --> 09:49.090
You have a pleasant evening.

09:58.738 --> 10:00.638
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

10:02.409 --> 10:04.741
And you're our age.
You're our age.

10:05.478 --> 10:10.541
You know what? You should buy a state
and then just name it after yourself.

10:10.950 --> 10:12.508
What, like, Pete Dakota?

10:14.154 --> 10:15.883
Yeah, or Mississi-Pete.

10:17.724 --> 10:20.818
Oh, I got it. Pete Chicago.

10:22.395 --> 10:24.260
That's not a state, Joe.

10:24.431 --> 10:26.194
Oh, and Mississi-Pete is?

10:29.202 --> 10:30.567
I gotta go. So...

10:31.237 --> 10:32.670
- I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

10:32.906 --> 10:35.340
You're our age.

10:36.843 --> 10:38.674
So are we on for tomorrow?

10:38.912 --> 10:40.777
Absolutely.

10:42.082 --> 10:44.880
Now, get out of here, you!

10:50.657 --> 10:53.990
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.

10:54.427 --> 10:56.054
Is something wrong with me?

10:56.229 --> 10:58.857
I mean, why am I only attracted
to guys with no future?

10:59.132 --> 11:01.726
Either they're too old,
or they're too young.

11:01.901 --> 11:05.064
Or they're a big misogynist
jerk poet like Julio.

11:05.238 --> 11:07.172
Who, by the way, I'm still attracted to.

11:08.274 --> 11:10.469
And then there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...

11:10.643 --> 11:13.578
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on!

11:13.746 --> 11:16.146
I mean, does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

11:16.316 --> 11:18.375
Yeah, kind of.

11:20.653 --> 11:23.554
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?

11:23.823 --> 11:25.120
Happy?

11:25.325 --> 11:27.953
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be?

11:28.194 --> 11:30.059
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

11:30.230 --> 11:33.063
I talk to you, and nothing!

11:33.233 --> 11:35.997
You look at me, and it's nothing!

11:38.972 --> 11:40.303
Nothing.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.036
Tasty.

11:45.645 --> 11:49.911
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.075
- I have a question about this scene.
- Yes.

11:53.253 --> 11:56.984
Well, I don't understand
why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.

11:57.157 --> 11:59.751
Peel the onion.

11:59.926 --> 12:02.053
First of all, he's good-looking.

12:03.730 --> 12:06.563
I think my character needs
a bit more of a reason than that.

12:06.833 --> 12:10.234
Hey, how about this one?
It says so in the script!

12:13.106 --> 12:16.166
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.

12:16.342 --> 12:19.368
I mean, it says in the script
here that you're a bitch.

12:19.946 --> 12:22.813
- It doesn't say that in the script.
- It does in mine.

12:26.119 --> 12:29.054
I can blow-dry it.
I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter.

12:29.222 --> 12:31.053
I still wind up with this little...

12:31.224 --> 12:35.593
...cowlick-y thing on the middle part
of my head. It's so annoying.

12:35.795 --> 12:38.127
- Does it bug you?
- You bug me.

12:51.311 --> 12:54.644
Is there any chance
you didn't see that?

12:59.385 --> 13:01.683
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

13:01.854 --> 13:04.721
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.920
You're gonna get peep-eye.

13:10.096 --> 13:13.088
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

13:13.266 --> 13:15.598
You know, she'd say no,
but here we are, right?

13:15.768 --> 13:18.066
We just broke up, first thing she does!

13:18.238 --> 13:21.901
- You didn't just break up.
- Hey, it's been, like, three weeks!

13:22.075 --> 13:26.136
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

13:26.379 --> 13:28.643
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

13:30.316 --> 13:32.011
Here they come! Here they...

13:32.352 --> 13:35.082
If she kisses him good night,
I'll kill myself. I swear.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.314
I can't, I can't watch.

13:38.091 --> 13:40.082
Come on.
Date over! Date over!

13:40.893 --> 13:43.623
- Here we go. She's going in.
- Okay.

13:43.796 --> 13:46.526
She's going in.
Wait! He's going in!

13:48.334 --> 13:49.767
He's going in!

13:49.936 --> 13:53.963
The door's closed! I can't see
anything with the door closed!

13:54.140 --> 13:58.008
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

13:58.177 --> 14:00.873
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it!

14:01.047 --> 14:02.241
- Stop what?
- I don't know.

14:02.415 --> 14:05.043
But I have a feeling that
my being there will do it.

14:06.919 --> 14:10.480
Look, this guy is bad news, Chandler.
I can sense he's an operator.

14:10.657 --> 14:12.181
Rachel wouldn't date an operator.

14:12.358 --> 14:15.452
They only make 20 grand a year
and they have to work nights.

14:17.997 --> 14:20.329
I'll go over and I will
borrow something!

14:20.733 --> 14:24.169
- Juice! I need juice!
- No! You can't!

14:24.771 --> 14:27.205
- They must be stopped!
- I am your friend...

14:27.373 --> 14:29.307
...and I am not gonna let you do this!

14:29.475 --> 14:32.205
You are surprisingly strong!

14:32.712 --> 14:36.239
- I need juice! People need juice!
- Look, man...

14:36.416 --> 14:37.906
- People need juice!
- Listen to me!

14:38.084 --> 14:40.279
Juice. They need...

14:43.156 --> 14:47.490
She's moving on, okay? If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

14:47.660 --> 14:50.527
And unless you're thinking
about subletting my peephole...

14:50.697 --> 14:53.962
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact the relationship is over!

14:54.200 --> 14:58.000
Okay, man? It's over.

15:00.406 --> 15:03.603
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

15:03.776 --> 15:06.677
It's just I miss her so much.

15:07.513 --> 15:09.413
I know.

15:12.885 --> 15:14.216
I know.

15:14.387 --> 15:20.087
Is it just me, or did "subletting my
peephole" sound kind of dirty?

15:22.462 --> 15:24.953
Why do your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

15:25.131 --> 15:27.599
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

15:27.834 --> 15:32.032
That way if one of them's missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

15:40.580 --> 15:44.539
- You know what?
- No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.

15:45.351 --> 15:49.082
- I can't do this.
- Yep. That's what I didn't want to know.

15:49.355 --> 15:52.950
Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

15:53.126 --> 15:55.617
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

15:55.795 --> 15:59.094
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.028
Fair, shmair. You know?

16:03.236 --> 16:06.569
Look, you wanna get back
at Ross, I am here for you.

16:07.507 --> 16:08.940
Really.

16:09.108 --> 16:14.171
No. No. I say, I say we get back at him
right here on this couch. Right here!

16:15.581 --> 16:18.345
Oh, God.

16:19.352 --> 16:20.910
I'm sorry about this.

16:22.288 --> 16:24.279
That's okay.

16:25.658 --> 16:28.388
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16:29.562 --> 16:32.998
I can just go home and get back
at him by myself.

16:36.436 --> 16:39.633
- And should become the penicillin
of the 21 st century.

16:39.806 --> 16:43.640
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...

16:43.810 --> 16:46.870
...toward leading that revolution.

16:47.046 --> 16:50.277
Hey, can I ask you something?

16:53.553 --> 16:54.577
Where are we?

16:55.555 --> 16:58.922
Well, with all these doctors
and nurses...

16:59.091 --> 17:01.082
...I'm gonna say midget rodeo.

17:02.028 --> 17:03.552
Just tell me the truth.

17:04.764 --> 17:06.698
Okay.

17:09.068 --> 17:11.764
You know, I don't think
I told you this...

17:11.971 --> 17:15.338
...but I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.907
Oh, right.
Wasn't that, like, a year ago?

17:19.879 --> 17:21.938
So I did tell you.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.306
Well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

17:24.550 --> 17:27.644
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life...

17:27.820 --> 17:29.583
...where I just need to focus on me.

17:30.089 --> 17:32.284
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, I know.

17:34.527 --> 17:38.896
- I so want to be attracted to you.
- But you're not. Okay. Good.

17:39.165 --> 17:41.133
I'm sorry.

17:42.835 --> 17:47.898
You know what? Don't be. It's...
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

17:48.508 --> 17:49.532
It's not?

17:49.709 --> 17:52.269
Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.478
Or someone you find attractive.

17:58.117 --> 18:00.176
I just think, you know...

18:00.453 --> 18:04.082
...that you might end up
feeling differently.

18:07.527 --> 18:10.360
Look, I don't want this
to come out wrong...

18:10.596 --> 18:14.657
...but you seem awfully confident for
a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.

18:14.834 --> 18:17.701
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?

18:18.604 --> 18:21.095
Listen, let's...
You wanna get something to eat?

18:21.274 --> 18:23.674
'Cause this place is kind of depressing.

18:24.744 --> 18:29.738
Now the man who made all this
possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

18:30.216 --> 18:32.150
One second.

18:38.991 --> 18:43.894
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

18:47.033 --> 18:48.625
Draw!

18:52.071 --> 18:53.800
I wasn't doing anything.

19:00.179 --> 19:02.773
Uh-oh. What did she do now?

19:02.949 --> 19:05.941
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like...

19:06.118 --> 19:10.817
...the greatest actress
since, since sliced bread.

19:11.624 --> 19:14.422
Sliced bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

19:15.094 --> 19:18.791
Oh, God. I just... I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...

19:19.031 --> 19:22.967
...and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good."

19:23.970 --> 19:26.336
I think somebody has
a crush on somebody.

19:26.505 --> 19:30.566
Hey, Chandler, can we please try and stay
focused on my problem here, you know?

19:31.110 --> 19:34.170
I'm talking about you,
you big, big freak.

19:39.251 --> 19:40.343
You're out of your mind!

19:40.519 --> 19:43.181
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for 48 hours.

19:43.389 --> 19:45.789
If you were in school,
you'd be pulling her pigtails...

19:45.958 --> 19:48.188
...and pushing her down now.

19:48.361 --> 19:49.350
Oh, yeah?

19:49.528 --> 19:53.862
Then how come I keep thinking about her
in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?

20:00.239 --> 20:04.232
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

20:04.543 --> 20:07.376
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be?

20:07.546 --> 20:09.537
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

20:10.149 --> 20:12.310
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

20:12.852 --> 20:15.787
You look at me, and nothing.

20:28.601 --> 20:29.829
Nothing.

20:31.937 --> 20:36.237
You guys make me fly!

20:38.110 --> 20:39.475
High!

20:40.513 --> 20:43.448
Okay, we're gonna
pick it up here, tomorrow.

20:45.685 --> 20:48.119
- Well, that was...
- Better?

20:48.387 --> 20:51.515
Yeah. Yeah, it was definitely...

20:51.691 --> 20:53.886
...an improvement.

20:54.794 --> 20:56.762
- Good night.
- Kate.

20:58.764 --> 21:00.197
You forgot your shoes.

21:02.702 --> 21:05.296
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

21:10.209 --> 21:12.268
Hey, listen, do you...

21:12.745 --> 21:14.406
...feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

21:16.382 --> 21:17.406
- Kate.
- Yeah.

21:17.616 --> 21:20.141
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

21:21.287 --> 21:24.518
Very nice. Very nice.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.484
So...

21:28.928 --> 21:30.896
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah. Sure.

21:31.063 --> 21:33.190
- Right.
- Good night.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.033
Hey.

21:45.745 --> 21:47.940
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

21:48.247 --> 21:50.112
You know? Like Goldman, Silverman?

21:50.983 --> 21:53.315
Because it's not his last name.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.680
It isn't?

21:54.854 --> 21:56.583
No. It's not, like...

21:56.822 --> 21:58.517
...like, Phil Spiderman.

22:01.527 --> 22:02.687
He's a spider...

22:02.928 --> 22:04.987
...man.

22:05.631 --> 22:08.657
You know, like,
Goldman is a last name.

22:08.934 --> 22:11.425
But there's no Gold Man.

22:12.571 --> 22:13.868
Okay.

22:14.039 --> 22:15.700
There should be a Gold Man!

22:18.277 --> 22:19.938
- Hey.
- Hey, Rach.

22:20.112 --> 22:21.739
- How was work?
- Oh, it was great.

22:21.914 --> 22:25.077
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

22:25.718 --> 22:28.186
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

22:28.354 --> 22:31.915
Oh. Well, I guess I had
that one coming.

22:32.091 --> 22:35.959
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just shampoo and...

22:37.196 --> 22:38.663
Something wrong?

22:48.073 --> 22:50.473
No. Nothing.

22:55.948 --> 22:59.645
So, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

23:00.719 --> 23:04.052
Okay. Well, he would
turn things to gold.

23:04.223 --> 23:06.418
What about things that are already gold?

23:06.592 --> 23:08.492
His work is done.

23:10.029 --> 23:13.260
Okay, I have a friend, Jimmy Tupperman,
what would his powers be?

23:13.432 --> 23:15.900
Tupper Man.

23:16.669 --> 23:19.661
He would keep criminals fresh
until the police came.

23:22.241 --> 23:24.732
- Okay. Let's play my game now.
- Okay.

23:24.910 --> 23:28.778
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered... Draw!

23:32.451 --> 23:33.440
