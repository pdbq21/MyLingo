WEBVTT

00:03.618 --> 00:05.916
- I don't know.
- What?

00:06.087 --> 00:08.647
Well, as old as he is
in dog years...

00:08.823 --> 00:12.350
...do you think Snoopy should
still be allowed to fly this thing?

00:12.527 --> 00:14.722
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

00:14.896 --> 00:18.798
You remember when you first came here,
how you spent two weeks getting trained?

00:18.967 --> 00:21.731
Sure. Do you need me
to train somebody new?

00:23.037 --> 00:24.231
Good one.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.571
Actually, Terry wants you to take
the training again. Whenever.

00:34.215 --> 00:35.944
Do you believe that?

00:41.556 --> 00:42.580
Yeah.

00:45.894 --> 00:47.020
The One Where Rachel Quits

01:31.773 --> 01:35.004
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

01:35.810 --> 01:39.906
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.

01:42.016 --> 01:44.610
Just admit it, Chandler.
You have no backhand.

01:44.786 --> 01:47.653
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.

01:47.956 --> 01:51.153
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...

01:51.426 --> 01:53.155
...is not a backhand.

01:54.696 --> 01:56.323
I was shrieking...

01:56.631 --> 01:57.825
...like a Marine.

02:00.068 --> 02:04.402
All right, here. Watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

02:04.572 --> 02:05.766
Power.

02:06.674 --> 02:07.698
Precision.

02:08.109 --> 02:09.303
And panache.

02:13.982 --> 02:15.916
You broke a little girl's leg?

02:16.417 --> 02:18.817
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

02:18.987 --> 02:23.014
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

02:24.058 --> 02:27.221
Where exactly were you around 10-ish?

02:27.862 --> 02:31.491
Well, I'm gonna go see her.
I wanna bring her something.

02:31.666 --> 02:34.328
- What do you think she'd like?
- Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

02:34.569 --> 02:36.764
The ability to walk?

02:40.375 --> 02:42.400
I'm gonna get back to re-training.

02:42.610 --> 02:44.737
All right. See you guys.

02:44.912 --> 02:46.777
Look out, kids! He's coming!

02:49.984 --> 02:51.918
And I gotta go sell
some Christmas trees.

02:52.220 --> 02:54.745
Have fun.
Wait! No, don't!

02:54.956 --> 02:58.187
I forgot. I am totally
against that now.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.890
What? Me having a job?

03:02.063 --> 03:06.432
No. No, I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...

03:06.701 --> 03:09.534
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...

03:09.737 --> 03:12.365
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.009
Hey, how do you sleep at night?

03:15.176 --> 03:18.873
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

03:20.148 --> 03:23.584
Hey, Phoebe, listen.
You got this all wrong.

03:23.751 --> 03:25.878
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.

03:26.054 --> 03:30.115
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

03:30.358 --> 03:31.484
Really?

03:33.594 --> 03:35.562
Yes.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.991
Yes, and the trees are happy too...

03:38.266 --> 03:40.427
...because, for most of them,
it's their only...

03:40.735 --> 03:42.396
...chance to see New York.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.572
After you've delivered the drinks,
take the tray...

03:48.810 --> 03:52.337
Gunther, please. I have worked here
for two and a half years.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.242
I know the empty trays go over there.

03:55.483 --> 03:58.577
What if you put them here?

04:00.488 --> 04:04.015
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

04:04.192 --> 04:07.821
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.

04:07.995 --> 04:10.259
They already do.

04:10.498 --> 04:12.966
That's why they call it the tray spot.

04:13.134 --> 04:15.227
Jeez, I always heard them
talk about that.

04:15.403 --> 04:19.396
I sort of just thought it was, like,
a club they went to. Oh, God.

04:20.508 --> 04:22.942
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

04:24.679 --> 04:26.806
Sweetheart.

04:29.050 --> 04:32.679
So this must be
kind of neat for you, huh?

04:32.954 --> 04:35.548
Your dad tells me you get
a couple of days off school...

04:35.723 --> 04:38.920
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

04:40.461 --> 04:42.759
Well, I kind of wanted
to sell the cookies.

04:42.930 --> 04:45.490
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...

04:45.700 --> 04:47.964
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

04:48.136 --> 04:52.573
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?

04:52.874 --> 04:56.537
Yeah. My dad says if I spend as much
time helping him clean apartments...

04:56.711 --> 04:59.145
...as I do daydreaming
about outer space...

04:59.313 --> 05:02.111
...he'd be able to afford
a trip to the Taj Mahal.

05:02.283 --> 05:06.515
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.

05:06.687 --> 05:09.850
No. The one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

05:11.959 --> 05:15.417
He says he's gonna double the
college money my grandma left me.

05:18.032 --> 05:20.398
Well, good luck to Dad.

05:22.503 --> 05:27.031
Say, how many more boxes would
you have to sell in order to win?

05:27.208 --> 05:31.577
- The girl who won last year sold 475.
- Yeah?

05:31.746 --> 05:34.647
So far, I've sold 75.

05:37.285 --> 05:39.651
Four hundred, huh?

05:39.887 --> 05:43.345
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

05:43.524 --> 05:44.684
Five dollars a box.

05:45.293 --> 05:47.625
And what is second prize?

05:48.429 --> 05:52.490
A 10-speed bike. But I'd rather have
something my dad couldn't sell.

05:55.169 --> 05:56.693
Well, that makes sense.

05:56.871 --> 05:58.395
Could you do me one favor?

05:58.573 --> 06:01.337
- If it's not too much trouble.
- Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

06:01.509 --> 06:03.477
Could you pull the curtains open for me?

06:03.644 --> 06:06.442
The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news.

06:06.614 --> 06:09.082
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

06:09.250 --> 06:12.742
...said she'd push hers up
to her window so I can watch it.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.427
Yes?

06:26.601 --> 06:29.195
Yeah, hi. I'm selling
Brown Bird cookies.

06:29.370 --> 06:33.966
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.

06:35.243 --> 06:39.646
No. Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

06:42.517 --> 06:43.745
What does that mean?

06:43.985 --> 06:49.890
Well, it means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

06:53.127 --> 06:55.823
I can dial 911 at the press
of a button, you know.

06:55.997 --> 06:57.259
Now, go away!

06:57.498 --> 07:00.296
Please, please.
It's for a poor little girl...

07:00.535 --> 07:03.971
...who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

07:04.272 --> 07:05.603
I'm pressing.

07:05.806 --> 07:07.933
A policeman is on his way.

07:08.109 --> 07:10.669
Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.373
I can still see you!

07:17.552 --> 07:18.610
All right!

07:22.189 --> 07:24.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:25.026 --> 07:26.152
What are you doing here?

07:26.327 --> 07:28.887
Well, I thought
a lot about what you said...

07:29.063 --> 07:32.624
...and I realize maybe
I was a little judgmental.

07:32.867 --> 07:35.062
Yeah. But...

07:35.236 --> 07:37.670
Now, Phoebe, remember, hey...

07:37.838 --> 07:40.136
...they're just fulfilling
their Christmas...

07:40.308 --> 07:41.775
- Destiny. Yes.
- Sure.

07:42.977 --> 07:44.808
Okay.

07:45.146 --> 07:48.138
Yikes. That one
doesn't look very fulfilled.

07:48.316 --> 07:51.479
That's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

07:51.686 --> 07:54.120
You keep the old ones in the back?

07:54.288 --> 07:56.620
That is so ageist.

07:57.658 --> 08:02.027
- We have to make room for the fresh ones.
- So, what happens to the old guys?

08:02.530 --> 08:04.020
Well, they go into the chipper.

08:05.466 --> 08:08.492
Why do I have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?

08:25.753 --> 08:28.313
These come in the shapes of your
favorite Christmas characters.

08:28.489 --> 08:31.151
Santa, Rudolph and baby Jesus.

08:32.927 --> 08:35.725
All right. I'll take a box
of the cream-filled Jesuses.

08:36.998 --> 08:40.695
Wait a minute. One box? Come on. I'm
trying to send a little girl to Space Camp.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.803
I'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?

08:43.971 --> 08:48.271
All right. Do you have any
coconut-flavored deities?

08:48.442 --> 08:52.811
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

08:53.581 --> 08:57.244
I'll tell you what. I'll put you down
for eight boxes. One for each night.

08:57.418 --> 08:58.407
Mon?

08:58.586 --> 09:02.784
All right. I'll take one box of
the Mint Treasures. One, and that's it.

09:03.057 --> 09:06.151
I started gaining weight after
I joined the Brown Birds. Remember?

09:06.327 --> 09:09.763
Dad bought every one
of my boxes, and I ate them all.

09:10.731 --> 09:13.632
No, Mon. Dad had to buy
every one of your boxes...

09:13.801 --> 09:15.860
...because you ate them all.

09:18.205 --> 09:22.938
But, you know, I'm sure that's
not gonna happen this time.

09:23.110 --> 09:25.806
Why don't I put you down
for three of the Mint Treasures...

09:25.980 --> 09:27.777
...and just a couple of the Rudolphs.

09:27.948 --> 09:29.506
No.

09:31.485 --> 09:34.613
Come on, now.
You know you want them.

09:34.789 --> 09:37.121
Don't. Don't do this.

09:37.291 --> 09:41.921
I'll tell you what, Mon.
I'll give you the first box for free.

09:43.130 --> 09:44.825
Oh, God! I gotta go!

09:44.999 --> 09:48.298
Come on. All the cool kids
are eating them.

09:50.171 --> 09:53.607
When you have a second, I want to show
you why we don't just trap spiders...

09:53.774 --> 09:56.504
...under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

09:59.747 --> 10:04.184
I'm training to be better at a job
that I hate. My life officially sucks.

10:04.351 --> 10:06.319
Wasn't this supposed
to be a temporary thing?

10:06.487 --> 10:10.753
- I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.
- Well, yeah. I'm still pursuing that.

10:11.292 --> 10:13.760
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

10:13.928 --> 10:18.024
You know, other than sending out
resumes, like, what? Two years ago?

10:18.766 --> 10:21.701
Well, I'm also sending out...

10:21.869 --> 10:24.201
...good thoughts.

10:25.306 --> 10:28.104
If you ask me,
as long as you got this job...

10:28.275 --> 10:30.835
...you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

10:31.011 --> 10:33.377
You need The Fear.

10:33.547 --> 10:35.242
- The Fear?
- He's right.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.883
If you quit this job, you then...

10:37.051 --> 10:40.145
...have motivation to go after
a job you really want.

10:40.321 --> 10:41.982
Why are you still at a job you hate?

10:42.156 --> 10:44.989
I mean, why don't you quit
and get The Fear?

10:46.160 --> 10:48.594
Because I'm too afraid.

10:50.464 --> 10:51.453
I don't know.

10:51.632 --> 10:56.092
I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

10:56.270 --> 10:58.830
I just don't want to be 30
and still work here.

10:59.006 --> 11:03.909
Yeah, that'd be much worse than
being 28 and still working here.

11:04.078 --> 11:05.978
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

11:06.147 --> 11:10.447
Remind me to review with you which
pot is decaf and which is regular.

11:11.786 --> 11:14.277
Can't I just look at the handles on them?

11:14.455 --> 11:16.218
You would think.

11:16.857 --> 11:20.850
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.

11:21.095 --> 11:25.054
Do you know why I'm a terrible
waitress? Because I don't care.

11:25.666 --> 11:28.829
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

11:29.003 --> 11:31.597
I don't care where the tray spot is.
I just don't care.

11:31.772 --> 11:34.263
This is not what I want to do.

11:35.442 --> 11:38.502
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

11:39.647 --> 11:42.115
- I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
- What?

11:42.283 --> 11:44.251
Gunther, I quit.

11:46.220 --> 11:49.246
Does this mean we're gonna
have to start paying for coffee?

11:55.162 --> 11:56.561
Okay, 12.

11:57.398 --> 11:58.729
Twenty-two.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.561
Eighteen.

12:05.339 --> 12:06.328
What?

12:06.507 --> 12:08.338
I spelled out "boobies."

12:12.913 --> 12:16.815
Ross? Put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

12:16.984 --> 12:19.509
Where are the Mint Treasures?

12:20.254 --> 12:22.245
We're out. I sold them all.

12:22.756 --> 12:24.280
What?

12:24.458 --> 12:26.858
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

12:28.929 --> 12:30.294
No.

12:30.464 --> 12:32.193
No.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.428
Just a couple more boxes.

12:36.303 --> 12:38.828
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

12:40.608 --> 12:43.372
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes!

12:44.511 --> 12:46.945
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

12:47.448 --> 12:48.437
Oh, God!

12:51.552 --> 12:54.544
- So how many you sold so far?
- Check this out.

12:54.722 --> 12:59.022
- Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
- Oh, my God. How did you do that?

12:59.193 --> 13:01.491
Okay, the other night
I was leaving the museum...

13:01.662 --> 13:05.860
...just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.997
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.

13:09.236 --> 13:12.831
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.

13:14.541 --> 13:19.342
So I started hitting
the NYU dorms around midnight.

13:21.048 --> 13:24.415
I am selling cookies by the case.

13:24.585 --> 13:28.214
They call me "Cookie Dude."

13:30.724 --> 13:34.285
- Okay, but I'm not going to call you that.
- Okay.

13:35.062 --> 13:38.998
Okay. Stop what you're doing. I need
envelope stuffers. I need stamp lickers...

13:39.166 --> 13:42.932
- Hey, who did these resumes for you?
- Me. On my computer.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.035
You sure used a large font.

13:45.272 --> 13:47.740
Yeah. Well, "Waitress
at a Coffeehouse"...

13:47.908 --> 13:51.605
...and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"
only took up so much room.

13:53.347 --> 13:54.712
Hey, that's funny!

13:54.882 --> 13:57.578
You're funny, Chandler!
You're a funny guy!

13:57.785 --> 13:59.582
You know what else is really funny?

14:00.254 --> 14:02.779
Something else I might have said?

14:03.557 --> 14:07.323
I don't know. I don't know. Weren't you
the guy that told me to quit my job...

14:07.494 --> 14:10.759
...when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?

14:13.767 --> 14:17.362
- Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.

14:17.538 --> 14:21.474
Tomorrow is my last day,
and I don't have a lead.

14:21.642 --> 14:24.133
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther...

14:24.311 --> 14:26.040
...and tell him I'm not quitting.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.704
You don't want to give in to The Fear.

14:28.882 --> 14:32.340
You and your stupid Fear.
I hate your Fear!

14:32.519 --> 14:34.919
I would like to take
you and your Fear...

14:35.089 --> 14:37.455
Hey! I got great news.

14:37.624 --> 14:40.422
Run, Joey. Run for your life!

14:42.096 --> 14:45.623
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever
heard of Fortunata Fashions?

14:45.799 --> 14:46.788
No.

14:46.967 --> 14:50.459
My old man's doing a plumbing job there,
and he heard they have an opening.

14:50.637 --> 14:52.628
Want to see if he
can get you an interview?

14:52.806 --> 14:56.708
Oh, my God, yes. I would love that.
That's so sweet, Joey.

14:56.877 --> 14:58.037
Not a problem.

14:58.212 --> 15:00.737
And now for the great news.

15:01.015 --> 15:02.676
What, that wasn't the great news?

15:02.850 --> 15:04.681
Only if you think
it's better than this.

15:05.319 --> 15:07.344
Snow-in-a-Can!

15:08.522 --> 15:10.922
I got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?

15:11.125 --> 15:12.956
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

15:13.360 --> 15:15.191
Christmas cookie?

15:20.367 --> 15:22.835
Okay, and this one here's
a Douglas fir.

15:23.003 --> 15:26.632
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

15:27.474 --> 15:29.169
Looks good. I'll take it.

15:29.343 --> 15:31.777
Wait, wait. No, no.
You don't want that one.

15:32.012 --> 15:35.345
No. You can have
this cool brown one.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.949
It's almost dead.

15:39.119 --> 15:42.850
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.

15:43.023 --> 15:47.323
Otherwise, they're gonna throw
it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.

15:47.494 --> 15:51.225
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny...

15:51.398 --> 15:53.798
...are thrown in the chipper.

15:54.601 --> 15:57.900
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

15:58.672 --> 16:02.699
Pheebs. You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.575
Hey, guys. I'm here
to pick out my Christmas tree.

16:06.814 --> 16:10.682
Well, look no further.
This one's yours.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.946
Is this the one
that I threw out last year?

16:16.990 --> 16:21.086
All right. You know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.

16:21.261 --> 16:25.630
Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get so emotional. I guess it's just...

16:25.799 --> 16:27.357
The holidays are just hard.

16:27.534 --> 16:31.265
Oh, honey. Is that because
your mom died around Christmas?

16:31.438 --> 16:33.804
I wasn't even thinking about that.

16:43.317 --> 16:46.309
Hi, there.
How many did you sell?

16:46.520 --> 16:51.355
I'm not gonna tell you. You're the
bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

16:52.493 --> 16:55.018
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

16:55.195 --> 16:56.457
You're a big scrud.

16:58.599 --> 17:00.089
What's a scrud?

17:00.267 --> 17:02.394
Why don't you look
in the mirror, scrud.

17:04.404 --> 17:07.999
I don't have to.
I can just look at you.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.570
All right, girls...

17:11.778 --> 17:13.143
...and man.

17:14.548 --> 17:16.778
Let's see your final tallies.

17:17.784 --> 17:19.581
Debbie.

17:20.087 --> 17:23.614
Three hundred and twenty-one
boxes of cookies. Very nice.

17:24.124 --> 17:26.558
Not nice enough.

17:26.860 --> 17:28.157
Charla.

17:28.328 --> 17:30.296
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

17:30.564 --> 17:32.464
Sorry, dear, but still good.

17:32.633 --> 17:35.500
Good for a scrud.

17:38.272 --> 17:39.705
Yes, Elizabeth.

17:40.707 --> 17:43.039
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.201
That's crap!

17:48.415 --> 17:50.906
Sister Brown Bird.

17:51.151 --> 17:53.142
Good going.

17:55.355 --> 17:57.653
Who's next?

18:01.695 --> 18:04.289
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

18:04.898 --> 18:06.991
And batting for Sarah...

18:07.834 --> 18:09.358
...Ross Geller.

18:10.337 --> 18:13.738
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

18:14.641 --> 18:18.941
Although, it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

18:19.112 --> 18:22.206
That is because my doctor
says that I have...

18:22.382 --> 18:25.783
...a very serious...

18:25.953 --> 18:28.251
...nougat...

18:29.523 --> 18:31.957
...deficiency.

18:33.026 --> 18:34.891
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

18:37.197 --> 18:41.395
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned
her uniform to her 19-year-old sister...

18:41.568 --> 18:46.562
...who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.

18:48.475 --> 18:51.638
- Hey, how'd the interview go?
- I blew it.

18:51.812 --> 18:54.280
I wouldn't have even hired me.

18:54.815 --> 18:55.873
Come here, sweetie.

18:56.116 --> 18:57.242
Listen...

18:57.584 --> 19:02.817
...you're gonna go on, like, a thousand
interviews before you get a job.

19:06.627 --> 19:09.687
That's not how that
was supposed to come out.

19:09.863 --> 19:11.956
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

19:12.432 --> 19:15.629
You know what, Rach? Maybe you
should stay here at the coffeehouse.

19:15.802 --> 19:19.829
I can't. It's too late. Terry already
hired that girl over there.

19:20.107 --> 19:21.267
Look at her.

19:21.441 --> 19:24.410
She's even got waitress experience.

19:24.945 --> 19:26.572
Last night she was...

19:26.980 --> 19:28.914
...teaching everybody
how to make...

19:29.149 --> 19:30.446
...napkins...

19:30.684 --> 19:33.653
...into...

19:35.455 --> 19:38.083
That word was "swans."

19:42.062 --> 19:47.022
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet
himself really perked up my Christmas.

19:54.941 --> 19:56.568
Oh, my God!

19:57.144 --> 19:58.634
Merry Christmas!

20:00.113 --> 20:02.343
You saved them!
You guys!

20:02.616 --> 20:04.607
Oh, God, you're the best!

20:04.785 --> 20:07.447
It's like Night of the
Living Dead Christmas Trees.

20:10.924 --> 20:12.619
Hello.

20:12.793 --> 20:14.852
Yeah, this is she.

20:16.697 --> 20:18.892
You're kidding. You're kidding.

20:19.466 --> 20:21.457
Thank you. I love you!

20:21.635 --> 20:23.933
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

20:24.104 --> 20:25.765
I got the job!

20:25.939 --> 20:28.203
That's great.

20:28.608 --> 20:31.941
God bless us, everyone.

20:34.047 --> 20:38.143
Here we go. Serving
my last cup of coffee.

20:45.559 --> 20:46.651
There you go.

20:46.893 --> 20:48.554
Enjoy.

20:51.465 --> 20:54.332
- Should I tell her I ordered tea?
- No.

20:55.435 --> 20:56.766
Excuse me, everyone.

20:58.004 --> 21:00.268
This is my last night working here...

21:00.440 --> 21:02.704
...and I just wanted to say...

21:02.876 --> 21:05.743
...that I made some
really good friends here.

21:06.046 --> 21:08.742
And it's just time to move on.

21:12.986 --> 21:15.682
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...

21:15.856 --> 21:19.292
...but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...

21:19.459 --> 21:22.019
...that as of this moment...

21:22.195 --> 21:27.064
...I will never have
to make coffee again.

21:27.234 --> 21:30.032
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Likes his coffee strong.

21:30.203 --> 21:33.639
So you're gonna use
two bags instead of one.

21:33.807 --> 21:36.605
See. Now, pay attention,
because this part's tricky.

21:36.777 --> 21:41.544
See, some people use filters
just once...

21:49.489 --> 21:51.650
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...

21:51.825 --> 21:57.320
...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow
this may help make up for it. Okay?

21:57.497 --> 21:59.362
Presenting...

21:59.533 --> 22:03.264
...Sarah Tuddle's
Private Very Special Space Camp!

22:07.607 --> 22:09.734
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.

22:09.910 --> 22:11.844
Come on, here we go.

22:12.546 --> 22:16.380
Stand by for mission countdown.

22:16.817 --> 22:17.943
Ten, ten...

22:18.118 --> 22:19.380
Nine, nine, nine...

22:19.586 --> 22:21.110
Eight, eight, eight...

22:22.556 --> 22:24.456
Okay, blast off.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.791
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

22:36.036 --> 22:37.025
Oh, no! An asteroid!

22:40.707 --> 22:41.696
