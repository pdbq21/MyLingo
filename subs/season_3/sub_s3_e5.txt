WEBVTT

00:08.185 --> 00:12.121
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

00:12.789 --> 00:17.317
No. You know how we're always
saying we need a place for the mail.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.826
Yeah?

00:22.399 --> 00:27.530
I started building one. But then
I decided to take it to the next step.

00:28.705 --> 00:31.037
You're building a post office?

00:31.942 --> 00:35.173
No, an entertainment unit
with a built-in mail cubby.

00:35.445 --> 00:39.211
- It's a one-day job, max.
- Okay.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.514
My word, those are snug!

00:43.854 --> 00:46.516
Yeah. These are
my old work pants.

00:46.823 --> 00:48.916
Sergio Valente.

00:58.468 --> 01:01.130
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

01:02.706 --> 01:04.901
The One With Frank Jr.

01:51.555 --> 01:54.183
Hey, Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?

01:54.358 --> 01:56.383
No, but he's always late.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.926
- I thought you only met him once.
- I did.

02:00.598 --> 02:04.034
I think it sounds big sister-y,
"Frank's always late."

02:05.069 --> 02:07.264
Well, relax. He'll be here.

02:07.438 --> 02:09.372
I know.
I'm just nervous.

02:09.540 --> 02:12.737
It's just, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

02:12.977 --> 02:15.605
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

02:16.213 --> 02:20.274
It's just the last-desperate-
chance-to-have-a-family kind of thing.

02:20.451 --> 02:22.078
You're sweet to wait with me.

02:22.253 --> 02:26.246
Actually, Gunther sent me. You're not
allowed to have cups out here.

02:29.326 --> 02:31.794
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

02:33.897 --> 02:37.128
No. But he told me he thinks
you're a fox.

02:38.936 --> 02:40.631
All right. Janice likes him.

02:40.804 --> 02:44.763
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her freebie list.

02:46.176 --> 02:47.268
Her what?

02:47.444 --> 02:52.643
We have a deal where we each get to pick
five celebrities we could sleep with...

02:53.417 --> 02:55.544
...and the other one can't get mad.

02:55.753 --> 02:58.916
The heart of every
healthy relationship:

02:59.089 --> 03:02.547
Honesty, respect
and sex with celebrities.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.752
So who's on your list?

03:04.928 --> 03:06.452
Kim Basinger...

03:06.630 --> 03:08.928
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

03:09.233 --> 03:10.996
...Yasmine Bleeth...

03:12.002 --> 03:14.197
...and Jessica Rabbit.

03:15.839 --> 03:20.139
You do realize that she is a cartoon
and way out of your league?

03:20.344 --> 03:24.371
I know. I always wondered if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

03:25.983 --> 03:27.382
This is such a great thing.

03:27.551 --> 03:31.920
Annie Esposito would never have
dumped me had we had a list like this.

03:32.089 --> 03:36.185
And also, of course,
if her sister was famous.

03:37.428 --> 03:38.827
Who would yours be?

03:39.163 --> 03:42.030
First, I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.767
It's just a game, Mon.

03:46.837 --> 03:48.270
Rach, how about you?

03:48.439 --> 03:52.569
I don't know. I guess Chris
O'Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr...

03:52.843 --> 03:56.506
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

03:58.282 --> 04:00.011
Spider-Man?

04:00.184 --> 04:01.981
Hardy Boy.

04:02.419 --> 04:05.388
- Peter Parker.
- Thank you.

04:05.923 --> 04:08.448
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

04:08.726 --> 04:12.162
That kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

04:12.329 --> 04:16.356
First, I'd divide my prospective
candidates into categories.

04:16.533 --> 04:17.557
What a geek!

04:19.470 --> 04:22.405
Everybody, this is Frank!
My half brother, Frank!

04:22.639 --> 04:24.038
This is everybody.

04:24.241 --> 04:26.038
- This is Ross.
- How are you?

04:26.210 --> 04:27.905
- Chandler.
- Hi.

04:28.078 --> 04:30.546
- Joey.
- Hey.

04:30.914 --> 04:32.176
This is Monica.

04:34.952 --> 04:36.613
And this is Rachel.

04:40.391 --> 04:41.881
I'm gonna get coffee for us.

04:42.159 --> 04:44.855
Hey, how do you guys get
anything done?

04:45.329 --> 04:47.229
We don't, really.

04:48.632 --> 04:50.463
So now,
do you guys have big plans?

04:50.634 --> 04:54.536
Yeah. We're gonna connect
and bond and everything.

04:54.738 --> 04:59.368
I thought we could go down to Times
Square and pick up some ninja stars.

04:59.543 --> 05:03.673
My friend Larry, he wants me
to take a picture of a hooker.

05:05.315 --> 05:08.284
We really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

05:22.766 --> 05:24.961
Sorry. Did I get you?

05:26.036 --> 05:27.435
No, you didn't get me!

05:27.671 --> 05:31.038
It's an electric drill!
You get me, you kill me!

05:32.142 --> 05:34.406
Calm down!
Do you want this unit or not?

05:34.711 --> 05:37.043
I do not want this unit!

05:37.247 --> 05:40.341
You should've told me before.
I'm not a mind reader.

05:42.119 --> 05:45.145
And we're out of beer.
I'm going to Monica's.

05:45.756 --> 05:46.950
Fine!

05:54.364 --> 05:57.094
Where you heading in those pants?
1982?

05:58.735 --> 05:59.827
Monica, listen...

06:00.003 --> 06:03.939
...I saw down at the hardware store,
they got those designer tiles on sale...

06:04.107 --> 06:06.268
...if you wanna redo
your bathroom floor.

06:06.443 --> 06:08.411
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

06:08.579 --> 06:11.446
Nothing. It's just old and dingy,
that's all.

06:12.349 --> 06:15.648
- I highly doubt that.
- Oh, yeah?

06:15.819 --> 06:18.549
If you move your hamper...

06:18.722 --> 06:22.453
...you can see the color
the tile used to be.

06:24.194 --> 06:27.095
I can't live like this!
What are we gonna do?

06:27.264 --> 06:28.663
Relax. Here, hold this.

06:28.832 --> 06:31.596
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

06:34.304 --> 06:36.829
A little more than I wanted to see.

06:39.543 --> 06:42.569
Look at that!
Every inch of this is glued down.

06:42.746 --> 06:45.374
It'd take forever to pry this up.

06:45.549 --> 06:47.676
You should just leave it.

06:48.218 --> 06:52.814
I can't leave it! You gouged
a hole in my dingy floor!

07:01.365 --> 07:03.765
There. There you go.

07:04.234 --> 07:05.565
Yeah, that's nice.

07:05.736 --> 07:09.502
We can put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon.

07:10.874 --> 07:12.000
Give me a new floor!

07:12.175 --> 07:15.941
I can't. Chandler will kill me
if I don't finish the unit.

07:16.113 --> 07:19.981
- I'll pay you double what he's paying you.
- He's not paying me anything.

07:20.150 --> 07:21.674
Triple.

07:33.297 --> 07:34.286
What?

07:34.464 --> 07:37.433
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

07:39.303 --> 07:41.362
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

07:41.538 --> 07:45.065
And I figured that was
something I got from our dad.

07:45.242 --> 07:47.608
Well, wait, you mean like this?

07:48.779 --> 07:50.974
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

07:52.249 --> 07:53.511
You're not doing it.

07:53.850 --> 07:57.308
Oh, right. Okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

07:58.655 --> 08:00.680
We don't have that.

08:06.263 --> 08:09.096
- When's your birthday?
- February 16.

08:09.499 --> 08:11.729
I know a guy who's the 18th.

08:13.704 --> 08:15.535
That's close.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.173
- When's yours?
- October 25.

08:24.381 --> 08:26.872
That's the same month as Halloween.

08:31.188 --> 08:34.282
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

08:35.225 --> 08:36.590
Melt stuff.

08:41.031 --> 08:44.660
- Okay, I've got three of my five.
- Three of your five what?

08:45.235 --> 08:47.931
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

08:48.271 --> 08:50.501
God, you're giving this
a lot of thought.

08:50.674 --> 08:53.370
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

08:53.543 --> 08:56.706
All right. Who you got it
narrowed down to?

08:56.913 --> 09:00.178
- Elizabeth Hurley.
- Very attractive.

09:00.350 --> 09:01.942
Forgiving.

09:04.187 --> 09:05.848
Susan Sarandon.

09:07.524 --> 09:09.719
You know what?
She's too political.

09:09.893 --> 09:14.557
She probably wouldn't let you do it unless
you donated four cans of food first.

09:15.899 --> 09:20.063
- And Isabella Rossellini.
- Very hot. Very sexy.

09:20.237 --> 09:23.536
But she's too international.

09:23.707 --> 09:25.470
She's never gonna be around.

09:25.642 --> 09:28.008
- So?
- So you gotta play the odds.

09:28.178 --> 09:31.341
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country all the time.

09:31.915 --> 09:36.511
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

09:46.496 --> 09:49.863
Okay. So by "melting"
you meant melting.

09:51.968 --> 09:55.199
- So is it, like, art?
- Yeah, you can melt art.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.706
Hey, can I use your phone?

10:00.143 --> 10:04.239
- Sure. You want to call your mom?
- No, I want to melt it.

10:06.249 --> 10:09.116
Just the numbers.
It will still work.

10:09.619 --> 10:12.315
Well, not right now.

10:18.295 --> 10:22.391
I'm gonna go to bed. The fumes
are giving me a headache. So...

10:27.137 --> 10:29.469
Good night, bro.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.234
Good night.

10:35.679 --> 10:36.805
Here.

10:37.514 --> 10:38.845
Just in case.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.676
Oh, excellent!

10:54.965 --> 10:58.423
- What kind of karate is that?
- No kind.

10:59.836 --> 11:01.861
He just makes it up.

11:02.272 --> 11:06.038
- How's it going with you guys?
- So far it kind of blows.

11:10.113 --> 11:13.571
I don't know, I just thought
he'd feel more like a brother.

11:13.850 --> 11:16.216
Like you and Ross.
Close and connected and...

11:16.386 --> 11:19.116
Honey, we're close now.
You wouldn't believe the years...

11:19.289 --> 11:25.353
...of noogies and wedgies and flying
wedgies and atomic wedgies and...

11:25.529 --> 11:28.225
That's when the waistband
goes over your head.

11:31.234 --> 11:33.532
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

11:33.703 --> 11:36.672
- How do you play the shadow game?
- How do you play the shadow game?

11:36.840 --> 11:39.035
- I just asked you.
- I just asked you.

11:39.209 --> 11:41.302
I don't have time for this.

11:41.478 --> 11:42.809
That is what the game is.

11:42.979 --> 11:46.210
You just gave up really quickly.

11:47.851 --> 11:49.512
- You seen Joey?
- What's the matter?

11:49.753 --> 11:52.313
Just this!

11:56.993 --> 12:01.726
It's my fault, really, because the
couch is where we keep the varnish.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.932
Somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

12:08.405 --> 12:11.101
- What's going on?
- He's retiling my floor.

12:12.309 --> 12:14.174
Spackle boy!

12:15.045 --> 12:16.273
Get up!

12:16.446 --> 12:20.041
- You started this, you will finish it!
- He started mine first!

12:20.217 --> 12:23.152
Build the unit, Cinderellie
Lay the tile, Cinderellie

12:28.658 --> 12:32.116
- He was helping me first.
- No, I need a bathroom. I'm a girl!

12:32.295 --> 12:34.286
You guys figure it out.
I'm taking a break.

12:34.464 --> 12:36.329
- That's good.
- Take a break?

12:36.499 --> 12:39.161
Yeah. I think even God
rested on the seventh day.

12:40.003 --> 12:41.732
Joey, if this takes seven days...

12:41.905 --> 12:45.898
...you'll be able to meet God
and ask him about it yourself.

12:52.816 --> 12:55.046
Big octopus.

13:03.326 --> 13:06.227
Oh, my God! I totally forgot.

13:06.396 --> 13:08.796
Well, can't someone else do it?

13:08.965 --> 13:11.331
But I have company.

13:14.070 --> 13:17.301
Look, that's all right.
I'll come in. Okay.

13:17.908 --> 13:20.342
I'm sorry,
but I have to go into work.

13:20.577 --> 13:24.240
It's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that I do him, so...

13:24.414 --> 13:26.814
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

13:27.284 --> 13:30.685
I'm a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.

13:30.854 --> 13:34.756
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

13:35.759 --> 13:39.126
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

13:42.332 --> 13:44.357
That's wild.

13:44.634 --> 13:48.730
- No, I had no idea.
- Alrighty.

13:49.639 --> 13:53.405
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you want to come with me.

13:53.576 --> 13:55.510
You mean, like, watch?

13:56.479 --> 14:00.677
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

14:00.850 --> 14:02.841
What are big sisters for?

14:03.286 --> 14:06.278
Well, I don't think this. You know?

14:06.456 --> 14:08.515
No. No, no.
I wouldn't do you myself.

14:08.725 --> 14:10.625
I mean, that would be weird.

14:12.062 --> 14:14.462
I'll get one of the
other girls to do it.

14:14.631 --> 14:17.191
This is so much fun!

14:18.134 --> 14:20.227
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

14:22.072 --> 14:25.439
Hey, do Monica and Rachel
work there?

14:27.277 --> 14:29.211
It's beautiful!

14:29.379 --> 14:32.906
It's like the first bathroom
floor there ever was.

14:34.751 --> 14:37.185
What are you going in there for?

14:37.354 --> 14:39.219
You want, like, a number?

14:42.659 --> 14:45.184
- Hey.
- Hi. Bye.

14:46.663 --> 14:49.257
Okay. I'm done with my choices.

14:49.466 --> 14:51.900
These are final.

14:52.869 --> 14:55.963
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah. Very official.

14:56.139 --> 15:00.337
Yeah. Well, you know, Chandler
printed it up on his computer.

15:00.510 --> 15:02.944
And who laminated it?

15:03.947 --> 15:05.972
That was me.

15:06.149 --> 15:07.844
All right, let me see.

15:08.485 --> 15:12.251
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

15:12.522 --> 15:13.819
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

15:14.858 --> 15:17.520
...Dorothy Hamill"?

15:22.332 --> 15:24.800
Hey, it's my list!

15:25.001 --> 15:29.062
You do realize she only spins
like that on ice?

15:37.947 --> 15:40.438
- What's going on?
- She broke my arm!

15:40.617 --> 15:43.450
- He touched my fanny.
- She touched mine first!

15:43.620 --> 15:45.110
That's my job!

15:45.288 --> 15:50.453
So, what's the deal? I can have sex
with you, but I can't touch you?

15:50.660 --> 15:54.027
- You can't have sex with her!
- Did you think I was a hooker?

15:54.197 --> 15:58.930
No, okay. I know. You're a masseuse.
It's cool. I'm not a cop!

16:01.071 --> 16:04.165
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he
can wait for five minutes.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.807
Fine.

16:05.975 --> 16:08.375
I don't like you.

16:09.412 --> 16:13.041
So that's what you thought I did?
God!

16:13.683 --> 16:15.446
That's not what I do!

16:15.885 --> 16:18.877
Wait, that's not what you do?

16:19.055 --> 16:21.046
No!

16:21.224 --> 16:22.782
Why would you think that?

16:22.959 --> 16:26.326
I don't know. This is the city,
you know? I just...

16:26.596 --> 16:27.858
I mean...

16:28.064 --> 16:29.463
...I don't know.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.902
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

16:36.272 --> 16:37.500
Wait.

16:37.674 --> 16:41.371
No, you're right.
No, it was perfect.

16:41.544 --> 16:45.241
I can't believe
I screwed it up so bad.

16:45.915 --> 16:49.851
- You thought it was perfect?
- Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

16:50.086 --> 16:52.714
...but you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

16:52.889 --> 16:56.757
Because we had all those
great talks, you know?

17:00.296 --> 17:03.060
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

17:04.033 --> 17:06.695
Well, you know, about
the tongue thing, you know?

17:06.903 --> 17:10.566
And how I told you about
my likes and my dislikes.

17:12.175 --> 17:17.238
How I like to melt stuff, and how
I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

17:18.314 --> 17:20.544
Right. Okay.

17:20.717 --> 17:27.054
I feel like I can really talk to you
because you're my sister, you know?

17:28.391 --> 17:31.019
Yeah. I guess I do.

17:31.194 --> 17:35.426
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

17:36.332 --> 17:39.961
Well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

17:40.336 --> 17:43.032
You hopped a little bit.

17:44.474 --> 17:47.739
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
You know, I'm really...

17:48.678 --> 17:50.612
Okay.

17:52.282 --> 17:55.911
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

17:56.085 --> 17:57.916
This?

17:58.087 --> 18:00.521
Oh, come on.
We went to Times Square.

18:00.757 --> 18:03.817
We found ninja stars. I almost
get my arm broken by a hooker...

18:04.027 --> 18:05.892
She's not a hooker.

18:06.062 --> 18:09.623
When I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.801
Phoebe, what's that?

18:21.978 --> 18:25.141
Frank Jr. Gave me this before he left.
A present.

18:25.315 --> 18:27.783
It used to belong to our dad.
His garage-door opener.

18:27.951 --> 18:30.112
Until Frank melted it.

18:32.555 --> 18:34.045
Cool!

18:39.996 --> 18:42.624
Sound the bell, gather up
all the men you can find.

18:42.799 --> 18:45.825
We got ourselves
an entertainment unit raising.

18:48.738 --> 18:50.831
No, seriously,
can you help us?

18:54.110 --> 18:55.805
Okay, on three!

18:55.979 --> 18:59.710
- One, two...
- Why don't we just go on two?

18:59.882 --> 19:02.544
- Why two?
- Because it's faster.

19:02.719 --> 19:06.018
I could've counted to three four times
without all the two talk.

19:06.189 --> 19:11.593
- All right, but in the future...
- Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

19:11.761 --> 19:15.720
- One, two...
- So we are going with two?

19:24.874 --> 19:27.604
A good job, Joe.

19:27.777 --> 19:30.507
Wow. It's big.

19:32.515 --> 19:35.279
So big it actually makes
our doors look smaller.

19:36.119 --> 19:40.283
- Maybe my ruler's wrong.
- Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

19:40.990 --> 19:45.450
It's not that bad. So it blocks a
little of your door, a little of mine.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.788
I got a better idea.

19:46.963 --> 19:50.558
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

19:53.770 --> 19:58.104
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.480
Arm hair stuck!
Arm hair stuck!

20:13.356 --> 20:15.517
Let me just see
if I've got this right.

20:15.692 --> 20:19.128
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy hazelnut...

20:19.295 --> 20:24.392
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

20:24.567 --> 20:26.000
Okay. Great.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.432
You freak.

20:34.377 --> 20:35.503
Thank you.

20:35.678 --> 20:37.942
A coffee to go, please.

20:41.551 --> 20:45.783
- Isabella Rossellini!
- Are you serious? Oh, my God!

20:45.988 --> 20:49.549
Damn! I cannot believe
I took her off my list.

20:49.726 --> 20:52.695
Why? Because otherwise
you'd go for it?

20:54.664 --> 20:56.689
Yeah, maybe.

20:56.866 --> 20:58.697
You lie.

20:59.068 --> 21:00.933
You don't think I'd go up to her?

21:01.104 --> 21:06.201
It took you 10 years to finally admit
you liked me.

21:06.943 --> 21:12.381
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated.

21:12.548 --> 21:16.882
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

21:17.787 --> 21:21.655
- Okay. Hold my cruller.
- Okay.

21:22.592 --> 21:24.526
Are you really gonna
let him do this?

21:24.694 --> 21:27.219
He's about to go hit
on Isabella Rossellini.

21:27.397 --> 21:30.059
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

21:35.271 --> 21:36.761
I'm Ross.

21:36.939 --> 21:40.636
You don't know me,
but I'm a big, big fan of yours.

21:40.810 --> 21:42.243
I mean...

21:42.412 --> 21:43.777
...Blue Velvet.

21:47.016 --> 21:50.816
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a cup of coffee.

21:50.987 --> 21:53.455
Or reimburse you for that one.

21:55.491 --> 21:57.721
Aren't you with that girl over there?

22:02.298 --> 22:03.925
Well, yeah, kind of.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.830
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.

22:07.003 --> 22:11.997
We each have this list of five famous
people, and you were one of mine.

22:12.175 --> 22:14.871
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.

22:15.044 --> 22:17.808
No, no, no.
It's flattering.

22:20.316 --> 22:24.343
- I don't know...
- Wait. Wait, Isabella.

22:24.554 --> 22:29.048
Don't dismiss this so fast. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

22:29.258 --> 22:31.385
Yeah, for you.

22:32.762 --> 22:34.559
- Is that the list?
- Yes.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.391
- Can I see it?
- No.

22:36.566 --> 22:38.864
- Come on.
- But... Okay.

22:39.502 --> 22:41.060
I'm not on the list!

22:41.237 --> 22:43.467
But that's not the final draft.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.940
It's laminated.

22:47.877 --> 22:50.539
Okay, see, you were on my list.

22:50.746 --> 22:53.180
But then my friend Chandler...

22:56.052 --> 22:59.180
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

22:59.355 --> 23:02.620
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

23:03.125 --> 23:06.617
You know, it's ironic
because I have a list...

23:06.796 --> 23:09.697
...of five goofy coffeehouse guys.

23:09.866 --> 23:15.270
And yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

23:22.044 --> 23:24.478
We're just gonna be friends.

23:28.451 --> 23:30.749
You know what?

23:30.920 --> 23:33.821
Bet you I could fit in there.

23:34.957 --> 23:37.517
I got 5 bucks says you can't.

23:38.761 --> 23:41.059
Get out your checkbook, mister.

23:41.697 --> 23:44.359
I think I have the cash.

23:49.505 --> 23:51.666
You are dog, man!

23:52.375 --> 23:54.639
I totally fit!

23:54.810 --> 23:56.937
Yeah. You got me.

23:57.113 --> 24:00.344
I'm out 5 big ones.

24:02.985 --> 24:04.247
There you go.

24:04.887 --> 24:06.514
Thank you.

24:10.159 --> 24:13.060
Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!

24:13.629 --> 24:16.154
Better luck next time, buddy!

24:16.332 --> 24:18.323
And the drinks are on me!

24:19.669 --> 24:20.500
