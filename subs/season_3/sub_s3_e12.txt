WEBVTT

00:03.448 --> 00:06.383
-Does everybody hate these shoes?
-Yeah.

00:06.818 --> 00:10.754
But don't worry. Nobody's gonna focus
on that if you wear that towel-dress.

00:12.624 --> 00:13.613
Tell him.

00:13.825 --> 00:18.091
lt's her first day at this new job.
You're not supposed to start with her.

00:19.064 --> 00:21.589
All right, l suppose l can wait a day.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.531
-What are you doing Friday?
-Why?

00:24.770 --> 00:27.534
l need you at a bachelor party
for my weird cousin, Albert.

00:27.706 --> 00:29.469
You know, he's the botanist?

00:29.641 --> 00:30.938
Oh, God!

00:31.610 --> 00:33.168
Botanists are such geeks.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.244
ls that a dinosaur tie?

00:42.187 --> 00:43.279
Morning!

00:43.655 --> 00:46.089
Rach, l'm here with the purses!

00:47.759 --> 00:50.421
lt must take you forever
to find your keys.

00:50.829 --> 00:52.194
Thank you, Pheebs.

00:52.431 --> 00:55.366
You're welcome. Please want
the one with the turtles.

00:55.534 --> 00:58.162
No, turtles scare me.
l don't need that today.

00:59.504 --> 01:02.064
Honey, just relax.
lt's gonna be fine.

01:02.341 --> 01:04.935
Why don't l come down there,
and l'll take you to lunch?

01:05.110 --> 01:07.772
Honey, thank you!
But Mark's taking me out.

01:08.747 --> 01:11.944
Mark? ls that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?

01:12.117 --> 01:15.553
Yeah, it's kind of like a ''good luck
on your first day'' sort of thing.

01:15.721 --> 01:16.949
ls this a lunch box?

01:17.923 --> 01:20.414
No, it's a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.

01:23.061 --> 01:25.461
-So can you make it on Friday?
-What?

01:25.631 --> 01:28.259
Yeah, l think so.
Why am l invited to this again?

01:28.433 --> 01:30.060
Apparently, Albert has no friends.

01:30.268 --> 01:32.236
He's very excited about
the bachelor party.

01:32.437 --> 01:35.770
l think, actually, he's only getting
married so he can see a stripper.

01:37.509 --> 01:40.967
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so clichê.

01:41.246 --> 01:43.908
Why don't you guys get a magician?

01:44.616 --> 01:48.416
Well, if a magician can open my beer
with his butt cheeks, then all right.

01:51.223 --> 01:52.247
The One With All the Jealousy

02:37.869 --> 02:40.997
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?

02:41.173 --> 02:43.971
You should've seen the hug he gave her
when she got the job!

02:44.209 --> 02:47.076
And he's really good-looking.

02:48.313 --> 02:50.747
-What am l gonna do?
-You don't do anything.

02:51.049 --> 02:53.574
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.

02:55.454 --> 02:56.512
Don't cry out loud.

03:00.459 --> 03:02.791
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical?

03:02.961 --> 03:06.488
l wanna say you, but it seems like
such an easy answer.

03:07.065 --> 03:10.899
lt is me! lt's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.

03:11.136 --> 03:14.628
So l think l'm gonna sing
''New York, New York'' ...

03:14.873 --> 03:17.569
...and ''l Left My Heart
in San Francisco.''

03:20.245 --> 03:23.976
Joey, l don't think
you get to pick the cities.

03:24.716 --> 03:27.844
-What?
-Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

03:29.588 --> 03:31.920
Who?

03:32.090 --> 03:33.990
l'll get you the Cliff Notes.

03:34.326 --> 03:37.693
-The what?
-The abridgment.

03:38.196 --> 03:40.926
Okay.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.262
The what?

03:47.439 --> 03:48.997
Then the style number...

03:49.574 --> 03:53.670
...the invoice number
and the shipping date.

03:53.845 --> 03:55.870
Good. Any questions so far?

03:56.414 --> 03:58.075
What kind of discount do we get?

03:58.917 --> 04:03.081
-Twenty percent.
-l love this job!

04:04.456 --> 04:06.720
-My first call!
-Here, let me.

04:07.659 --> 04:09.524
Rachel Greene's line.
How may l help you?

04:09.694 --> 04:10.956
Hi, is Rachel there?

04:11.129 --> 04:14.121
-And who may l say is calling?
-This is Ross.

04:14.299 --> 04:15.357
Ross of...?

04:16.201 --> 04:18.795
Of Ross and Rachel.

04:18.970 --> 04:21.131
Hi, it's Mark.

04:21.306 --> 04:23.240
-Hey, Mark.
-Hey.

04:23.475 --> 04:26.239
Hold on a second.
It's Ross.

04:27.379 --> 04:28.676
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

04:29.047 --> 04:31.447
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?

04:31.716 --> 04:33.445
Oh, he's just goofing around.

04:33.718 --> 04:36.710
Oh, that's funny.

04:37.789 --> 04:40.815
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?

04:40.992 --> 04:45.088
This is his office too. l told you,
we're Joanna's two assistants.

04:45.697 --> 04:47.528
Why does Joanna need two assistants?

04:47.833 --> 04:49.824
How lazy is she?

04:50.969 --> 04:53.130
Oh, my God! What did l just do?

04:53.338 --> 04:55.533
l think l just shipped 3000 bras
to Personnel!

04:55.774 --> 04:57.469
Honey, l gotta go!
Mark, l need you!

04:57.642 --> 04:59.974
Okay! Bye-bye!

05:01.813 --> 05:03.007
Ross!

05:03.181 --> 05:05.706
l'm sorry, sweetie.
l was just trying to--

05:05.984 --> 05:07.884
l was dialing another number.

05:21.399 --> 05:25.130
All right, l just got changed in 30
seconds so you could be alone with him.

05:25.303 --> 05:26.565
You better go for it.

05:26.738 --> 05:28.831
Please. l'm not going for anything.

05:29.007 --> 05:30.474
Well, if you don't, l will.

05:30.709 --> 05:32.370
Would you please go?

05:32.978 --> 05:34.912
'Night, Mon.

05:36.214 --> 05:38.239
'Night, Julio.

05:49.027 --> 05:50.756
Julio, someone left their book here.

05:51.730 --> 05:54.494
Actually, that is mine.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.497
What are you reading?

05:56.768 --> 06:01.171
Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?

06:01.339 --> 06:02.897
Have l read it?

06:04.409 --> 06:06.434
No. Are you enjoying it?

06:07.946 --> 06:10.744
l thought that l would,
but the translation's no good.

06:12.050 --> 06:13.847
You're a poet,
and you don't know it.

06:17.722 --> 06:19.417
Actually, l....

06:19.758 --> 06:20.986
l am a poet.

06:23.561 --> 06:25.620
So you do know it.

06:30.035 --> 06:34.062
So, what kind of things
do you write about?

06:34.439 --> 06:36.270
Things that move me:

06:36.741 --> 06:38.709
The shadow of a tree...

06:39.778 --> 06:41.006
...a child laughing...

06:43.048 --> 06:44.140
...or this lip.

06:44.816 --> 06:45.805
Mine?

06:46.818 --> 06:47.944
Right here?

06:49.721 --> 06:54.055
l could write an epic poem
about this lip.

06:59.731 --> 07:01.926
How would that go?

07:12.243 --> 07:14.905
Well, it didn't rhyme...

07:15.113 --> 07:16.137
...but l liked it.

07:35.433 --> 07:36.798
Lovely.

07:36.968 --> 07:38.230
Just lovely.

07:38.603 --> 07:40.002
Really? Thanks.

07:40.171 --> 07:43.698
Listen, Joey. We definitely want
to see you for the callback on Saturday.

07:44.109 --> 07:45.167
Excellent!

07:45.944 --> 07:47.002
-l'll be there.
-Okay.

07:47.278 --> 07:50.714
And listen, don't forget to bring
your jazz shoes for the dance audition.

07:54.786 --> 07:58.222
My agent said that
it wasn't a dancing part.

07:58.390 --> 08:01.188
Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.

08:01.459 --> 08:04.587
Believe me, with your dance background,
it'll be a piece of cake.

08:04.763 --> 08:08.062
''Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp''?

08:09.167 --> 08:12.000
''Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre''?

08:14.205 --> 08:17.504
Hey, everybody lies
on their rêsumê, okay?

08:17.709 --> 08:20.143
l wasn't one of
the Zoom kids either.

08:21.146 --> 08:23.410
Well, can you, like, dance at all?

08:23.648 --> 08:25.741
Yeah, l can dance.
You know....

08:34.626 --> 08:37.094
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:38.563 --> 08:39.791
What is that?

08:40.265 --> 08:43.894
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.

08:44.602 --> 08:46.832
l have to get that.
But, no, no.

08:48.673 --> 08:51.972
Hello. Hi.

08:52.577 --> 08:58.015
Yeah, listen, l'm in need of a stripper,
and l was told that you do that.

09:01.286 --> 09:04.881
Let me ask you this. What do you do
for the extra hundred?

09:06.091 --> 09:09.583
So would l have to provide the grapes?

09:10.228 --> 09:11.217
Hi.

09:11.863 --> 09:13.956
How was last night
with Julio, señorita?

09:14.232 --> 09:18.760
lt so was amazing. He's so sexy and
smart, which makes him even sexier.

09:18.937 --> 09:21.701
l gotta tell you this. Last night,
we were fooling around...

09:21.873 --> 09:24.865
...and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.

09:25.210 --> 09:28.646
Get out! l couldn't stop
if a meteor hit me.

09:30.515 --> 09:35.714
Okay, we have our stripper,
a Miss Crystal Chandelier.

09:35.887 --> 09:39.323
Sure, you name a kid that, what do you
expect them to grow up to be?

09:41.726 --> 09:44.422
Anyway, when he left, he forgot
to take the poem with him.

09:44.662 --> 09:49.190
Now, l am totally dense about poetry,
but l think this is pretty good.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.336
Check it out. Read it.

09:52.804 --> 09:55.898
''The Empty Vase.''
Translucent beauty--

09:56.074 --> 09:57.302
To yourself.

10:01.546 --> 10:03.138
You know what? That's pretty good.

10:03.314 --> 10:04.679
Good. l think so too.
Phoebe?

10:04.849 --> 10:05.975
Yeah.

10:06.151 --> 10:07.982
Great! l'm so glad you guys like it!

10:08.153 --> 10:10.917
-All right, l gotta go to work.
-Hold on. l'm not done.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.514
All right, give it back when
you're through.

10:13.858 --> 10:15.257
-See you guys.
-Bye-bye.

10:16.828 --> 10:19.160
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Poor Monica!

10:19.330 --> 10:20.763
What? What? What?

10:20.932 --> 10:23.833
What? He was with her
when he wrote this poem!

10:24.002 --> 10:27.369
Look! My vessel so lovely,
with nothing inside?

10:27.539 --> 10:30.303
Now that I've touched you,
you seem emptier still?

10:30.542 --> 10:33.602
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase!

10:33.778 --> 10:36.008
-Vase, vase?
-Monica's not an empty vase.

10:36.181 --> 10:38.172
You think vase?

10:38.750 --> 10:41.514
-You really think that's what he meant?
-Totally.

10:41.686 --> 10:44.280
Oh, God!
And she seems so happy too.

10:44.923 --> 10:46.481
Done.

10:48.092 --> 10:49.081
What happened?

10:49.260 --> 10:51.455
Joey, what do you think
this poem means?

10:51.829 --> 10:53.490
Monica's the vase, right?

10:55.300 --> 10:56.733
You are such a mystery to me.

11:08.379 --> 11:10.745
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

11:10.915 --> 11:14.646
Oh, yeah, sure! lt's right....

11:18.256 --> 11:19.985
What's that?

11:20.158 --> 11:22.422
lt's from Ross. lt's a Love Bug.

11:23.895 --> 11:27.422
Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.568
No, that's not what he's doing.

11:30.735 --> 11:32.066
He's just really romantic.

11:33.338 --> 11:36.171
-Excuse me. Are you Rachel Greene?
-Yes.

11:38.543 --> 11:39.532
One, two, three.

11:39.711 --> 11:42.680
Congratulations on your first week
At your brand-new job

11:43.348 --> 11:45.475
It won't be long
Before you're the boss

11:46.451 --> 11:49.511
And you know who will be there
To support you

11:49.754 --> 11:51.085
Your one and only boyfriend

11:51.356 --> 11:52.846
lt's nice to have a boyfriend!

11:53.091 --> 11:56.993
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!

12:05.503 --> 12:08.165
l'm hurt!
l'm actually hurt...

12:08.339 --> 12:12.366
...that you'd think l'd send you any of
those things out of anything but love.

12:12.543 --> 12:14.738
Hurt! Hurt!

12:14.912 --> 12:17.540
All right, Ross. l get it. You're hurt!

12:17.715 --> 12:19.910
Can't a guy send
a barbershop quartet...

12:20.151 --> 12:23.120
...to his girlfriend's office anymore?

12:24.555 --> 12:27.217
Oh, please!
Ross, it was so obvious.

12:27.425 --> 12:29.825
lt was like you were
marking your territory.

12:30.061 --> 12:34.225
You might as well have just come in
and peed all around my desk!

12:35.767 --> 12:37.826
l would never do that.

12:40.238 --> 12:42.297
Look, l know what's going
on here, okay?

12:42.507 --> 12:46.841
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.

12:47.011 --> 12:50.845
Yeah, well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.

12:51.015 --> 12:52.346
Mark's a genius.

12:52.517 --> 12:54.576
Why? How?
How is he a genius?

12:54.852 --> 12:56.513
Don't you see what's happening here?

12:56.688 --> 12:59.851
lnstead of hitting on her right away,
he's becoming her confidante.

13:00.024 --> 13:04.324
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to,
to complain about you.

13:06.764 --> 13:07.753
You okay over there?

13:08.032 --> 13:11.490
l tried taking a dance class today
to get ready for this callback tomorrow.

13:11.669 --> 13:14.536
-How'd it go?
-Knocked over a girl.

13:15.506 --> 13:18.737
Good work. Can we get back to the
Mark thing? What am l gonna do?

13:18.910 --> 13:20.844
Why don't you send her a musical bug?

13:21.012 --> 13:22.309
No, you already did that.

13:25.416 --> 13:28.044
All right, you're gonna have
to go there yourself now.

13:28.319 --> 13:31.117
-Make a few surprise visits.
-l don't know, you guys.

13:31.356 --> 13:33.620
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit and talk to us.

13:33.858 --> 13:36.486
Meanwhile, she is talking
to him about you.

13:36.661 --> 13:38.288
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

13:38.463 --> 13:42.559
She starts thinking, ''Maybe this is the
guy for me because he understands me.''

13:42.734 --> 13:44.827
And before you know it,
she's with him.

13:45.002 --> 13:48.165
And you'll be all, ''Oh, man!''

13:48.339 --> 13:50.102
And he'll be all, ''Yes!''

13:51.809 --> 13:54.937
And us, we'll be like, ''Oh, dude!''

13:56.948 --> 13:59.473
And pretty soon you'll be like:

13:59.650 --> 14:02.244
''Hi.''

14:02.420 --> 14:07.016
And, ''Well, l can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there.''

14:07.992 --> 14:10.790
And we'll be like, ''Man, get over it!
lt's been four years!''

14:13.898 --> 14:16.560
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?

14:19.604 --> 14:21.936
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff
for December.

14:22.106 --> 14:24.540
Wait, l've got something for you.

14:24.709 --> 14:27.109
-Mark.
-lt's okay. Rachel knows.

14:27.345 --> 14:29.245
Yeah, but even so.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.774
l can't help it.
l'm just crazy about you.

14:33.050 --> 14:36.019
Oh, that is so sweet!

14:37.889 --> 14:40.949
l know l'm Mr. lnappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.424
l mean, l see you walking around,
and l want to touch you and hold you.

14:44.962 --> 14:47.396
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.

14:47.565 --> 14:49.795
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!

14:49.967 --> 14:51.161
What is going on?

14:51.335 --> 14:54.168
What's going on?
l'll tell you what's going on!

14:54.338 --> 14:56.272
Ross!

15:00.711 --> 15:05.307
l have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

15:07.385 --> 15:09.910
What do l have to do
to get some service?

15:12.056 --> 15:13.956
Hi, Rach.

15:21.999 --> 15:25.696
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?

15:29.640 --> 15:30.971
Joey, l've got a problem.

15:31.242 --> 15:33.301
l just got a call
from my dance captain.

15:33.578 --> 15:36.638
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't get out of Long lsland.

15:36.814 --> 15:38.941
So does that mean the audition's off?

15:39.150 --> 15:42.517
Listen, Joey. Seeing as you've got
the most experience...

15:42.687 --> 15:45.747
...l want you to take these dancers
and teach them the combination.

15:48.025 --> 15:49.049
What?

15:49.227 --> 15:53.129
Joey, come on. lt's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand...

15:53.297 --> 15:55.060
...head, head...

15:55.233 --> 15:59.795
...up, pas de bourrêe, pas de bourrêe,
big turn here, rond de jambe.

16:00.071 --> 16:02.096
Slide, step, step...

16:02.273 --> 16:04.935
...and jazz hands!

16:07.044 --> 16:10.605
lt's steppity-step and jazz hands.

16:10.948 --> 16:12.210
Have fun.

16:13.017 --> 16:14.882
Bye.

16:17.989 --> 16:19.320
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:19.490 --> 16:20.889
What are you wrapping?

16:21.325 --> 16:23.520
Look what l got Julio.

16:26.764 --> 16:27.958
Yeah, it's a vase.

16:28.132 --> 16:31.067
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.

16:31.269 --> 16:33.760
Not exactly like
the one in the poem.

16:34.906 --> 16:35.895
What do you mean?

16:36.407 --> 16:39.342
Remember how you said you were
really dense about poetry?

16:45.883 --> 16:48.010
So l'm just an empty vase?

16:48.219 --> 16:49.777
What?

16:49.954 --> 16:52.445
So, l don't read as many
important books as you do.

16:52.623 --> 16:57.083
And l don't write trick poems
that aren't actually what they seem.

16:57.261 --> 16:59.786
And you know what?
l get excited about stupid stuff...

16:59.964 --> 17:02.364
...like when my People magazine
comes on Saturday...

17:02.533 --> 17:05.263
...and the new
Hold Everything catalog.

17:05.469 --> 17:09.735
But that doesn't mean l'm empty. l care
about things, like friends and family.

17:09.907 --> 17:13.866
You have no right to make that kind of
judgment! You don't even know me!

17:14.478 --> 17:16.571
The poem is not about you.

17:18.082 --> 17:21.745
-What?
-''The Empty Vase'' is not about you.

17:21.953 --> 17:26.447
My baby preciosa, you make me so sad
that you would think this.

17:29.427 --> 17:31.918
l'm sorry. lt's....
My friend Phoebe said--

17:32.096 --> 17:35.554
No, it's....
lt's about all women.

17:37.201 --> 17:40.500
Well, all American women.

17:42.473 --> 17:43.735
You feel better now?

17:49.480 --> 17:50.970
All right, let's do it.

18:11.669 --> 18:12.863
What was that?

18:13.704 --> 18:16.172
l know. lt's the best
l could get out of them.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.342
Well, people!

18:19.610 --> 18:21.703
People, people, people!

18:22.213 --> 18:27.082
Let's try it again. And this time,
let's everybody watch Joey.

18:28.619 --> 18:30.143
Show them how it's done.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.151
Count it off, Mack.

18:49.974 --> 18:52.670
Did you have fun at
the bachelor party last night?

18:52.843 --> 18:55.869
Yeah, look what l got!
See, she's fully dressed, right?

18:56.147 --> 18:59.548
And then you click it,
and she's naked!

19:01.352 --> 19:04.014
And then you click it again,
and she's dressed.

19:04.188 --> 19:06.554
She's a business woman,
walking down the street.

19:06.724 --> 19:09.352
She's window shopping,
and she's naked!

19:16.967 --> 19:18.059
Hi.

19:18.769 --> 19:20.464
Hello.

19:21.405 --> 19:24.238
You know what? l'm gonna spend
some alone time with the pen.

19:33.384 --> 19:36.046
l'm sorry. l was an idiot.

19:36.587 --> 19:37.952
A big idiot.

19:38.189 --> 19:39.588
A big idiot.

19:40.858 --> 19:45.352
lt's just you have to realize this whole
Mark thing is really hard for me.

19:45.896 --> 19:49.297
Honey, why is it hard? We've
been together for almost a year now.

19:50.301 --> 19:52.769
Well, l was with Carol
for, like, eight years.

19:52.937 --> 19:55.428
And l lost her.

19:56.607 --> 19:59.576
And now, if it's possible,
l think l love you even more.

20:00.478 --> 20:03.379
So it's hard for me
to believe l'm not gonna...

20:03.581 --> 20:07.381
...well, that someone else isn't
gonna take you away.

20:07.551 --> 20:10.247
Let it be me. Let it be me!

20:15.559 --> 20:18.551
Honey, that's very sweet.

20:18.763 --> 20:22.597
lt just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other...

20:22.800 --> 20:25.268
...and trust each other, like we do...

20:25.469 --> 20:27.596
...there's no reason to be jealous.

20:35.513 --> 20:37.981
l gotta get going.
Bye, Chandler.

20:38.516 --> 20:43.283
Okay, Ross, this pen's getting kind of
boring. Can you pick me up some porn?

20:46.257 --> 20:47.246
Where you going?

20:47.424 --> 20:50.222
l've gotta go pick up Ben.
We got a play-date this afternoon.

20:50.928 --> 20:52.020
With who?

20:52.263 --> 20:54.823
Just this woman l met
last night at the party.

20:55.032 --> 20:56.761
There was a woman at--?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.262
The stripper?

21:01.472 --> 21:05.465
-Yeah.
-You have a play-date with a stripper?

21:06.777 --> 21:08.642
Man, l gotta get a kid!

21:15.486 --> 21:19.479
Yeah, we started talking
after she did her thing...

21:19.657 --> 21:22.057
...and it turns out she's got a boy
about Ben's age.

21:22.226 --> 21:25.320
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.

21:25.996 --> 21:28.055
-ls that okay?
-Sure. ls she married?

21:28.299 --> 21:30.096
No.

21:35.506 --> 21:36.495
Are you jealous?

21:37.842 --> 21:41.710
No, l just don't see why she has
to play with you. That's all.

21:41.879 --> 21:47.476
l mean, doesn't she, you know, have any
other stripper-mom friends of her own?

21:50.354 --> 21:52.549
You are totally jealous!

21:53.023 --> 21:56.220
l'm not jealous, all right.
This is about...

21:58.095 --> 22:01.223
...people feeling certain things...

22:01.498 --> 22:03.056
...you know, about...

22:03.767 --> 22:07.032
...strippers. And, you know....

22:07.271 --> 22:08.431
l love you too.

22:08.939 --> 22:09.928
Bye.

22:10.374 --> 22:11.773
Wait, wait, wait!

22:11.942 --> 22:13.637
What?

22:25.890 --> 22:29.724
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours.

22:30.394 --> 22:34.763
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him to a stripper.

22:36.734 --> 22:41.137
All right, l'm jealous.
l'm jealous!

22:41.305 --> 22:46.004
''Oh, no. Chandler, please don't.
No, l beg of you to not--''

22:50.147 --> 22:52.638
ls there a Julio here?

22:53.484 --> 22:55.418
l am Julio.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.610
Mr. Pretentious

22:58.322 --> 23:01.223
You think there's no one finer
Your poems are unpublished

23:01.625 --> 23:03.388
And you work in a diner

23:03.627 --> 23:08.030
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head

23:08.632 --> 23:11.294
-You are just a butt-munch
-No one likes a butt-munch!

23:11.468 --> 23:15.700
And you're also bad in bed

23:19.376 --> 23:20.365
