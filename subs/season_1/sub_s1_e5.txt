WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:03.900
Let it go. It's not a big deal.

00:04.104 --> 00:09.041
Not a big deal? It's amazing. You <br/>reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!

00:09.242 --> 00:11.403
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

00:11.878 --> 00:16.645
As far as I know, guys don't do <br/>anything that comes close. Right?

00:16.850 --> 00:19.876
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.644
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.718
Know what blows my mind?

00:25.925 --> 00:29.122
Women can see breasts <br/>anytime they want.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.562
You look down, <br/>and there they are.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.702
How you get any work done <br/>is beyond me.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.299
I don't get how guys can do <br/>so many mean things...

00:41.508 --> 00:43.908
...and not even care.

00:49.682 --> 00:52.776
-Multiple orgasms! <br/>-There you go.

00:57.490 --> 01:00.015
The One With the <br/>East German Laundry Detergent

01:45.572 --> 01:47.437
Saturday night. The big night!

01:47.640 --> 01:51.542
Date night! <br/>Saturday night. Saturday night!

01:52.979 --> 01:55.174
-No plans, huh? <br/>-Not a one!

01:56.082 --> 01:58.209
Not even breaking up with Janice?

01:58.384 --> 02:01.683
Right, right. Shut up.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.581
Chandler, nobody likes <br/>breaking up with someone.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.694
Except for Kevin Millmore, <br/>may he rot in hell.

02:09.929 --> 02:13.626
-You just gotta do it. <br/>-I know. But it's just so hard.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.768
You're sitting there with her. <br/>She has no idea.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.495
You finally get up <br/>the courage to do it.

02:19.706 --> 02:24.370
There's that awkward moment <br/>when you've handed her the note.

02:26.179 --> 02:30.912
You try to run out of the restaurant <br/>before she's finished the note.

02:31.284 --> 02:37.223
Why do you have to break up with her? <br/>Be a man. Just stop calling.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.650
If you want, I'll do it with you.

02:41.027 --> 02:44.485
She'd feel like <br/>we're ganging up on her.

02:44.697 --> 02:47.393
You dump Janice, <br/>I'll dump T ony.

02:47.700 --> 02:52.069
-You're breaking up with T ony? <br/>-He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.

02:52.305 --> 02:56.605
I don't know if it's me or <br/>his hunger strike, I don't know.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.471
Do you want anything else?

02:59.679 --> 03:04.207
You had a nutty, chocolate-y, <br/>kind of cake-y, pie thing that

03:05.618 --> 03:08.587
Nothing. I' m fine.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.390
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

03:12.592 --> 03:16.528
My father wants to give me <br/>a Mercedes convertible.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.994
That guy, he burns me up.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.397
Yeah, it's a Mercedes <br/>if I move back home.

03:23.603 --> 03:26.504
It was horrible! <br/>He called me "young lady. "

03:26.706 --> 03:29.732
I hate when my father <br/>calls me that.

03:30.243 --> 03:33.508
Did he say <br/>"You' re not up to this" again?

03:33.713 --> 03:36.705
I got the extended version <br/>with choruses of...

03:36.916 --> 03:40.181
... "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "

03:43.890 --> 03:45.380
Hi, Joey.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.790
Oh, my God! Angela!

03:47.994 --> 03:51.157
Wow! Being dumped <br/>by you agrees with her.

03:51.397 --> 03:56.300
-Are you gonna go over there? <br/>-No. Yeah. No.

03:56.803 --> 04:00.170
Okay, but not yet. <br/>I don't wanna seem too eager.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.542
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

04:05.745 --> 04:09.181
...three Mississippi. <br/>That seems pretty cool.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.712
-Hey, Angela. <br/>-Joey.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.252
You look good.

04:16.623 --> 04:20.992
That's because l' m wearing a dress <br/>that accents my boobs.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.532
You don't say.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.966
So, Rachel, what are you <br/>doing tonight?

04:33.172 --> 04:37.302
Big glamour night. <br/>Me and Monica at Launderama.

04:38.177 --> 04:43.740
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? <br/>Guess who's doing laundry there too?

04:44.350 --> 04:46.341
-Who? <br/>-Me!

04:46.552 --> 04:48.520
Was that not clear?

04:51.791 --> 04:53.122
Why don't...?

04:53.326 --> 04:56.454
Why don't I just <br/>join you both there?

04:56.663 --> 04:59.791
Don't you have a laundry room <br/>in your building?

05:00.833 --> 05:02.926
Yes.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.537
I do have a laundry room <br/>in my building.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.302
But there's a rat problem.

05:10.843 --> 05:14.074
Apparently, they're attracted <br/>to dryer sheets.

05:14.314 --> 05:19.149
They're going in fine, <br/>but they're coming out all fluffy.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.616
-Anyway, 7-ish? <br/>-Sure.

05:27.660 --> 05:32.427
-Forget it. I' m with Bob now. <br/>-Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

05:32.632 --> 05:37.399
Bob is great. He's smart, <br/>sophisticated, and he has a real job.

05:37.603 --> 05:41.403
You go on three auditions a month <br/>and you' re an actor. Bob

05:41.607 --> 05:44.838
Come on! We were great together.

05:45.011 --> 05:49.778
And not just at the fun stuff, <br/>but, like, talking too.

05:52.785 --> 05:57.279
Sorry, Joey. You said, <br/>" Let's be friends. " So guess what?

05:57.490 --> 05:59.617
-What? <br/>-We' re just friends.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.525
Fine. Fine.

06:01.794 --> 06:05.594
Why don't the four of us have <br/>dinner tonight? As friends.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.129
What "four of us"?

06:07.367 --> 06:11.497
You and Bob, <br/>and me and my girlfriend...

06:12.739 --> 06:13.728
... Monica.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.704
I' m telling you, <br/>this guy's perfect for you.

06:16.909 --> 06:20.845
Forget it! Not after your cousin <br/>who could belch the alphabet.

06:21.614 --> 06:25.448
Come on, this guy's great. <br/>His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

06:25.718 --> 06:29.119
... brother. He's smart, <br/>he's sophisticated...

06:29.389 --> 06:31.118
...and he has a real job.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.418
I go on three auditions a month <br/>and say l' m an actor, but he's

06:35.628 --> 06:37.095
-God help us. <br/>-What?

06:37.296 --> 06:39.958
Ugly Naked Guy <br/>is laying kitchen tile.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.069
Look, l' m asking a favor here.

06:46.272 --> 06:50.971
If I do this for her brother, <br/>maybe Angela will come back to me.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.409
What's going on? <br/>You go out with tons of girls.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.742
I know, but Angela's different.

06:57.950 --> 07:03.411
She's like one of a kind, <br/>like a snowflake or....

07:05.057 --> 07:08.458
-Something else like a snowflake? <br/>-Yeah, yeah.

07:08.861 --> 07:13.423
Look, I made a huge mistake. <br/>I never should've broke up with her.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.931
Will you help me? Please?

07:23.676 --> 07:27.908
Hold on a sec. <br/>You need to not touch any of those.

07:28.548 --> 07:29.981
Okay, bye.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.719
Monica's not coming. <br/>It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.682
Hold on, camper. <br/>You've thought this through?

07:39.959 --> 07:43.486
It's laundry. <br/>The thinking-through is minimal.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.390
Just you and Rachel? <br/>Just you two?

07:46.599 --> 07:50.091
This is a date. <br/>You're going on a date.

07:50.703 --> 07:56.039
-Uh-uh. <br/>-Uh-huh.

07:56.442 --> 08:01.539
-I haven't done that in a while. <br/>-ls it a date if she doesn't know?

08:01.747 --> 08:06.480
Yes, absolutely. <br/>Saturday night, all rules apply.

08:06.853 --> 08:10.653
What are you saying? I should <br/>shave again? Pick up some wine?

08:10.823 --> 08:14.486
Well, you may wanna rethink <br/>the dirty underwear.

08:15.528 --> 08:20.124
It's the first time she'll see <br/>your underwear. You want it dirty?

08:23.936 --> 08:25.995
No.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.899
And the fabric softener?

08:29.141 --> 08:33.237
Okay, now what is wrong <br/>with my Snuggles?

08:33.546 --> 08:37.073
What? It says I'm a sensitive, <br/>warm kind of guy.

08:37.283 --> 08:40.411
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

08:41.954 --> 08:45.151
-I'll pick something else up. <br/>-There you go.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.117
Thank you.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.594
What does Bob look like? <br/>Is he tall, short?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.191
Yep.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.293
-Which? <br/>-Which what?

09:00.740 --> 09:04.176
-You've never met Bob, have you? <br/>-No, but

09:04.377 --> 09:08.643
-For all we know, he's horribly <br/>-Hey, Joey!

09:08.881 --> 09:12.977
Horribly attractive. <br/>I'll be shutting up now.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.453
Where are they? Where are they?

09:19.725 --> 09:23.422
This is nice. We never <br/>do anything, just the two of us.

09:23.629 --> 09:28.157
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent <br/>a car, run over some puppies.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.835
I don't wanna do that.

09:32.371 --> 09:35.067
-Here we go. <br/>-Have a good breakup.

09:36.742 --> 09:40.473
-Hey, Janice. <br/>-My God, I am so glad you called me.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.741
I had the most supremely awful day.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.585
That's not good.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.980
Can I get an espresso <br/>and a latte over here?

09:51.190 --> 09:55.354
We got the proofs from the shoot <br/>with the vegetables. They sucked.

09:55.561 --> 09:58.621
I blew off the afternoon. <br/>I went shopping.

09:58.831 --> 10:01.732
And I got you....

10:02.001 --> 10:04.936
I'm looking. I'm looking.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.999
I' m looking.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.504
-I got you <br/>-What?

10:09.742 --> 10:13.405
-What? <br/>-What did you get me there?

10:13.713 --> 10:16.238
I got you...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.641
...these.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.819
Bullwinkle socks.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.488
-That's sweet. <br/>-I knew you had Rockys.

10:23.689 --> 10:29.127
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle <br/>or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.924
Moose and squirrel. <br/>Whatever you want.

10:37.269 --> 10:41.501
I'm gonna get another espresso. <br/>More latte?

10:43.109 --> 10:46.408
No, l' m still working on mine.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.611
-That's it? <br/>-Yeah, it was really hard.

10:53.953 --> 10:58.720
-Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal. <br/>-You weren't there.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.454
-Sorry. <br/>-How are things going?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.929
Going? Things are not going. <br/>She got me socks.

11:08.134 --> 11:13.367
These go with your Rockys. She really <br/>cares about you l' m sorry.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.321
Coming through. Move. Move!

11:33.893 --> 11:37.294
Excuse me! I was kind of <br/>using that machine.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.929
Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not.

11:41.133 --> 11:44.034
But I saved it. <br/>I put my basket on top.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.761
I'm sorry. <br/>Is that your basket?

11:46.972 --> 11:51.409
It's pretty. <br/>Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

11:52.478 --> 11:53.570
What?

11:54.680 --> 11:57.945
No suds, no save, okay?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.187
What's going on?

12:02.388 --> 12:06.222
Nothing. This horrible woman <br/>just took my machine.

12:06.425 --> 12:07.892
Was your basket on top?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.355
-Yeah, but there were no suds. <br/>-So?

12:10.663 --> 12:14.394
-You know, no suds, no save. <br/>-No suds, no Excuse me.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.536
Hold on a second! <br/>This is my friend's machine.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.068
Hey, hey, hey! <br/>Her stuff wasn't in it!

12:21.240 --> 12:25.233
Hey, hey, hey! That's not <br/>the rule, and you know it!

12:35.721 --> 12:37.348
All right. Show's over.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.883
Nothing to see here.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.023
Okay. Let's do laundry.

12:47.266 --> 12:51.100
That was amazing! <br/>I can't even send back soup.

12:51.303 --> 12:56.605
Well, that's because you' re <br/>such a sweet, gentle....

12:58.077 --> 13:02.104
Do you? Do you? <br/>Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.614
-What's that? <br/>-Uberweiss.

13:08.821 --> 13:12.120
It's new. It's German. <br/>It's extra tough!

13:14.226 --> 13:17.627
Rach, are you gonna separate those?

13:17.830 --> 13:22.529
Oh, God. <br/>Am I being a total laundry spaz?

13:22.735 --> 13:27.968
Am I supposed to use one machine <br/>for shirts and another for pants?

13:30.276 --> 13:33.336
Have you never done this before?

13:33.512 --> 13:37.778
Well, not myself. <br/>But I know other people that have.

13:38.517 --> 13:42.146
Okay. You caught me. <br/>I'm a laundry virgin.

13:43.055 --> 13:47.617
Don't worry. <br/>I'll use the gentle cycle.

13:50.896 --> 13:55.595
Basically, you wanna use <br/>one machine for all your whites.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.269
A whole other machine <br/>for your colors.

13:58.470 --> 14:02.964
And a third for your...

14:03.175 --> 14:05.735
...delicates. <br/>That would be your bras...

14:06.011 --> 14:09.503
...and your underpanty things.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.676
These are white cotton panties.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.788
Would they go with whites <br/>or with delicates?

14:17.990 --> 14:20.652
That would be a judgment call.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.095
He's so cute!

14:28.934 --> 14:30.595
Where did you grow up?

14:30.903 --> 14:33.428
-Brooklyn Heights. <br/>-Cleveland.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.404
-How'd that happen? <br/>-My God!

14:36.842 --> 14:38.207
What?

14:38.744 --> 14:43.238
I suddenly had the feeling <br/>I was falling.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.207
But I'm not.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.956
So, you and Angela, huh?

14:56.161 --> 15:00.154
-Yep. Pretty much. <br/>-You' re a lucky man.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.430
Know what I miss most about her?

15:03.669 --> 15:07.571
That cute nibbly noise <br/>she makes when she eats.

15:07.773 --> 15:10.537
Like a happy little squirrel...

15:10.743 --> 15:12.734
...or a weasel.

15:13.979 --> 15:17.915
-I never really noticed. <br/>-Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.708
Monica. Monica is great.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.216
Yeah, she is.

15:23.455 --> 15:27.152
But it's not gonna last.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.487
She's too much for me in bed.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.760
Sexually.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.296
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.971
Yeah, isn't he?

15:40.172 --> 15:45.804
It's great to meet a smart, funny guy <br/>who's emotionally older than 8.

15:46.011 --> 15:50.948
You know what else? <br/>He's unbelievable in bed!

15:53.619 --> 15:58.056
My brother never even told me <br/>when he lost his virginity.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.223
That's nice.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.390
You can. It's like <br/>pulling off a Band-Aid.

16:09.601 --> 16:13.594
Just do it really fast, <br/>and then the wound is exposed.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.840
Go! Go!

16:28.287 --> 16:30.414
Hi, Janice.

16:30.889 --> 16:34.620
Here we go. I don't think <br/>we should go out anymore.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.835
All right.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.232
Well, there you go.

16:50.442 --> 16:53.639
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.406
This isn't about you.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.983
I know! It's about <br/>your fear of commitment.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.949
I' m not afraid.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.486
-Please. <br/>-I don't!

17:04.690 --> 17:08.786
-I don't! I' m ready to commit anytime. <br/>-Really?

17:09.561 --> 17:11.893
I know this is gonna sound stupid...

17:12.097 --> 17:14.691
... but I feel that if I can do this...

17:14.900 --> 17:18.233
...if I can actually do <br/>my own laundry...

17:18.437 --> 17:21.201
...there isn't anything I can't do.

17:21.407 --> 17:24.808
That does not sound stupid to me.

17:25.010 --> 17:29.174
The first time I had to cook <br/>for myself after Carol left me

17:29.381 --> 17:33.715
I'm sorry, that's all the time <br/>we have. Next on Ross....

17:34.920 --> 17:36.285
-Uh-oh. <br/>-What?

17:36.488 --> 17:37.682
Uh-oh....

17:37.890 --> 17:41.121
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.988
It's a song.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.061
The laundry song we sing.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.466
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

17:51.336 --> 17:53.668
-What's the matter? <br/>-Nothing.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.236
The laundry's done

17:55.507 --> 17:56.599
Come on, show me.

17:56.875 --> 18:02.438
It's just that you left a red sock <br/>with your whites, and now...

18:03.582 --> 18:06.483
...everything's kind of pink.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.609
Everything's pink?

18:08.887 --> 18:11.651
Except for the red sock, <br/>which is still red.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.690
Don't be upset. <br/>It can happen to anyone.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.758
But it happened to me.

18:16.995 --> 18:20.556
God, I'm gonna look like <br/>a big Marshmallow Peep!

18:20.799 --> 18:22.596
What am I doing?

18:22.901 --> 18:25.995
My father's right! <br/>I can't live on my own.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.240
I can't even do laundry!

18:40.252 --> 18:45.519
Something went wrong with Underdog <br/>and they couldn't inflate his head.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.858
So anyway...

18:48.760 --> 18:52.457
...his head is flopping <br/>down Broadway, right?

18:52.664 --> 18:57.897
And I'm thinking <br/>how inappropriate this is.

18:58.103 --> 19:02.563
Something's in my eye. Could we <br/>check it in the light, please?

19:05.377 --> 19:06.810
-Oh, my God! <br/>-What?

19:07.079 --> 19:09.980
Were we at the same table? <br/>It's like...

19:10.182 --> 19:12.946
...cocktails in Appalachia.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.918
-They' re close. <br/>-Close? Her tongue's in his ear.

19:21.727 --> 19:25.754
Like you've never got <br/>a little rambunctious with Ross.

19:26.932 --> 19:30.629
Joey, this is sick. <br/>It's disgusting. It's...

19:31.470 --> 19:33.131
... not really true' is it?

19:33.405 --> 19:35.100
Who's to say what's true?

19:35.374 --> 19:39.310
-What were you thinking? <br/>-l' m not proud of this, okay?

19:39.511 --> 19:42.537
Well, maybe I am a little.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.880
-l' m out of here! <br/>-Wait!

19:45.083 --> 19:48.644
You like him. I want her. <br/>He likes you.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.389
-Really? <br/>-Yeah.

19:51.590 --> 19:55.253
If we put our heads together, <br/>between the two of us...

19:55.494 --> 19:57.985
...we can break them up.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.833
I' m sorry. <br/>I can't believe I did this.

20:03.068 --> 20:07.164
I couldn't stop laughing <br/>at your Norman Mailer story.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.542
Waiter? One more plate of <br/>chicken wings over here.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.718
Here's the thing. <br/>We're different.

20:24.890 --> 20:28.223
I'm bing, bing, bing. <br/>You' re boom, boom, boom.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.984
Oh, my God! I' m so sorry!

20:31.496 --> 20:33.623
Are you okay?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.694
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.063
I'll be right back.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.138
I hit her in the eye! <br/>In the eye!

20:43.408 --> 20:46.935
This is the worst breakup <br/>in the history of the world!

20:47.145 --> 20:49.739
Oh, my God!

20:51.083 --> 20:54.917
-How many have you had? <br/>-I don't know. A million!

20:55.787 --> 21:00.019
Chandler, easy, easy. <br/>Go to your happy place.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.960
-l' m fine, l' m fine. <br/>-All right.

21:05.163 --> 21:10.123
-l' m not fine. Here she is. <br/>-Wait here, okay? Breathe.

21:28.086 --> 21:31.681
-How do you do that? <br/>-It's like a gift.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.658
We should always break up together.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.226
I'd like that!

21:40.165 --> 21:43.225
The clothes are clean. <br/>That's the important part.

21:43.435 --> 21:48.338
I guess. Except everything <br/>looks like jammies now.

21:52.978 --> 21:57.244
I'm sorry. <br/>Excuse me. We had this cart.

21:57.449 --> 22:00.145
I had a 24-inch waist. <br/>You lose things.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.650
Now, come on. <br/>Get out of my way.

22:02.888 --> 22:06.585
I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't <br/>being clear. This was our cart.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.726
There weren't clothes in it!

22:08.994 --> 22:11.622
Hey, hey, hey, hey! <br/>Quit making up rules!

22:11.830 --> 22:14.890
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.629
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it...

22:17.836 --> 22:20.634
...you' re gonna have <br/>to take me with it!

22:27.679 --> 22:31.080
-Yes! Did you see that? <br/>-You were incredible.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.808
A brand-new woman, <br/>ladies and gentlemen.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.477
Thank you. I could not have <br/>done this without you.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.288
More clothes in the dryer?

22:49.301 --> 22:51.895
-I'm fine. I'm fine. <br/>-Are you sure?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.808
-Are you sure you' re okay? <br/>-Yeah.

22:58.009 --> 23:01.103
-Does it still hurt? <br/>-Yeah.

23:02.614 --> 23:07.210
What a neat idea! All your <br/>clothes match. I' m gonna do this.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.652
-How'd it go? <br/>-Excellent!

23:11.990 --> 23:16.427
We ripped that couple apart <br/>and kept the pieces for ourselves.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.924
What a beautiful story.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.459
-I'm fine, by the way. <br/>-I'm sorry.

23:24.669 --> 23:27.661
-Where's Chandler? <br/>-He needed time to grieve.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.171
I' m free! I' m free!

23:32.177 --> 23:34.236
That ought to do it.
