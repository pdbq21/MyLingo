00:01.301 --> 00:03.997
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

00:04.304 --> 00:07.569
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

00:08.708 --> 00:12.405
Oh, my God! Don't look now.
Behind you there's a guy...

00:12.612 --> 00:16.878
...who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.012
Come to mama.

00:20.653 --> 00:23.121
He's coming.
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.586
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.786
-We should do something. Whistle.
-I' m not whistling.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.019
Come on, do it!

00:30.230 --> 00:32.425
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.169
I can't believe you did that.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.268
The One With Mrs. Bing

01:28.088 --> 01:30.682
-It's all my fault.
-No, it's mine.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.551
Why did I whoo-hoo?

01:32.759 --> 01:35.057
Was I hoping
he'd turn around and say...

01:35.261 --> 01:38.424
... " I love that sound.
I must have you now"?

01:39.165 --> 01:41.998
I wish there was something
we could do.

01:44.571 --> 01:45.765
Hello, coma guy.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.666
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!

01:49.876 --> 01:51.070
What are you doing?

01:51.344 --> 01:53.244
Maybe nobody's tried this.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.381
I wish we at least knew his name.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.315
I hate that they're
calling him John Doe.

02:01.521 --> 02:05.116
It's so sad. It's like he's a deer,
a female deer.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.986
Oh, I was gonna stop.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.257
Look at that face.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.726
Even sleeping he looks smart.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.391
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.

02:17.871 --> 02:22.035
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.833
And he can dance.

02:24.577 --> 02:28.877
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening...

02:29.082 --> 02:30.845
... not saying, " I understand "...

02:31.084 --> 02:34.144
... but really wondering
what you look like naked.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.251
I wish all guys could be like him.

02:41.027 --> 02:42.085
I know.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.200
You don't even know this guy.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.963
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.235
He doesn't have anyone.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.601
We feel kind of responsible.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.835
I can't believe you said "whoo-hoo. "

03:01.514 --> 03:03.004
I don't even say "whoo-hoo. "

03:03.316 --> 03:04.840
Oh, she's coming up.

03:05.051 --> 03:09.784
When we return, we'll talk with
the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.082
Put the kids to bed for this one.

03:12.325 --> 03:15.852
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.027
No way.

03:17.564 --> 03:21.193
-She's your mom.
-Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.961
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.435
I gotta tell you,
I love your mom's books.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.371
I can't get on a plane without one.
This is so cool.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.046
You wouldn't think so
if you were 11...

03:35.281 --> 03:39.775
...and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.580
I remember page 79.

03:42.789 --> 03:47.192
The thing after the opera
with the girl with the trick hip?

03:49.696 --> 03:51.926
I love your mom.
I think she's a blast.

03:52.198 --> 03:53.995
That's because she's not your mom.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.598
Oh, please. She's the

03:55.802 --> 03:57.633
Hi, sweetie.

03:59.505 --> 04:02.338
When did "Rigatoni" get back from Rome?

04:03.776 --> 04:05.107
-Last night.
-Really?

04:05.345 --> 04:08.576
So, his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

04:08.848 --> 04:10.713
Just a dream I had.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.176
But, phew!

04:13.519 --> 04:14.850
Hey, she's on.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.515
Nora Bing.

04:21.027 --> 04:25.521
Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?

04:25.865 --> 04:27.457
Your mom was arrested?

04:27.667 --> 04:29.658
I'm busy beaming with pride.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.233
This is kind of embarrassing...

04:33.306 --> 04:36.639
...but occasionally, after
I've been intimate with a man...

04:37.043 --> 04:39.341
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

04:40.413 --> 04:43.678
...I just get this craving
for kung pao chicken.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.976
That's too much information.

04:49.989 --> 04:54.119
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.353
Oh, God, I love her!

04:58.564 --> 05:01.032
I think I' m having a stroke.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.065
So how is your book tour going?

05:05.305 --> 05:09.298
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.736
But I get to see my son, who I love.

05:13.579 --> 05:17.310
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

05:17.717 --> 05:21.653
Don't take this wrong, I just
don't see you as a mom.

05:21.854 --> 05:25.756
-I don't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.383
I bought my son his first condoms.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.766
And then he burst into flames.

05:45.478 --> 05:49.778
Let's see. Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

05:50.049 --> 05:54.884
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.083
And teams played sports.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.117
What about Glen?

06:26.486 --> 06:27.714
He could be a Glen.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.785
Not special enough.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.221
How about Agamemnon?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.851
Way too special.

06:42.935 --> 06:45.233
I'm famished. What do I want?

06:45.538 --> 06:48.735
PIease, God, don't let it be
kung pao chicken.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.841
You watched the show.
What did you think?

06:52.044 --> 06:54.672
I think you need to come out
of your shell.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.177
What is this dive?

06:59.519 --> 07:01.783
Only you could've picked this place.

07:02.488 --> 07:05.582
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

07:06.058 --> 07:09.789
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?

07:10.897 --> 07:15.925
Well, you know what they say:
Be careful what you wish for.

07:18.237 --> 07:21.070
-I think we're ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.265
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.636
There you go. Ross?

07:25.244 --> 07:27.735
I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.574
Hi. Sorry we're late.

07:29.816 --> 07:33.308
We kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.488
But a man can change.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.856
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

07:56.542 --> 07:59.409
Well, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

07:59.612 --> 08:02.740
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've written.

08:03.015 --> 08:07.076
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
I wanted to become a writer.

08:07.286 --> 08:10.016
Oh, please.
If I can do it, anybody can.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.617
Start with half a dozen
European cities...

08:12.825 --> 08:15.521
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia...

08:15.761 --> 08:18.161
...and you've got yourself a book.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.024
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.972
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.603
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.019
What is with you tonight?

08:47.226 --> 08:49.888
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.062
Okay, thank you.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.964
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

08:58.304 --> 09:00.738
No. It's the one he's licking.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.671
She's supposed to be with you.

09:04.577 --> 09:05.703
You're good.

09:06.746 --> 09:11.547
I have sold 100 million copies
of my books, and you know why?

09:11.984 --> 09:14.976
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

09:16.923 --> 09:21.860
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.059
I cannot sell a Paolo.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.493
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.863
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

09:31.103 --> 09:34.368
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

09:35.675 --> 09:36.937
When?

09:39.111 --> 09:41.409
He's not a hero.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.843
You know who our hero is?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.610
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

09:47.353 --> 09:48.752
No, it's you.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.454
-Please.
-No, really.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.089
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.454
-Right.
-Yes, you are.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.256
The fact that you don't think you are
makes you sexier.

09:59.465 --> 10:03.458
Come on, kiddo.
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.013
I'll just pee in the street.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.289
Is Chandler here?

10:35.868 --> 10:37.165
Wait. Come here.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.970
Okay, about last night...

10:41.207 --> 10:42.071
...you know...

10:42.308 --> 10:44.242
... Chandler, you didn't tell....

10:44.543 --> 10:48.877
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

10:49.148 --> 10:50.979
Right. No big deal.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.878
In bizarro world.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.516
You broke the code.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.658
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

11:00.893 --> 11:04.454
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.098
But not a mom. Never a mom.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.926
What are you guys doing out here?

11:12.138 --> 11:15.733
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.270
But apparently somebody overslept.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.116
Well, you don't have your racquet.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.012
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

11:27.319 --> 11:29.446
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.659
Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.862
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.334
I'm scum. I'm scum.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.036
-How could you let this happen?
-I don't know.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.170
It's not like she's a regular mom.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.204
She's sexy. She's....

11:50.443 --> 11:52.707
You don't think my mom's sexy?

11:54.013 --> 11:56.573
Well, not in the same way.

11:56.849 --> 12:00.808
I'll have you know, Gloria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.624
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.554
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.229
What are you doing here?

12:15.801 --> 12:17.598
Not playing racquetball.

12:19.772 --> 12:23.936
-He forgot to leave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.446
Sounds like you two have issues.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.710
Goodbye, baby.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.453
Do they wait for me to do this?

12:43.496 --> 12:46.624
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?

12:46.899 --> 12:49.265
If you don't, his mother might.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.002
What are you guys doing here?

12:53.472 --> 12:55.838
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.472
What did I ask?

13:17.863 --> 13:19.490
What are you doing here?

13:19.698 --> 13:22.826
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after...

13:23.102 --> 13:24.330
...that I, you know.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.368
So, what are you doing here?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.270
I'm not really here.

13:29.508 --> 13:34.002
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.281
Do you come here a lot...

13:40.119 --> 13:41.279
...without me?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.647
No, no, no.

13:46.959 --> 13:50.326
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

13:51.864 --> 13:54.355
How would I know? I wasn't here.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.966
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

14:02.107 --> 14:03.096
Oh, my God.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.072
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.005
I can't believe it.

14:09.081 --> 14:10.378
Paolo kissed my mom?

14:11.784 --> 14:14.912
I don't know if you noticed,
but he drank a lot.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.781
I mean, you know how he gets

14:19.625 --> 14:21.593
I can't do this. I did it.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.228
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

14:24.763 --> 14:25.730
What?

14:26.265 --> 14:31.066
I was upset about Rachel and
I had too much tequila, and Nora...

14:31.270 --> 14:33.101
... Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

14:35.040 --> 14:37.372
... being nice.
But nothing happened.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.736
Nothing. Ask Joey.

14:39.111 --> 14:42.046
-Joey came in
-You knew about this?

14:42.281 --> 14:45.011
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.217
Why didn't you tell me?

14:48.454 --> 14:52.220
You're lucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?

14:52.458 --> 14:53.891
Thanks, man. Big help.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.720
What the hell were you thinking?

14:56.996 --> 14:58.987
I wasn't. I don't know. I

14:59.198 --> 15:02.565
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.998
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.501
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you too.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.502
-Why are you mad at me?
-Let me slam the door.

15:11.677 --> 15:15.841
I didn't kiss her. See what happens
when you break the code?

15:29.261 --> 15:32.287
"A Woman Undone,
by Rachel Karen Greene. "

15:32.498 --> 15:35.865
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

15:36.101 --> 15:41.038
Do you think his "love stick" can be
"liberated from its denim prison"?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.936
Yeah, I'd say so.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.508
And there's no "J" in "engorged."

15:53.953 --> 15:56.547
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

15:56.989 --> 15:58.320
No. You?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.985
You just asked me.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.186
Maybe it was a trick question.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.364
Rachel, can we do this now?

16:11.170 --> 16:13.138
I am so hot.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.733
Here's my mom and dad
on their wedding day.

16:18.010 --> 16:21.002
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

16:22.414 --> 16:28.410
-I can't believe this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.

16:29.188 --> 16:33.852
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

16:34.927 --> 16:35.825
Thanks.

16:38.197 --> 16:42.930
I'd Iike to start with a song
about a man I recently met...

16:43.135 --> 16:45.968
...who's come to be
very important to me.

16:51.310 --> 16:55.007
You don't have to be awake
To be my man

16:57.282 --> 17:02.185
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

17:03.689 --> 17:05.850
Though we just met the other day

17:06.125 --> 17:09.561
There's something I have got to say

17:10.696 --> 17:13.665
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

17:16.135 --> 17:19.627
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.535
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started

17:23.809 --> 17:28.075
I was talking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?

17:32.818 --> 17:34.342
"Mother-kisser."

17:35.888 --> 17:37.048
I'll shut up.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.823
I know you're still mad at me...

17:40.092 --> 17:42.856
... but there were two people
there that night.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.398
-There were two sets of lips.
-I expect this from her.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.367
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.696
Then why don't you say something?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.897
Because it's complicated.
It's complex.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.608
You kissed my mom.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.674
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.913
That's funny.
Are we done now?

18:07.119 --> 18:10.384
You mean you're not gonna
tell her how you feel?

18:10.589 --> 18:13.786
Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom...

18:14.026 --> 18:17.189
...doesn't mean you know her.
You can't talk to her.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.727
Okay. "You can't"?
Or you can't?

18:21.066 --> 18:22.533
Okay, that's my finger.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.259
Okay, that's my knee.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.038
Still doing the play.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.139
What did you do with him?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.284
-You're awake.
-Look at you.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.489
How do you feel?

18:45.724 --> 18:47.783
A little woozy, but basically okay.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.893
Gosh, you look good.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.494
I feel good.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.231
Who are you?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.092
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.826
I' m Monica.
I've been caring for you.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.003
We both have.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.364
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-Actually, me.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.304
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.876
-I read to you.
-I sang.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.448
Well, thanks.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.981
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You' re welcome.

19:15.187 --> 19:18.088
So I guess I'll see you around.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.087
What? That's it?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.254
"See you around "?

19:23.529 --> 19:26.589
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.129
Maybe...

19:28.367 --> 19:29.698
... "That was nice. "

19:29.935 --> 19:31.300
" It meant something to me. "

19:32.538 --> 19:34.005
" I'll call you. "

19:35.140 --> 19:38.598
-Okay. I'll call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.678
This is so typical.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.811
You know, we give and we give...

19:47.052 --> 19:48.644
...and we give.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.981
And we just get nothing back.

19:51.223 --> 19:55.125
And then one day, you wake up,
and it's, "See you around. "

19:57.362 --> 19:58.795
Let's go, Phoebe.

20:00.799 --> 20:04.235
You know what?
We thought you were different.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.631
But I guess it was just the coma.

20:17.015 --> 20:21.008
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.951
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.024
Here's the kiss,
here's the goodbye....

20:28.460 --> 20:32.863
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.663
All right. Well, be good.
I love you.

20:39.805 --> 20:42.239
You kissed my best Ross.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.768
Or something to that effect.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.852
Look, it was stupid.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.248
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.991
I don't even know how it happened.

21:02.327 --> 21:06.991
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.996
Really, really stupid.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.635
Really, really stupid.

21:12.804 --> 21:15.238
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.

21:15.641 --> 21:16.835
No.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.277
The forbidden love
of a man and his door.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.384
He told her off. And not just
about the kiss.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.647
You're kidding?

21:31.857 --> 21:35.293
He said, "When are you gonna
start being a mom? "

21:35.494 --> 21:36.654
Then she said:

21:36.895 --> 21:41.298
"The question is, when are you gonna
realize I have a bomb? "

21:43.402 --> 21:45.267
Are you sure she didn't say:

21:45.470 --> 21:50.271
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom? "

21:52.644 --> 21:55.408
-That makes more sense.
-You think?

21:56.948 --> 21:58.347
What's going on now?

21:58.850 --> 22:02.786
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.220
I don't hear anything. Wait.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.480
What do you see?

22:07.759 --> 22:10.159
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.726
Wait, wait, wait.

22:11.930 --> 22:15.058
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.103
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run!

22:21.606 --> 22:24.097
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I' m okay.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.139
All right. You be good.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.003
Drive safe.

22:29.981 --> 22:32.279
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

22:41.059 --> 22:42.617
You mean that?

22:43.328 --> 22:44.693
Yeah, why not?

22:47.065 --> 22:49.124
So I told her.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.401
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.330
Couldn't have gone worse.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.171
-Well, how do you feel?
-Pretty good.

22:59.244 --> 23:00.575
I told her.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.743
Well, see?

23:02.981 --> 23:07.281
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom, huh?

23:07.486 --> 23:10.751
But we don't have to
go down that road.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.720
This is just the first chapter...

23:18.997 --> 23:23.559
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

23:24.236 --> 23:28.297
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

23:29.841 --> 23:31.832
She could have heaving beasts.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.503
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.340
What's a "niffle"?

23:37.549 --> 23:40.484
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.817
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

23:45.056 --> 23:49.049
Did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

23:49.661 --> 23:53.620
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.425
That's it. Give them back.

23:57.035 --> 24:01.836
Wait, I just got to the part
about her "public hair. "
