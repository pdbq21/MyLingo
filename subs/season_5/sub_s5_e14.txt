WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:06.998
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

00:10.643 --> 00:13.373
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

00:13.646 --> 00:17.480
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes."

00:18.752 --> 00:21.084
I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

00:21.388 --> 00:24.551
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.917
If he's moving, maybe I should
try to get his place!

00:30.063 --> 00:32.725
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.058
We could do that telephone thing...

00:35.335 --> 00:37.895
...where you have a can,
we have a can...

00:38.104 --> 00:40.334
...and it's connected by a string.

00:41.674 --> 00:44.905
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.516
He's got packing tape stuck
to where you really don't want it.

00:50.683 --> 00:53.880
Get it off, fat man! Get it off!

00:54.387 --> 00:56.912
Oh, no, he's trying to pull it off slowly.

00:57.090 --> 01:02.255
Take it from me, if you're gonna pull tape
off yourself, it's gotta be in one quick motion.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.158
Like that.

01:04.764 --> 01:06.925
The One Where Everyone Finds Out

01:51.177 --> 01:54.169
Oh, my God. I love this apartment!

01:54.414 --> 01:55.745
Isn't it perfect?

01:55.949 --> 01:59.578
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is!

01:59.853 --> 02:02.447
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.121
It's amazing!

02:05.358 --> 02:08.350
Hurry up with an application,
or I'll beat you to it.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.060
Well, I'm going to use
Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.875
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.308
Hey, you guys!

02:37.824 --> 02:39.416
Chandler and Monica!

02:40.493 --> 02:41.858
Oh, my God!

02:45.165 --> 02:46.154
Oh, my eyes!

02:46.399 --> 02:47.423
My eyes!

02:49.435 --> 02:50.493
It's okay!

02:50.737 --> 02:52.705
-They're doing it!
-I know!

02:52.906 --> 02:54.874
-I know!
-You know?

02:55.175 --> 02:59.009
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

02:59.512 --> 03:00.604
What's going on?

03:03.683 --> 03:05.048
-What?
-Nothing!

03:05.285 --> 03:08.254
We are so excited
that you'll get this apartment!

03:08.821 --> 03:09.810
Looks really good.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.887
Looks pretty good!

03:13.026 --> 03:14.050
Get in here!
Come on!

03:22.268 --> 03:24.668
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler...

03:24.871 --> 03:28.034
...were doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

03:28.274 --> 03:31.368
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

03:31.611 --> 03:33.943
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.743
I can't believe it!

03:37.016 --> 03:39.416
I think it's great. For him.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.176
She could do better.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.245
Hey, you guys.

03:44.524 --> 03:45.718
Come here!

03:46.092 --> 03:48.253
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.029
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

03:53.366 --> 03:54.799
Joey, she knows.

03:55.034 --> 03:58.128
We saw them doing it
through the window.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.271
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.069
We saw them fornicating.

04:08.715 --> 04:12.116
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?

04:12.318 --> 04:15.378
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.085
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

04:19.325 --> 04:22.294
All the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.292
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.493
What do you mean?

04:29.736 --> 04:33.638
If they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.500
I would enjoy that.

04:38.144 --> 04:41.238
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.282
-That doesn't sound like fun.
-So we'll make it fun.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.477
We'll do it like a barbershop quartet!

04:48.655 --> 04:51.749
We know, we know, we know

04:54.427 --> 04:56.395
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.585
I can't take

04:57.764 --> 05:01.359
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.330
I can't take anymore secrets.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.766
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.439
You don't have any secrets.

05:11.611 --> 05:15.240
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.089
How are we going to mess with them?

05:24.524 --> 05:27.015
You could use your position
as the roommate.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.855
And I would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.791
My sexuality.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.527
Hello, children.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.133
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.377
That jacket looks great on you.

05:47.213 --> 05:49.408
-Really?
-The material is so soft.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.412
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.045
You're working out?

05:55.321 --> 05:57.312
I try to squeeze things.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.129
Are you okay?

06:05.331 --> 06:07.492
If you really want to know

06:07.734 --> 06:09.258
I can't tell you this.

06:10.236 --> 06:11.965
You can tell me anything.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.334
Actually, you are the one person
I can't tell this to.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.168
And the one person I want to the most.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.073
What's going on?

06:23.349 --> 06:26.512
I just haven't been
with a guy in so long...

06:26.819 --> 06:29.344
...and sometimes you're
looking for something...

06:29.622 --> 06:33.285
...and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee....

06:33.526 --> 06:35.824
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

06:38.331 --> 06:41.494
Just something to think about.
I know I will.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.442
You are so cute.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.348
How did you get to be so cute?

06:59.619 --> 07:01.849
My grandfather was Swedish.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.682
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.722
Now you're even cuter.

07:09.862 --> 07:14.128
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.995
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.794
Phoebe was hitting on me.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.733
What are you talking about?

07:22.008 --> 07:23.999
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

07:27.814 --> 07:28.803
It's not possible.

07:33.252 --> 07:36.688
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

07:36.889 --> 07:38.982
...in a sexless kind of way.

07:39.258 --> 07:42.091
You know, I can't hear that enough.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.659
I just think you misunderstood her.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.492
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.

07:48.768 --> 07:51.032
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

07:51.737 --> 07:52.726
This bicep?

07:53.239 --> 07:55.901
Well, it's not flexed right now.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.714
Why is it so hard for you to believe
that Phoebe could be attracted to me?

08:02.882 --> 08:04.440
It's not.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.450
All the girls are attracted to you.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.815
You're part bunny.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.386
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

08:18.631 --> 08:21.464
Actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.535
Want to do it with me?

08:25.738 --> 08:27.729
Sure, I'll do it with you.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.373
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.477
Here you go.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.708
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.544
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.587
I have quarters!

08:49.929 --> 08:52.921
Great. Now we can do laundry all night.
All night laundry!

08:56.002 --> 08:58.197
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

08:58.437 --> 09:01.998
I called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.072
He's already had 100 applicants.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.211
-Oh, man.
-No, no, it's okay.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.940
Because you know what the difference
between them and me is?

09:10.116 --> 09:12.175
Your history of bedwetting?

09:12.952 --> 09:15.386
Hey, I trusted you, man!

09:17.089 --> 09:19.148
Anyway, the difference is...

09:19.325 --> 09:20.690
...I've got the edge.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.589
It's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

09:23.896 --> 09:26.387
...to tip the scales in my direction.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.190
You can see it from the window.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.669
Is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

09:36.609 --> 09:38.406
That new mountain bike?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.843
What did you send?

09:43.115 --> 09:45.879
A basket of mini muffins.

09:47.019 --> 09:51.353
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?

09:51.557 --> 09:53.616
The small one.

09:54.360 --> 09:59.229
You actually thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

09:59.465 --> 10:04.198
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.030
It was the best day.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.467
Your work makes me sad.

10:09.976 --> 10:13.036
Oh, man, I want that place so much!

10:13.245 --> 10:15.941
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.275
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.586
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

10:23.422 --> 10:24.912
Bye.

10:25.257 --> 10:28.090
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.132
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

10:36.402 --> 10:37.494
Actually, I did.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.228
So do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

10:42.274 --> 10:45.266
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

10:45.478 --> 10:46.467
Are you serious?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.012
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

10:49.615 --> 10:51.606
That's the only explanation!

10:54.987 --> 10:59.253
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

10:59.825 --> 11:00.951
She knows!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.029
Phoebe knows about us.

11:14.907 --> 11:15.999
I didn't tell them!

11:16.442 --> 11:17.534
Them?

11:17.743 --> 11:19.108
Who's "them"?

11:20.446 --> 11:22.846
Phoebe and Joey.

11:26.552 --> 11:27.541
And Rachel.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.351
I would have told you,
but I promised not to tell.

11:31.590 --> 11:32.579
I'm sorry.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.385
But it's over now, right?

11:34.627 --> 11:39.087
You can tell them you know they know,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!

11:40.700 --> 11:42.065
Unless

11:42.301 --> 11:44.701
Not "unless"!
This must end now!

11:45.104 --> 11:48.596
They think they are so slick
messing with us.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.936
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.368
So

11:54.580 --> 11:58.414
The messers become the messees!

12:00.386 --> 12:03.446
Come on, you guys.
Think how much fun it would be to tell.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.455
We know, we know, we know

12:09.095 --> 12:10.426
What?

12:11.764 --> 12:13.527
Oh, that wasn't you.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.338
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.564
Why don't you find another apartment?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.673
I've already looked
at 1000 apartments this month.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.243
None of them even compares
to that one.

12:28.414 --> 12:33.010
Well, except for one, but I would have had
to share it with an Armenian family.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.676
Grandma really liked me.

12:36.055 --> 12:39.422
But I want Ugly Naked apartment!

12:40.192 --> 12:41.454
You know what?

12:41.694 --> 12:45.824
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.965
Like if I wanted something from Joey...

12:48.200 --> 12:52.364
...I would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches...

12:54.740 --> 12:56.435
...or my underwear.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.808
I'm listening.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.280
That is a great idea!

13:04.483 --> 13:09.079
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.451
So that gives me back my edge!

13:12.958 --> 13:15.722
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.

13:15.895 --> 13:16.884
He broke that.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.724
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.125
So he likes to break stuff.

13:26.605 --> 13:30.564
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.607
Didn't he used to have a cat?

13:32.845 --> 13:35.575
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would bum him out.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.613
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.821
Hold on a second,
she's right here.

13:46.992 --> 13:47.981
It's Chandler.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.097
Hello, you.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.632
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you all day.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.605
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.169
Really?

14:05.377 --> 14:07.038
Joey won't be here tonight.

14:07.279 --> 14:11.010
Why don't you come over?
I'll let you feel my bicep.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.308
Or maybe more.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.119
I'll have to get back to you on that.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.828
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

14:24.897 --> 14:26.023
Are you kidding?

14:26.232 --> 14:28.723
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon

14:37.543 --> 14:40.341
Joey? Do they know that we know?

14:43.182 --> 14:44.012
They know you know.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.740
I knew it!

14:47.620 --> 14:50.851
I would say, "Thank God!
Everybody knows! It's finally over!"

14:51.023 --> 14:53.753
But that hasn't been working for me.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.326
I cannot believe those two!

14:56.495 --> 15:00.295
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

15:02.568 --> 15:05.662
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.306
Joey, you can't say anything.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.404
Couldn't if I wanted to.

15:18.384 --> 15:23.287
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.

15:23.489 --> 15:27.550
I realize that the competition
is fierce but....

15:29.194 --> 15:33.824
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.228
I applaud you.

15:39.505 --> 15:42.372
Man, I wish I was naked.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.044
I mean, this looks so great.

15:46.412 --> 15:49.040
That is how God intended it.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.345
Look. They're panicked!

15:53.519 --> 15:54.918
They'll totally back down.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.655
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

15:59.925 --> 16:01.483
I'm going to go in.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.159
Be sexy.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.721
Please.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.506
I'd love to come by tonight.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.404
Really?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.743
Absolutely.
Say, around 7?

16:31.223 --> 16:35.216
I'm really looking forward to you
and me having sexual intercourse.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.733
Hey, check it out!

16:42.935 --> 16:44.766
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

16:53.879 --> 16:57.212
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

16:57.983 --> 17:00.076
It's Naked Ross!

17:03.856 --> 17:06.324
Would you like another mini muffin?

17:06.492 --> 17:09.393
Try the blueberry, they're delicious.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.396
Showtime!

17:18.937 --> 17:20.427
Rachel, get me perfume.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.573
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

17:31.984 --> 17:36.921
All right, thanks, but glasses that do not
have handles and that are glass.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.023
And wine that is not olive oil.

17:41.627 --> 17:45.859
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it will freak her out.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.964
How far am I gonna have to go with her?

17:50.202 --> 17:52.170
She'll give in way before you do.

17:52.337 --> 17:53.326
How do you know?

17:53.539 --> 17:56.838
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.178
At this?

18:00.712 --> 18:03.237
Just go get some! Go!

18:05.317 --> 18:08.013
Now, I'm going to try to listen
from right here.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.482
Oh, wait.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.417
Good idea.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.852
Don't give away the farm.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.925
Come on in.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.530
I was going to.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.874
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

18:33.078 --> 18:34.340
Sure.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.854
So here we are.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.215
Nervous?

18:45.424 --> 18:46.914
Me? No. You?

18:47.726 --> 18:49.091
I want this to happen.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.387
So do l.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.436
I'm going to put on some music.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.352
Joey likes to scare the duck.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.788
Maybe I'll dance for you.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.805
You look good.

19:45.417 --> 19:46.782
Thanks.

19:47.419 --> 19:51.287
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me...

19:51.590 --> 19:55.287
...want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.096
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

19:59.264 --> 20:00.253
Really?

20:00.465 --> 20:02.456
Do you not want to?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.331
First I want to take off
all my clothes...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.804
...and have you rub lotion on me.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.607
That would be nice.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.381
I'll go get the lotion.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.481
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!

20:25.691 --> 20:28.387
-She's bluffing!
-She's not backing down.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.288
She went like this

20:32.564 --> 20:35.397
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.794
It's Chandler. You can take him.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.428
Come on. Don't you remember when
you made him cry using only your words?

20:44.876 --> 20:46.867
Aren't you guys done yet?

20:47.112 --> 20:49.273
I want to sit in my chair!

20:50.215 --> 20:54.709
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.851
I like that.

20:58.123 --> 21:01.923
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.926
You didn't rip off any buttons.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.627
It's not my first time.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.942
Go back there and seduce her
till she cracks!

21:19.144 --> 21:20.611
Give me a second.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.381
-Did you clean up in here?
-Of course!

21:30.289 --> 21:31.551
You're going?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.948
Not without you, lover.

21:39.064 --> 21:42.261
So this is my bra.

21:45.837 --> 21:48.169
It's very, very nice.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.303
Well, come here.

21:52.844 --> 21:55.506
I'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.

21:57.182 --> 22:00.583
You should be.
I'm very bendy.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.621
I'll kiss you now.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.689
Not if I kiss you first.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.881
I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.479
Here it comes.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.211
Our first kiss.

22:47.666 --> 22:48.690
You win!

22:49.935 --> 22:50.924
I can't have sex with you!

22:51.103 --> 22:53.128
-And why not?
-I'm in love with Monica!

22:53.372 --> 22:54.737
You're what?

22:57.075 --> 22:58.064
Love her!

22:58.477 --> 22:59.705
I love her!

22:59.911 --> 23:02.436
I love her!

23:06.885 --> 23:08.716
I love you, Monica.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.612
I love you too, Chandler.

23:17.329 --> 23:20.662
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!

23:23.568 --> 23:25.229
Dude!

23:26.738 --> 23:29.229
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.440
May I say your breasts are still showing.

23:33.612 --> 23:34.772
God.

23:35.981 --> 23:37.539
All right!
So that's it?

23:37.783 --> 23:39.478
It's over.
Everybody knows!

23:39.718 --> 23:41.276
Actually, Ross doesn't.

23:41.486 --> 23:43.954
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.755
Well, here it is.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.957
A new place for a new Ross.

23:56.234 --> 24:00.000
I'll have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

24:00.238 --> 24:02.331
It's nice to see you
back on your feet.

24:02.607 --> 24:06.566
I am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.940
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

24:10.148 --> 24:11.513
That would be great.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.116
I am totally ready
to come back to work.

24:21.159 --> 24:23.252
What are you doing?

24:24.262 --> 24:27.197
Get off my sister!
