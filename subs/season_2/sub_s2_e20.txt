WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:10.674
-What you guys doing?
-Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

00:12.847 --> 00:16.510
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.143
-What?
-What are you talking about?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.651
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.447
Frontier fun!

00:25.359 --> 00:27.122
Pheebs, what about the end?

00:27.328 --> 00:30.525
When Yeller saves the family
and everyone's happy?

00:30.731 --> 00:31.823
That's not the end.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.969
That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

00:37.571 --> 00:39.402
What about when he has rabies?

00:39.807 --> 00:42.002
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.636
That's what my mom said.

00:46.981 --> 00:50.417
I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.047
Why? What's about to happen?

00:53.254 --> 00:55.017
I've never seen this part.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.324
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

01:00.928 --> 01:01.986
Oh, no.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.494
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.423
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.100
No! The end! The end!

01:12.706 --> 01:15.869
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

01:17.912 --> 01:20.005
The One Where Old Yeller Dies

02:04.692 --> 02:09.152
Have you guys eaten? Richard and l
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.458
Chicken and potatoes.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.367
What am I wearing?

02:15.370 --> 02:17.463
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.003
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

02:28.003 --> 02:30.116
That teach me a lesson.

02:32.116 --> 02:33.879
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.546
How do you find clothes that fit?

02:38.289 --> 02:40.348
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

02:40.624 --> 02:43.957
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

02:44.228 --> 02:45.627
And no, I don't look.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.827
No, not that one.

02:48.132 --> 02:50.965
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Nicks game.

02:51.201 --> 02:55.729
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

02:56.373 --> 02:59.171
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

02:59.877 --> 03:02.471
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

03:05.716 --> 03:07.581
Why don't you ask Richard?

03:08.819 --> 03:12.050
Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Nicks game...

03:14.725 --> 03:17.717
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

03:17.928 --> 03:21.694
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

03:23.267 --> 03:25.098
Being a huge Nicks fan myself...

03:25.369 --> 03:29.328
... I think you should take someone
who's a huge Nicks fan.

03:31.442 --> 03:33.034
That's Eric.

03:34.278 --> 03:36.439
Glad to be of help.
Matches.

03:37.915 --> 03:40.941
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

03:41.885 --> 03:43.045
What?

03:44.521 --> 03:46.512
-I don't know.
-Come on!

03:46.790 --> 03:51.090
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

03:51.428 --> 03:54.955
Richard's really nice.
We just don't know him really well.

03:55.199 --> 03:56.894
Plus, he's old

03:59.203 --> 04:01.603
er than some people.

04:02.139 --> 04:04.699
But younger than some buildings.

04:06.977 --> 04:09.309
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

04:09.613 --> 04:11.080
He's important to me.

04:11.281 --> 04:14.250
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

04:19.056 --> 04:20.216
How do we say yes...

04:20.457 --> 04:23.915
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

04:25.229 --> 04:27.254
Okay, this could be tough.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.561
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

04:35.973 --> 04:37.941
You almost had it.

04:44.314 --> 04:46.441
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

04:48.786 --> 04:50.447
Hi, honey.

04:50.654 --> 04:53.122
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

04:53.323 --> 04:56.486
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

04:56.694 --> 04:58.685
...and he pulls himself up!

05:00.197 --> 05:02.290
He pulled himself up!

05:02.499 --> 05:03.989
Standing man!

05:05.202 --> 05:08.933
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

05:09.807 --> 05:12.002
We know. He already did it last week.

05:12.309 --> 05:14.300
You can watch our tape if you want.

05:14.511 --> 05:18.948
See, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

05:19.183 --> 05:22.346
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

05:22.619 --> 05:24.883
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

05:25.155 --> 05:27.680
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

05:27.891 --> 05:30.451
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

05:30.694 --> 05:33.959
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen."

05:34.198 --> 05:37.998
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

05:38.302 --> 05:41.738
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

05:42.005 --> 05:42.972
Listen. I feel

05:43.207 --> 05:44.674
That would be great.

05:47.544 --> 05:50.240
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.573
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

05:55.419 --> 05:57.011
Did you just see that?

05:57.221 --> 05:59.746
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

05:59.990 --> 06:02.288
He's never waved before!

06:02.493 --> 06:04.723
Yes, he has. Very good.

06:08.332 --> 06:09.890
What you got there?

06:10.167 --> 06:14.035
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

06:15.172 --> 06:19.700
All you need now is The Killing Fields
and guacamole, and you got a party!

06:21.044 --> 06:24.036
I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

06:24.281 --> 06:28.047
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

06:28.352 --> 06:30.946
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

06:31.221 --> 06:33.746
You know, before she killed herself.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.858
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

06:40.397 --> 06:43.059
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

06:44.868 --> 06:47.029
What's the matter?
He's parking the car.

06:47.638 --> 06:51.574
-Did you guys have fun?
-Your boyfriend is so cool.

06:51.809 --> 06:55.905
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

06:57.748 --> 06:59.215
He must like you best.

06:59.917 --> 07:03.114
What about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

07:03.320 --> 07:05.311
You never even saw the money.

07:05.556 --> 07:08.889
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

07:09.293 --> 07:12.421
You're welcome. Hey, Joey,
thanks for parking the car.

07:12.629 --> 07:14.324
No problem.

07:15.599 --> 07:17.794
-Hey, Chandler
-I think they get it.

07:20.470 --> 07:21.630
There's the man!

07:23.774 --> 07:25.503
Hey, you're getting better.

07:26.276 --> 07:27.743
I'm gonna keep this.

07:29.980 --> 07:30.912
He kept my dollar.

07:37.321 --> 07:39.789
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

07:39.990 --> 07:41.855
We're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

07:42.092 --> 07:46.620
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.993
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.769
Look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

07:54.538 --> 07:56.870
-We love you.
-Bye, Mommy.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.937
Have a good time.

08:02.679 --> 08:03.543
Look.

08:10.687 --> 08:13.281
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

08:14.858 --> 08:17.383
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

08:17.628 --> 08:20.529
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

08:22.799 --> 08:25.290
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

08:25.502 --> 08:27.333
Not like him, per se.

08:27.537 --> 08:29.664
Just not unlike him.

08:40.217 --> 08:42.412
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

08:44.021 --> 08:46.683
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

08:47.057 --> 08:48.752
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

08:49.059 --> 08:50.083
We flipped for it.

08:50.394 --> 08:52.919
I got the cigar,he got the mustache.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.255
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

08:57.234 --> 08:59.828
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

09:00.537 --> 09:03.097
I promised Richard
we'd meet him downstairs.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.398
You're meeting Richard?

09:04.608 --> 09:06.235
-Ranger game.
-Didn't he tell you?

09:06.576 --> 09:09.773
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.206
You hear that?

09:11.448 --> 09:13.211
We're the guys!

09:14.685 --> 09:17.176
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

09:17.387 --> 09:18.615
Thank you!

09:27.698 --> 09:29.632
Hi. We're visiting.

09:30.367 --> 09:33.393
It's Ben and his dada.

09:36.239 --> 09:38.230
Can you say "dada"?

09:38.775 --> 09:41.903
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

09:42.112 --> 09:43.579
No luck, huh?

09:43.780 --> 09:46.146
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

09:46.450 --> 09:51.285
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but....

09:54.257 --> 09:58.023
Would you hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

09:58.228 --> 10:00.128
Sure. Okay.

10:05.902 --> 10:07.130
What are you doing?

10:07.337 --> 10:09.305
I'm holding Ben.

10:11.608 --> 10:13.166
He's a baby, not a bomb.

10:15.412 --> 10:17.175
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

10:17.848 --> 10:20.180
This is how I would hold a football.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.612
Here. Here. There we go.

10:22.853 --> 10:27.222
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

10:27.424 --> 10:29.517
I mean, you know, since I was one.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.422
-It's all right. No big deal.
-Really?

10:32.696 --> 10:35.597
I'm sure you'll feel different
when it's our baby.

10:35.832 --> 10:37.629
-What?
-What?

10:38.435 --> 10:40.300
You think about stuff like that?

10:41.171 --> 10:43.196
Yeah. I mean....

10:44.274 --> 10:47.835
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

10:49.312 --> 10:51.542
Two babies?

10:51.782 --> 10:53.841
You know, a boy and a girl.

10:54.117 --> 10:57.450
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

11:00.223 --> 11:01.986
Then what's gonna happen?

11:02.192 --> 11:06.219
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

11:08.231 --> 11:11.632
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

11:11.902 --> 11:14.234
... but close enough
that they can baby-sit.

11:14.471 --> 11:18.669
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

11:18.909 --> 11:20.900
... but the school system's great.

11:24.214 --> 11:26.478
Wow, that's great! Great!

11:27.317 --> 11:29.308
Okay, wow! You know what?

11:29.519 --> 11:31.419
I'm off my break now.

11:32.756 --> 11:34.314
Here. You take this.

11:36.827 --> 11:40.228
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

11:41.264 --> 11:43.232
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.867
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

11:46.103 --> 11:48.401
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

11:57.212 --> 11:58.975
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

11:59.214 --> 12:02.809
Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating
each other in the Andes.

12:02.809 --> 12:07.809
I was really just need a small talk.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.752
Ok, I was just fanting.

12:09.752 --> 12:11.481
So you watched the movies?

12:11.754 --> 12:14.245
What is happening to the world?

12:14.724 --> 12:17.659
I mean....
No, no, because E.T. Ieaves...

12:17.861 --> 12:20.557
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

12:20.897 --> 12:22.194
Charlotte who?

12:22.432 --> 12:23.865
With the web. The spider.

12:24.067 --> 12:26.092
She dies. She has babies and dies.

12:26.336 --> 12:29.396
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

12:31.174 --> 12:32.835
You wanna feel better?

12:35.512 --> 12:38.037
Here. Watch this.

12:38.281 --> 12:40.841
It's a Wonderful Life.
I've heard of this.

12:41.084 --> 12:43.678
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

12:43.887 --> 12:45.616
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

12:45.855 --> 12:48.255
I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

12:48.525 --> 12:50.516
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

12:50.727 --> 12:53.628
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

12:55.598 --> 12:59.864
The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

13:01.871 --> 13:04.635
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

13:05.508 --> 13:07.100
Hey, big guy. Game time.

13:07.410 --> 13:10.140
-Hey! Be right there!
-There's a game?

13:10.347 --> 13:13.612
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

13:14.751 --> 13:16.742
Bring your nerves of steel.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.023
It's the basketball playoffs.

13:21.258 --> 13:25.695
I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

13:25.929 --> 13:27.362
They have each other.

13:27.597 --> 13:29.792
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

13:30.033 --> 13:33.935
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

13:34.137 --> 13:38.164
They don't start sentences with
"You know who just died shoveling snow?"

13:39.476 --> 13:41.671
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

13:42.445 --> 13:43.878
Go Nicks!

13:44.114 --> 13:45.809
It's the college playoffs.

13:46.049 --> 13:48.449
-Then, go Vassar!
-They're not in it.

13:48.652 --> 13:50.483
Okay, then just go.

13:52.856 --> 13:54.687
Why does this bother me so much?

13:54.958 --> 13:59.622
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

13:59.829 --> 14:01.023
Sure.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.359
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

14:04.567 --> 14:08.526
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

14:12.676 --> 14:13.574
Me too!

14:13.810 --> 14:17.211
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys

14:17.414 --> 14:19.382
Ross made plans for the century.

14:19.716 --> 14:23.675
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

14:23.887 --> 14:28.654
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

14:31.695 --> 14:33.560
What happened back there?

14:33.830 --> 14:35.559
I don't know. You tell me.

14:35.765 --> 14:38.529
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

14:38.735 --> 14:41.704
... I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

14:41.938 --> 14:44.532
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

14:44.774 --> 14:48.403
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

14:48.611 --> 14:52.274
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

14:52.515 --> 14:54.506
You never think about our future?

14:54.751 --> 14:57.777
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

14:58.021 --> 15:00.012
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

15:00.223 --> 15:02.748
I do not think about
our children's names!

15:04.127 --> 15:06.755
You know what our
children's names will be?

15:07.797 --> 15:12.234
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

15:12.435 --> 15:14.630
And I thought that might be good.

15:16.606 --> 15:17.470
What book?

15:18.808 --> 15:20.639
The Big Book of Children's Names.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.439
Okay, listen.

15:24.714 --> 15:26.147
What we have is amazing.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.113
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

15:29.319 --> 15:30.980
I spent my whole life like that.

15:31.254 --> 15:33.779
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.958
I like not knowing right now.

15:36.292 --> 15:40.228
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

15:40.430 --> 15:42.125
-Okay, fine!
-Thank you!

15:42.332 --> 15:44.800
-We're not done!
-I didn't know that.

15:45.268 --> 15:49.295
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

15:49.506 --> 15:51.337
He knows we'll end up together.

15:51.608 --> 15:54.668
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

15:54.911 --> 15:56.845
-I will!
-Good, because I love you!

15:57.113 --> 15:58.637
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

15:58.848 --> 16:01.078
-That's the first time we've said that!
-Yes, it is!

16:01.284 --> 16:03.775
-I'm gonna kiss you!
-You better!

16:11.694 --> 16:13.252
Thanks for the great movie tip.

16:13.463 --> 16:15.328
-Did you like it?
-Oh, yeah.

16:15.532 --> 16:19.024
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

16:19.302 --> 16:23.204
...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

16:25.108 --> 16:27.872
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

16:28.311 --> 16:30.279
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

16:30.513 --> 16:32.777
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

16:33.016 --> 16:37.316
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

16:40.056 --> 16:41.489
IKick, save! And...

16:41.724 --> 16:42.986
...denied!

16:43.726 --> 16:47.059
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up....

16:47.964 --> 16:48.828
Yes!

16:49.032 --> 16:52.126
Could that shot be any prettier?

16:52.802 --> 16:54.360
Man, you are incredible.

16:54.571 --> 16:56.334
We had a table in college.

16:56.539 --> 16:59.804
Really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

17:00.543 --> 17:04.639
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

17:08.751 --> 17:12.414
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

17:12.655 --> 17:13.679
One more point.

17:16.759 --> 17:17.987
Score!

17:19.562 --> 17:21.086
Now can we go?

17:21.731 --> 17:23.858
That's why we don't let her play.

17:26.169 --> 17:27.761
Is everything all right?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.600
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

17:32.842 --> 17:34.776
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

17:35.044 --> 17:37.103
He's just really great
to hang out with.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.507
-Well....
-No, seriously.

17:38.715 --> 17:42.276
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

17:45.255 --> 17:48.053
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just

17:48.258 --> 17:49.919
What are you kicking me for?

17:51.628 --> 17:53.926
I'm trying to talk here.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.266
You guys see me as a dad?

17:58.468 --> 18:00.402
-Oh, yeah!
-No!

18:04.140 --> 18:08.270
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.639
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

18:12.715 --> 18:14.410
We mean "pal."

18:14.617 --> 18:17.415
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

18:20.156 --> 18:21.987
Monica's my dad.

18:22.425 --> 18:25.258
I've even got some dads down at work.

18:25.828 --> 18:26.795
That's fine.

18:27.063 --> 18:31.227
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.492
I'll just see you kids around.

18:33.803 --> 18:35.065
Nighty-night.

18:35.271 --> 18:36.829
You're not a dad!

18:38.308 --> 18:40.572
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

18:54.616 --> 18:56.140
So are you okay?

18:58.186 --> 18:59.175
Just...

18:59.454 --> 19:01.922
... I feel like I'm about a hundred.

19:02.591 --> 19:05.253
I thought I was just one of the guys.

19:05.860 --> 19:07.020
Come here.

19:07.295 --> 19:09.923
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.862
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.774
I was killing them.

19:21.977 --> 19:24.207
Yeah, well they suck too.

19:27.482 --> 19:30.940
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

19:31.219 --> 19:35.315
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

19:39.527 --> 19:41.324
-It's us.
-Come on up.

19:41.529 --> 19:43.156
I'll get his stuff together.

19:43.465 --> 19:46.400
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

19:46.968 --> 19:48.401
Yes, we can.

19:48.670 --> 19:49.864
Yes, we can.

19:51.473 --> 19:53.873
There! I did it!

19:55.076 --> 19:56.338
I did it!

19:57.345 --> 19:59.245
Look at that!

19:59.714 --> 20:01.807
It stays on and everything.

20:08.857 --> 20:12.452
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

20:12.661 --> 20:15.494
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

20:15.730 --> 20:17.027
-What?
-Ben just said hi!

20:17.265 --> 20:18.698
What, the word "hi"?

20:18.900 --> 20:20.731
No, my Uncle Hi.

20:21.903 --> 20:24.701
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

20:24.939 --> 20:28.670
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.842
-Where is he?
-We missed you.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.572
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

20:35.784 --> 20:38.252
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.246
What did he say?

20:40.522 --> 20:42.012
Something about hi.

20:43.258 --> 20:46.887
That's so exciting!
Mommy's so proud of you!

20:49.130 --> 20:51.257
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

20:56.905 --> 20:58.600
This could go on for a while.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.798
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.771
Well, this was fun.

21:02.977 --> 21:06.435
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

21:07.482 --> 21:10.042
-All right, so I've got him...?
-Tuesday.

21:10.552 --> 21:11.382
Bye, you guys.

21:11.586 --> 21:13.577
-Take care.
-Bye, Ben.

21:17.492 --> 21:19.653
Did he just say "bye"?

21:19.894 --> 21:21.054
He said bye!

21:21.329 --> 21:23.297
You said bye!
He said bye to me!

21:23.565 --> 21:25.430
Yes, he did!

21:25.667 --> 21:28.227
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

21:29.404 --> 21:32.271
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

21:33.241 --> 21:34.469
See you later.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.253
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

21:55.497 --> 21:57.727
...isn't this a nice hole here?

21:58.600 --> 22:03.094
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

22:03.738 --> 22:08.675
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

22:09.944 --> 22:13.573
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

22:13.782 --> 22:15.875
But I think we can handle it.

22:16.184 --> 22:21.121
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so....

22:21.623 --> 22:22.783
Here we go.

22:23.024 --> 22:24.582
Bert? Bert?

22:26.428 --> 22:29.920
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.361
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.591
I'm so glad you're here.
