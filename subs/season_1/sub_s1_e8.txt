WEBVTT

00:06.639 --> 00:08.971
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

00:09.175 --> 00:12.508
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.680
Does it get better than this?

00:15.382 --> 00:17.441
Question: Are you dating anyone?

00:17.817 --> 00:20.650
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.282
Perfect might be a problem.

00:23.523 --> 00:27.015
Had you said codependent
or self-destructive....

00:27.727 --> 00:30.491
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.125
He is cute.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.527
-He's funny. He's
-He's a he?

00:35.735 --> 00:37.134
Well, yeah.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.995
Oh, God! I just

00:41.007 --> 00:42.406
You' re nice Oh, God.

00:42.742 --> 00:46.473
Good, Shelly. I' m gonna flush myself
down the toilet now.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.839
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.243
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

01:37.464 --> 01:41.366
It's hard to enjoy noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

01:41.668 --> 01:44.535
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

01:46.339 --> 01:47.601
Yeah.

01:49.642 --> 01:52.133
When I first met you,
I thought maybe...

01:52.412 --> 01:53.504
... possibly...

01:53.746 --> 01:54.804
...you might be.

01:55.915 --> 01:56.904
You did?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.746
You spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts...

02:00.954 --> 02:02.785
...so I figured maybe not.

02:04.224 --> 02:09.127
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

02:09.329 --> 02:11.126
-I did.
-I think so, yeah.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.327
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

02:16.102 --> 02:19.401
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.196
You' re kidding.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.734
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.571
I wanted to go out with her too.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.113
I told her you were seeing
Bernie Spellman...

02:33.653 --> 02:35.052
...who also liked her.

02:40.059 --> 02:41.924
Well, this is fascinating.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.424
So what is it about me?

02:45.198 --> 02:48.395
I don't know.
You' re smart, you' re funny....

02:48.668 --> 02:51.034
So is Ross.
Ever think that about him?

02:51.404 --> 02:53.895
-Yeah, right!
-What is it?

02:56.042 --> 02:59.170
I don't know. You just
You have a quality.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.039
-Yes, exactly.
-Yeah, a quality.

03:02.715 --> 03:06.776
"A quality. " Good. I was worried you
were gonna be vague about this.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.489
I think this is gonna work for you.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.851
-Excuse me?
-Sure, sure.

03:13.059 --> 03:18.019
Women find you less threatening,
they let their guards down...

03:18.231 --> 03:21.598
...you' re like a stealth heterosexual.

03:32.412 --> 03:37.179
-It's Paolo calling from Rome.
-Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

03:42.355 --> 03:45.290
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.450
Just gotta go to Rome.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.032
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

03:53.299 --> 03:54.823
I'm talking to Rome.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.329
I'm talking to Rome.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.995
Hey, Dad. What's up?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.235
Oh, God.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.311
Ross, it's Nana.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.752
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.587
So how is she doing?

04:25.331 --> 04:27.765
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

04:28.368 --> 04:31.132
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I' m fine, fine.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.532
I' m glad you' re here.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.709
-What's with your hair?
-What?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.639
-What's different?
-Nothing.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.273
Oh, maybe that's it.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.144
-She's unbelievable. Her mother's
-Okay, relax.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.617
We' re gonna be here a while.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.019
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.523
Oh, God!

05:01.334 --> 05:04.770
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.765
Yeah, they were gross.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.405
You know what I love?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.475
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.842
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.141
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

05:19.919 --> 05:20.908
Mrs. Geller?

05:26.626 --> 05:27.991
She looks so small.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.452
I know.

05:30.563 --> 05:34.021
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phylis now.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.030
Aunt Phylis is dead?

05:36.235 --> 05:38.362
Yeah, for like six years.

05:38.671 --> 05:43.108
Where were?
Can we focus, please?

05:52.752 --> 05:54.276
Goodbye, Nana.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.161
Bye, Nana.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.360
Nurse!

06:11.871 --> 06:13.202
What is going on?

06:13.973 --> 06:16.703
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.567
Well, she's not quite.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.102
What?

06:21.314 --> 06:25.011
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

06:25.418 --> 06:26.510
What's going on?

06:26.786 --> 06:28.413
She may have died.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.552
She may have died?

06:30.857 --> 06:32.518
We're looking into it.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.583
I'll go see.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.360
This almost never happens.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.910
Now she's passed.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.924
I just have to know, okay?

07:12.498 --> 07:13.795
Is it my hair?

07:14.333 --> 07:17.393
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.798
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.008
So did she...?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.911
Twice.

07:31.350 --> 07:33.750
-Twice?
-Oh, that sucks.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.118
-You guys okay?
-I don't know. It's weird.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.917
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel....

07:43.262 --> 07:45.127
Maybe she's not really gone.

07:45.331 --> 07:46.889
No, no, she's gone.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.098
We checked.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.560
A lot.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.805
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.941
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then...

07:58.177 --> 08:02.011
... I get this feeling that she's
right here, you know?

08:06.052 --> 08:08.577
And Debbie, my friend
from junior high...

08:08.821 --> 08:12.257
...got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.692
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe...

08:15.962 --> 08:18.396
...when I use a little yellow pencil.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.732
-I miss her.
-Here, Pheebs.

08:27.006 --> 08:27.995
Want this?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.300
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.738
I just sharpened her this morning.

08:35.081 --> 08:38.141
I don't believe any of that.
When you' re dead...

08:38.351 --> 08:41.514
...you' re dead. You' re gone.
You' re worm food.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.022
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

08:51.130 --> 08:54.099
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.140
Dad, let's just make a decision.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.243
You're right.
It's going into the ground.

09:06.445 --> 09:09.039
We should get the most basic thing.

09:09.248 --> 09:14.242
"The non-protective corrugated
fiberboard with white laminate. "

09:14.787 --> 09:18.120
Dad, we can't bury Nana
in a dresser from kea.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.726
This is why your mother
buys my clothes.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.897
I hate to shop. I hate it.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.759
Isn't this more about
the fact that...

09:27.967 --> 09:32.461
...once you decide, it's like
acknowledging Nana's actually gone?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.897
No, I really hate to shop.

09:41.948 --> 09:47.215
-I thought it'd be a closed casket.
-lt doesn't mean she can't look nice.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.718
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

09:55.161 --> 09:56.856
I don't see why not.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.743
Here's my retainer.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.353
I was just thinking...

10:28.761 --> 10:30.661
-...when my time comes
-Dad.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.090
Listen to me.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.564
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.297
You what?

10:42.141 --> 10:45.235
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.877
Define "fun. "

10:49.081 --> 10:53.211
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch....

10:53.552 --> 10:57.852
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

10:58.057 --> 11:02.994
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says I'm so predictable.

11:03.229 --> 11:07.962
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
" Buried at sea? Huh? "

11:11.303 --> 11:13.430
That's probably what they'll say.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.566
I'd like that.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.785
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hey.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.787
Look, l' m sorry about yesterday.

11:33.059 --> 11:37.291
Don't worry. Apparently, other people
have made the same mistake.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.293
Okay. Phew!

11:43.102 --> 11:45.798
So, what do you think it is about me?

11:46.939 --> 11:48.133
I don't know what.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.240
You just have...

11:50.443 --> 11:52.502
-...a quality.
-A quality. Great.

11:52.845 --> 11:56.508
It's a shame. You and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

11:58.350 --> 12:02.548
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

12:02.855 --> 12:03.913
What? He's cute.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.554
Well, yeah.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.916
He's no Brian in Payroll.

12:10.930 --> 12:11.988
Is Brian?

12:12.231 --> 12:15.291
I don't know. If you
were gonna set me up...

12:15.501 --> 12:18.766
... I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.472
Brian's a little out of your league.

12:26.612 --> 12:30.548
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

12:33.519 --> 12:36.784
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.981
I'm really not.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.521
This one?

12:46.966 --> 12:49.264
I've shown you every dress we have.

12:49.468 --> 12:53.700
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...

12:53.939 --> 12:56.032
...go with the burgundy.

12:56.709 --> 13:00.008
Whatever we pick, she'd say
it's the wrong one.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.509
Right. We'll go with the burgundy.

13:02.748 --> 13:05.512
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.413
Wait! We need shoes.

13:16.028 --> 13:19.293
-How about these?
-That's really a day shoe.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.728
Where she's going
everyone else will be dressier?

13:24.036 --> 13:26.596
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

13:31.243 --> 13:35.509
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.307
I can show you something
silver that may work.

13:40.352 --> 13:45.016
-No, it really should be burgundy.
-Unless we go with a different dress.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.225
No, no, no. Watch this.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.690
Wait, I may have something
in the back.

14:03.542 --> 14:04.770
Oh, my God.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.938
Is everything all right?

14:09.882 --> 14:11.975
Just Nana's stuff.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.501
You guys ready?

14:30.836 --> 14:33.669
Mom called to tell me
not to wear my hair up.

14:33.906 --> 14:38.741
-Know my ears aren't my best feature?
-Some days it's all I can think about.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.605
I' m sorry l' m late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.638
You mean your earrings?

14:45.217 --> 14:46.445
What did I say?

14:48.554 --> 14:52.012
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from ltaly.

14:52.324 --> 14:55.316
What? We don't have shoes here?

14:57.496 --> 15:01.523
-Morning. We ready to go?
-Don't we look nice all dressed up?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.597
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

15:17.349 --> 15:20.580
-lt was a really beautiful service.
-lt really was.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.019
Come here, sweetheart.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.797
You know, I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

15:38.971 --> 15:39.960
What?

15:40.172 --> 15:44.404
Nothing. Just that your coat
sounds like Brent Musberger.

15:44.977 --> 15:50.643
-Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
-You're watching football at a funeral?

15:50.916 --> 15:54.647
No, it's the pre-game.
I' m gonna watch it at the reception.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.454
You're a frightening, frightening man.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.723
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

16:01.994 --> 16:03.791
I hope they're not ruined.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.127
God, what a great day!

16:10.970 --> 16:13.029
What? Weather-wise.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.772
I know.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.843
The air, the trees.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.508
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life

16:25.585 --> 16:27.519
Ross, are you okay?

16:27.753 --> 16:29.084
No, l' m fine.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.847
Just...

16:32.124 --> 16:34.615
... having my worst fear
realized, but....

16:42.802 --> 16:45.930
I' m just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.136
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.505
Okay, it's in spasm.

16:55.681 --> 16:59.777
Here, sweetie. I took these
when I had my gall thing accident.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.643
Thanks, Mom.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.688
Sorry.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.121
Hi, l' m Andrea.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.499
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

17:15.768 --> 17:19.295
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.332
Look who's up!

17:24.811 --> 17:28.611
-How do you feel?
-I feel great.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.481
I feel great. I feel great.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.045
Wow, those pills really worked.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.323
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two....

17:42.896 --> 17:44.557
I love you guys.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.635
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.064
I love Pheebs.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.237
That's so nice.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.066
I love you, man.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.005
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.447
It doesn't matter to me.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.211
You were right.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.364
I do love you.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.165
Oh, Ross. I love you too.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.503
Oh, no, I really love you.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.648
I really love you.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.252
Oh, you don't get it!

18:46.659 --> 18:51.392
-What do you got there?
-Just a hearing disability.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.827
What's the score?

18:55.034 --> 18:58.162
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.395
Beautiful!

19:08.348 --> 19:11.806
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.788
Your grandmother would've hated this.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.358
Sure. What with it being
her funeral and all.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.927
No, I'd be hearing about...

19:25.198 --> 19:27.860
...why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

19:28.134 --> 19:31.695
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
Or she'd say:

19:31.905 --> 19:35.341
"Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, l' m dead. "

19:36.176 --> 19:37.871
That sounds like Nana.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.904
Do you know what it's like
to grow up...

19:42.549 --> 19:46.883
...with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.749
I can imagine.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.824
It's a wonder your mother
turned out...

19:55.094 --> 19:58.689
...to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.990
That is a wonder.

20:04.637 --> 20:09.404
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again...

20:09.642 --> 20:12.668
... I mean, if she was here
right now...

20:13.179 --> 20:14.874
...would you tell her?

20:15.114 --> 20:16.103
T ell her what?

20:17.517 --> 20:21.954
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.253
Like your hair, for example.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.754
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

20:30.063 --> 20:34.329
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.038
Some things are better left unsaid.

20:43.309 --> 20:46.142
It's nicer when people just get along.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.342
More wine?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.378
Oh, I think so.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.391
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.793
Thank you.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.894
They're yours.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.896
Actually, they were Nana's.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.306
Now l' m depressed!

21:23.783 --> 21:26.013
Even more than I was.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.284
Oh, look. My first grade picture.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.260
Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt.

21:39.565 --> 21:43.934
-Hey, who's this little naked guy?
-That little naked guy would be me.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.333
Look at the little thing!

21:50.143 --> 21:52.771
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.344
Can we be grownups now?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.481
Who are those people?

21:57.750 --> 22:01.481
-Got me.
-That's Nana right there in the middle.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.715
Yeah, let's see.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.653
" Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "

22:06.859 --> 22:10.420
You look just like your grandmother.
How old was she?

22:10.730 --> 22:12.664
Let's see, " 1 939. "

22:13.299 --> 22:14.891
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.964
It looks like a fun gang.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.939
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

22:27.180 --> 22:28.670
Let me see!

22:30.883 --> 22:33.181
No, no. That would be me again.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.389
I'm just trying something.

22:50.903 --> 22:51.892
Hey, Lowell.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.500
Oh, hey, Chandler.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.233
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

22:58.544 --> 23:01.877
It's like Mardi Gras without
the papier-mache heads.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.173
How about you?

23:03.383 --> 23:05.351
Good. Good. Listen...

23:07.220 --> 23:10.348
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but...

23:11.491 --> 23:12.856
... I' m not.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.188
I know. That's what I told her.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.856
Really?

23:19.232 --> 23:20.961
So you can tell?

23:22.835 --> 23:27.135
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.975
So you don't think I have...

23:31.177 --> 23:32.439
...a quality?

23:32.912 --> 23:36.814
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

23:39.385 --> 23:42.684
By the way, your friend Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

23:43.356 --> 23:46.484
-He is?
-And way out of your league.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.561
Out of my league!

23:51.764 --> 23:56.167
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.265
Hey, Brian.
