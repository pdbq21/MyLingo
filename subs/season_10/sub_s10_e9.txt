WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.809
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04.812 --> 00:06.930
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.

00:07.134 --> 00:09.286
Oh, right, your adoption interview.

00:09.496 --> 00:12.172
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.

00:12.379 --> 00:16.376
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

00:16.544 --> 00:18.342
And so incorrect.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.826
She's only a few months pregnant.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.220
She liked our application
but might not like us.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.343
Come on, she's gonna love you guys.

00:25.513 --> 00:27.904
Thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.

00:28.315 --> 00:29.875
A lot could still get in our way.

00:30.037 --> 00:32.918
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.474
What are you gonna name it?

00:34.882 --> 00:38.595
I could develop a condition in which
I talk and talk and no one hears a word.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.724
But just think, okay?
What if everything goes right?

00:42.890 --> 00:45.008
What if this woman does pick you guys?

00:46.213 --> 00:49.208
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

00:49.416 --> 00:51.887
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?

00:52.700 --> 00:55.421
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...

00:55.583 --> 00:58.338
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

00:58.546 --> 01:00.378
- Yes. But...
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!

01:00.548 --> 01:02.062
We're gonna make it work!

01:02.229 --> 01:04.507
I'm gonna be a mommy,
and you're gonna be a daddy!

01:04.672 --> 01:07.393
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!

01:11.919 --> 01:13.912
Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!

01:16.644 --> 01:18.637
The One With the Birth Mother

01:56.323 --> 01:57.599
Hey, who's Phoebe with?

01:59.246 --> 02:02.127
I wanna say, "Someone
I'm gonna have sex with."

02:05.012 --> 02:06.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:06.934 --> 02:09.974
- So who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.

02:10.538 --> 02:12.177
No. Don't you get any ideas.

02:12.339 --> 02:14.697
I'm not setting you up
with any more of my friends.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.338
- Why? Why?
- Because you'll date her once...

02:17.505 --> 02:19.462
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.

02:19.627 --> 02:21.665
Name one friend of yours I did that with.

02:21.869 --> 02:24.101
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh?

02:24.592 --> 02:26.744
Really hot blond, big boobs?

02:27.955 --> 02:31.588
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember, huh?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.873
Do you think I'm someone else?

02:39.366 --> 02:42.281
Look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.

02:42.449 --> 02:45.285
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?

02:45.492 --> 02:47.325
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.

02:47.494 --> 02:49.327
I mean, when Joey
and I were together...

02:49.496 --> 02:53.540
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.

02:53.701 --> 02:56.582
And for the one week
that we went out...

02:57.344 --> 02:59.064
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.224
Growth.

03:03.390 --> 03:06.112
- Fine, I'll give you her number.
- Okay. Thank you.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.311
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.

03:08.475 --> 03:09.796
- Mandy.
- Sarah!

03:09.997 --> 03:11.717
Sarah.

03:14.001 --> 03:15.276
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:15.442 --> 03:17.640
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.

03:19.446 --> 03:21.200
How does this look?

03:26.493 --> 03:28.930
Well, it's... It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.

03:30.618 --> 03:32.052
A little bit more.

03:32.219 --> 03:33.540
A little bit more.

03:33.741 --> 03:35.061
There you go.

03:36.904 --> 03:38.497
Now throw it away.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.258
Come on! This looks good.

03:41.428 --> 03:44.742
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.

03:44.912 --> 03:48.271
Now I don't know who's running
for president or who that NATO guy is...

03:48.435 --> 03:51.316
...but I do know that you
have to get far away from that hat.

03:51.679 --> 03:53.033
Damn it. God...

03:53.200 --> 03:55.956
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.

03:56.123 --> 03:59.402
If you want fashion help, Rachel and I
are going shopping tomorrow.

03:59.567 --> 04:02.562
- You're welcome to come with us.
- Really? That would be great.

04:02.730 --> 04:04.164
I mean, I have to do something.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.244
She kind of teased me
about how I dress.

04:06.453 --> 04:07.968
I can see why. Nice shirt.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.174
You're wearing the same shirt.

04:13.941 --> 04:15.934
Stupid Gap on every corner!

04:23.951 --> 04:26.593
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.

04:26.754 --> 04:28.473
Okay, thank you.

04:29.517 --> 04:32.192
Well, this is it.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.557
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?

04:34.722 --> 04:39.242
It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have
the human growing inside you?"

04:41.128 --> 04:42.403
You're gonna be great.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.244
You're gonna be great.

04:44.411 --> 04:46.848
Well, obviously.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.528
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.

04:50.698 --> 04:53.294
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.418
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.097
- Hi.
- I'll let you get acquainted.

04:57.264 --> 05:00.304
- Okay.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?

05:00.508 --> 05:04.585
I only know you as
"File CRW33815-D."

05:05.152 --> 05:07.589
That's what our friends call us.

05:08.235 --> 05:12.278
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...

05:12.439 --> 05:13.715
...kind of intimidating.

05:13.921 --> 05:15.720
I don't know about that.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.719
Are you kidding me?
I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.205
But on top of it,
you're married to a reverend?

05:27.334 --> 05:30.409
- I don't think that's exactly...
- Let her finish, doctor.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:36.463 --> 05:38.775
My friend Sarah
had a great time last night.

05:38.946 --> 05:41.622
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?

05:41.829 --> 05:43.549
No.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.344
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.066
Oh, really? You want to know
what your "great" friend did?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.872
We're out to dinner, okay?

05:52.039 --> 05:54.396
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.

05:54.602 --> 05:56.355
I was thinking she was really cool.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.000
And then, out of nowhere...

06:20.988 --> 06:22.388
That's it?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.827
That's why you won't
go out with her again?

06:24.992 --> 06:26.586
So she took some fries. Big deal.

06:26.794 --> 06:28.991
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.955
It's about what the fries represent.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.435
- What?
- All food!

06:34.041 --> 06:35.715
Well, I'm sorry.

06:35.883 --> 06:39.003
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!

06:39.166 --> 06:41.204
Hey, look, I take a girl out...

06:41.368 --> 06:44.488
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?

06:44.652 --> 06:48.535
Just don't order a garden salad
and then eat my food!

06:49.336 --> 06:51.135
That's a good way to lose some fingers.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.698
- Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
- What?

06:55.903 --> 06:59.455
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...

06:59.627 --> 07:02.382
...and takes a few of his fries...
- Oh, no!

07:02.590 --> 07:04.583
What?

07:05.352 --> 07:07.823
You know about the plate thing?

07:08.035 --> 07:10.426
Oh, yeah, yeah. No,
Joey doesn't share food.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.239
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...

07:13.400 --> 07:15.313
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.

07:15.523 --> 07:17.720
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
- No, not me.

07:17.885 --> 07:19.160
Emma.

07:21.849 --> 07:24.490
Joey doesn't share food!

07:28.736 --> 07:31.970
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.

07:32.179 --> 07:34.331
You are calling her, okay?

07:34.542 --> 07:37.935
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.103
I like that.

07:44.271 --> 07:46.549
A sharing buffer. Yeah.

07:46.714 --> 07:50.027
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.

07:50.397 --> 07:51.832
Yeah. Yeah.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.271
And a shrimp cocktail.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.596
And some Buffalo wings.

07:56.764 --> 07:59.679
Maybe...
Maybe an individual pizza, huh?

07:59.847 --> 08:02.238
And some mozzarella sticks.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.130
What were we talking about?

08:09.777 --> 08:11.735
Wow, this place is awesome.

08:11.939 --> 08:14.375
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.

08:14.542 --> 08:15.896
This stuff is ridiculous.

08:16.103 --> 08:18.666
Oh, this place is great!

08:20.427 --> 08:23.548
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
any of this. Nothing silver.

08:23.751 --> 08:26.666
- Why?
- Okay, nothing with hair.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.470
And nothing with padlocks on it!

08:29.637 --> 08:32.472
Ross, look. Look, I know that some
of this stuff is out there.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.236
But I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.

08:35.402 --> 08:37.076
I mean, this is just beautiful.

08:37.244 --> 08:39.362
Wow, this is really soft.

08:40.247 --> 08:41.967
Three hundred and fifty dollars?

08:42.169 --> 08:46.291
Down from 700.
You're saving, like, 200 bucks.

08:47.975 --> 08:51.972
Both logic and math are taking
a serious hit today.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.581
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.018
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.345
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.

09:03.511 --> 09:04.831
Yeah.

09:07.995 --> 09:09.874
"Boys will be boys"?

09:10.998 --> 09:13.116
- What? They will be!
- All right.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.275
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
- No, Ross, wait, come on.

09:16.483 --> 09:20.366
There's other stuff here. There's some
nice shirts, these nice pants.

09:20.568 --> 09:22.606
Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.491
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.

09:25.653 --> 09:29.205
All right? I know your size, and I'll
pick out some really good stuff for you.

09:29.416 --> 09:30.737
- Really?
- Yes.

09:30.898 --> 09:32.332
I know what looks sexy on guys.

09:32.540 --> 09:35.501
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.

09:35.703 --> 09:37.023
So you're saying...

09:37.184 --> 09:41.181
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?

09:42.389 --> 09:44.427
Why do men keep talking to me like this?

09:47.234 --> 09:50.434
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...

09:50.598 --> 09:51.998
...that's important to you?

09:52.159 --> 09:54.038
Yeah. I read some great applications...

09:54.201 --> 09:57.116
...but I thought, "Who better
than a minister to raise a child?"

09:57.324 --> 09:58.805
Amen.

10:00.608 --> 10:03.921
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.

10:04.131 --> 10:05.612
Good hands.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.766
Healing hands.

10:08.896 --> 10:12.096
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?

10:12.299 --> 10:14.178
It says, "Do it."

10:15.823 --> 10:20.457
"And behold, she did adopt
unto them a baby.

10:22.029 --> 10:24.465
And it was good."

10:25.753 --> 10:28.907
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

10:29.717 --> 10:32.028
I was wondering...
You both have such serious jobs.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.160
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?

10:35.362 --> 10:37.480
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

10:37.645 --> 10:40.799
Yeah. My flock pretty much
takes care of themselves by this point.

10:40.968 --> 10:43.086
Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.729
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.

10:47.935 --> 10:50.577
Not for me it doesn't.

10:50.738 --> 10:52.731
So how's everything going in here?

10:52.900 --> 10:55.416
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.381
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

10:57.545 --> 11:01.143
Yeah, actually.
So you read a file that you liked...

11:01.308 --> 11:04.748
...and then you gave the agency
the serial number and they contacted us?

11:04.952 --> 11:07.149
Yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.

11:07.314 --> 11:10.229
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.639
You're really on top of stuff.

11:13.801 --> 11:17.319
Well then, if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.

11:17.484 --> 11:18.965
I actually...

11:19.126 --> 11:21.323
- I don't think we have to.
- We don't?

11:21.488 --> 11:24.609
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...

11:24.772 --> 11:27.288
...but I just thought we should meet
face to face.

11:27.494 --> 11:29.567
I've made my decision.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.531
I choose them.

11:32.019 --> 11:33.932
God, this is great.

11:34.101 --> 11:35.900
This is so great. Did you hear that?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.578
Yeah, I did.

11:37.785 --> 11:39.219
Hey.

11:39.426 --> 11:42.786
Thank you. Thank you so much.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.145
You are so going to heaven!

11:52.079 --> 11:55.358
- We got some really great stuff.
- Yeah.

11:55.523 --> 11:57.914
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some
of the bras I got.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.556
Really? Do you want to try
some of them on for me?

12:00.768 --> 12:02.043
Okay.

12:02.209 --> 12:04.806
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

12:06.854 --> 12:10.167
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.

12:10.337 --> 12:12.136
And one of mine is missing.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.611
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.

12:20.227 --> 12:23.302
So, what do you think?

12:25.392 --> 12:28.547
I think we're not wearing
the same shirt anymore.

12:29.517 --> 12:31.669
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

12:31.839 --> 12:34.561
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.

12:34.722 --> 12:37.238
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.

12:39.406 --> 12:42.207
Dude, I really don't think
you should be wearing that.

12:42.770 --> 12:44.204
I see.

12:44.371 --> 12:48.448
Somebody's afraid of a little competition
with the ladies?

12:48.656 --> 12:51.890
Looks like someone is the ladies!

12:52.499 --> 12:55.335
You're just jealous
because you couldn't pull this off.

12:55.543 --> 12:59.175
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

13:00.948 --> 13:05.309
See? All eyes on me!

13:09.797 --> 13:12.712
- We are not signing those papers.
- Why not?

13:13.040 --> 13:16.433
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.

13:16.644 --> 13:19.035
God works in mysterious ways.

13:19.887 --> 13:21.845
You have got to stop.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.850
But she liked us.

13:24.051 --> 13:26.727
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.529
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.

13:30.698 --> 13:37.098
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.

13:37.665 --> 13:40.626
Your veal chop is 34.95!

13:41.909 --> 13:44.551
Come on, I just...
I think we've been given an opportunity.

13:44.712 --> 13:47.548
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.

13:47.755 --> 13:49.554
But we're not the ones she chose.

13:49.717 --> 13:51.710
How can you feel okay about this?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.079
Because.

13:55.242 --> 13:58.396
We may not be who she thinks we are...

13:58.566 --> 14:01.207
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.889
- I know.
- I mean, who knows...

14:03.050 --> 14:05.931
...how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby?

14:06.093 --> 14:08.564
What if no one ever picks us?

14:08.736 --> 14:10.329
Oh, honey...

14:10.497 --> 14:12.012
Please?

14:12.179 --> 14:14.571
Please. We are so close.

14:16.383 --> 14:18.661
Monica, I want a baby too.

14:18.826 --> 14:21.023
But this woman is giving away her child.

14:21.188 --> 14:23.944
She deserves to know who it's going to.

14:30.918 --> 14:32.956
Okay. You're right.

14:34.802 --> 14:37.113
So we'll tell the truth.

14:37.284 --> 14:40.644
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.

14:43.170 --> 14:44.969
Maybe she will.

14:45.773 --> 14:47.606
Why couldn't I have been a reverend?

14:47.815 --> 14:49.933
You're Jewish.

14:51.298 --> 14:53.416
Technicality!

14:58.506 --> 15:00.179
Garden salad for the lady.

15:00.347 --> 15:03.502
Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.

15:03.671 --> 15:07.383
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.

15:07.555 --> 15:09.194
Enjoy.

15:11.478 --> 15:12.993
Those fries look delicious.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.352
I didn't know you liked French fries.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.244
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.408
Wow, are those stuffed clams?

15:28.976 --> 15:31.208
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.

15:33.581 --> 15:36.381
How about those fries, though, huh?

15:37.104 --> 15:40.065
- They are delicious.
- Yeah.

15:42.790 --> 15:46.149
You are beautiful, you know that?

15:47.314 --> 15:49.113
That is so sweet.

15:50.758 --> 15:52.955
Okay, then.

16:03.931 --> 16:05.969
Now look what you did!

16:06.133 --> 16:08.251
What? What is the matter with you?

16:08.455 --> 16:11.656
I don't like it when people
take food off of my plate, okay?

16:11.859 --> 16:13.738
But you said, "What's mine is yours."

16:13.941 --> 16:15.535
Well, I didn't mean it!

16:16.824 --> 16:21.026
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

16:22.550 --> 16:24.428
No, I'm sorry. I...

16:24.592 --> 16:28.874
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, I...

16:29.036 --> 16:30.517
...have certain rules...

16:30.718 --> 16:32.391
...okay? I mean...

16:32.600 --> 16:37.359
...there are things you do, and,
you know, things that you don't do.

16:44.051 --> 16:45.611
Wow, this place looks great.

16:45.773 --> 16:50.089
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

16:50.257 --> 16:53.172
- Me too.
- Here.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.586
So this was fun.

17:11.318 --> 17:14.154
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.

17:14.321 --> 17:16.838
And I want to make sure you
know I really do like you.

17:17.044 --> 17:19.686
Sure, just not as much as clams.

17:19.887 --> 17:21.561
Well, stuffed clams...

17:23.490 --> 17:25.323
Chocolate torte for the lady.

17:25.492 --> 17:27.531
Cheesecake for the gentleman.

17:27.735 --> 17:32.290
Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some
sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.659
Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

17:35.863 --> 17:38.903
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.

17:40.628 --> 17:42.825
Oh, my God.

17:43.030 --> 17:45.466
- I'll just have what she's having.
- I'm sorry, sir.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.386
That was our last piece.

17:51.519 --> 17:53.671
Oh, no.

17:53.841 --> 17:56.403
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?

17:56.604 --> 17:58.722
Yeah, sure. No problem.

18:00.808 --> 18:03.962
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?

18:04.171 --> 18:05.686
Sure I do.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.686
Coulis?

18:07.895 --> 18:11.574
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.

18:11.739 --> 18:13.298
This is a two-way street.

18:15.903 --> 18:17.496
Really?

18:18.225 --> 18:19.501
Really.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.263
Now this all better be here
when I come back.

18:22.429 --> 18:26.028
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.

18:37.805 --> 18:40.082
Stop staring at me!

18:50.417 --> 18:53.731
Just a tiny little...

19:06.874 --> 19:09.310
I'm not even sorry.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.993
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:15.162 --> 19:19.079
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption.

19:19.286 --> 19:22.008
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.

19:24.051 --> 19:26.123
- Is that a picture?
- Yeah.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.691
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.

19:28.856 --> 19:30.449
I thought you might want to see it.

19:37.705 --> 19:39.618
Look, doctor.

19:43.511 --> 19:46.586
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.

19:49.997 --> 19:51.796
We're not who you think we are.

19:51.999 --> 19:54.914
- I don't understand.
- The agency must have made a mistake.

19:55.122 --> 19:57.923
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.

19:58.125 --> 19:59.958
- What?
- That's impossible.

20:00.167 --> 20:03.321
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.

20:05.052 --> 20:08.013
I have to check your file. Excuse me.

20:08.215 --> 20:09.490
So who are you?

20:09.697 --> 20:12.658
Our names really are Monica and
Chandler. We're from New York.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.131
Yeah, but the important thing
to know about us...

20:15.302 --> 20:18.297
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.

20:18.506 --> 20:20.384
So you lied to me before?

20:20.588 --> 20:24.061
Well, we "bore false witness."

20:25.432 --> 20:27.824
See? I could be a reverend.

20:28.796 --> 20:30.230
I can't believe this.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.874
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...

20:33.040 --> 20:36.035
...that you still might consider...
- Giving you my baby?

20:36.203 --> 20:38.241
You think I'd give you my child
after this?

20:38.445 --> 20:40.962
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file...

20:41.128 --> 20:44.089
I don't want to look at your file.
This is over.

20:48.335 --> 20:50.009
Erica, wait.

20:50.177 --> 20:52.056
I have nothing to say to you.

20:52.219 --> 20:54.291
Look, you have every reason to be upset.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.816
We did lie.

20:56.023 --> 20:59.906
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.

21:00.067 --> 21:03.380
And we don't know how long it's gonna
be before we get another chance.

21:03.591 --> 21:05.629
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?

21:05.793 --> 21:08.549
Erica, please.

21:08.756 --> 21:12.753
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.799
Our last name's Bing.

21:14.962 --> 21:17.398
My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.239
Oh, yeah.

21:20.407 --> 21:22.844
I actually liked you guys.

21:24.251 --> 21:26.369
But it doesn't matter.
What you did was wrong.

21:26.574 --> 21:28.965
But you did like us.

21:29.136 --> 21:31.049
And you should.

21:31.539 --> 21:33.691
My wife's an incredible woman.

21:33.861 --> 21:37.744
She is loving, and devoted and caring.

21:38.145 --> 21:41.903
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.832
I love my wife more than anything
in this world.

21:50.077 --> 21:51.592
And it...

21:52.680 --> 21:55.880
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

22:01.168 --> 22:03.445
I really want a kid.

22:04.491 --> 22:08.044
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.

22:08.616 --> 22:10.289
But my wife...

22:10.778 --> 22:12.816
...she's already there.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.053
She's a mother...

22:16.103 --> 22:18.061
...without a baby.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.626
Please?

22:38.005 --> 22:40.077
You still want that baby?

22:55.102 --> 22:57.174
God bless you, Chandler Bing!

23:10.357 --> 23:12.874
Turns out this sweater
is made for a woman.

23:15.162 --> 23:17.075
So why are you still wearing it?

23:17.284 --> 23:18.765
Because it's soft.

23:20.728 --> 23:22.208
Hey, so how was your date?

23:22.409 --> 23:24.129
Not so good.

23:25.853 --> 23:30.214
Well, looks like it's just
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?

23:30.377 --> 23:33.292
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.498
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:37.585 --> 23:40.385
Joey doesn't share food!

23:41.228 --> 23:43.221
