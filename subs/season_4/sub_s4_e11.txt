WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:05.901
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

00:08.742 --> 00:11.267
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

00:11.444 --> 00:14.208
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch

00:14.414 --> 00:16.075
Why were you at the courthouse?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.843
We were having lunch.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.780
We were like...

00:21.054 --> 00:25.218
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

00:25.425 --> 00:29.759
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

00:33.066 --> 00:34.863
Oh, it's so great.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.528
Okay.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.697
Okay.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.306
Stop it! Don't!

00:45.278 --> 00:46.939
I'll get you a gift now.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.206
Is there anything you need?

00:52.752 --> 00:57.712
We've been trying to get pregnant since
we got engaged, to get a jump on things.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.717
No one's getting any younger.

01:02.162 --> 01:06.724
Because the thing is, we're not
able to, you know, conceive.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.163
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

01:09.436 --> 01:12.496
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

01:12.739 --> 01:17.836
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

01:18.111 --> 01:20.079
...and put it into another girl.

01:20.313 --> 01:24.010
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.981
That's a really nice gift.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.492
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.926
We know it's a lot to ask.

01:39.065 --> 01:42.159
We don't have anyone else to go to.
We could pay someone...

01:42.302 --> 01:44.099
...but we don't have
that kind of money.

01:44.237 --> 01:47.001
Plus, you know, you're
family and, you know...

01:47.140 --> 01:52.476
...I just don't want my baby to grow into
some chick I don't know, you know?

01:53.246 --> 01:55.612
Don't give us an answer yet,
think about it.

01:55.748 --> 02:01.084
And if you say no,
we'll totally understand.

02:01.421 --> 02:05.050
Okay. Okay.

02:05.792 --> 02:11.196
And we were wondering if you could
give us a ride down to the train station.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.292
Well, actually, we kind of need
an answer to that one right now.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.369
The One with Phoebe's Uterus

03:06.319 --> 03:09.584
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

03:12.158 --> 03:16.322
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

03:17.597 --> 03:18.586
What?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.532
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

03:23.603 --> 03:27.369
You said "black." Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

03:29.108 --> 03:30.871
Well, you know what I meant.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.542
You messed it up.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.012
You're stupid.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.614
So, what job did you get?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.884
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

03:44.123 --> 03:47.320
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

03:47.527 --> 03:49.859
They give you
all the information.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.495
It's like memorizing a script.

03:52.699 --> 03:57.102
On your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.064
Very nice.

03:59.305 --> 04:02.866
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.809
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.881
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!

04:12.485 --> 04:13.918
Oh, my God!

04:14.153 --> 04:15.586
They're having a baby!

04:17.557 --> 04:20.754
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

04:24.497 --> 04:26.556
-My God!
-Are you serious?

04:27.934 --> 04:31.392
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

04:34.507 --> 04:37.032
Ew! And, oh, no!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.570
They want me to be the surrogate.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.875
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

04:45.585 --> 04:46.882
What did you say?

04:47.086 --> 04:51.045
I had to think about it first,
but what is there to think of?

04:51.257 --> 04:54.590
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

04:54.861 --> 04:59.025
You'll carry their child
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.034
This is an incredible thing to do.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.931
But there are things to think about.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.505
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean, pregnant.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.701
I know.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.871
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.380
I mean, morning sickness, labor.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.244
It's all for somebody else.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.319
Yeah. What's your point?

05:24.123 --> 05:26.956
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.458
I couldn't do that.

05:29.729 --> 05:34.462
I always figured the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.362
And that baby was, you know...

05:36.636 --> 05:38.126
...a keeper.

05:38.905 --> 05:43.365
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

05:43.576 --> 05:47.410
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.080
Just think it through.

05:49.315 --> 05:52.478
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

05:52.719 --> 05:57.588
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

06:03.930 --> 06:07.923
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

06:08.368 --> 06:12.327
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.943
I am so jealous.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.705
You guys are just right there.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.748
Yes.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.510
Right where?

06:26.686 --> 06:30.588
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

06:30.857 --> 06:33.417
...and sex and talking.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.754
You got to love the talking.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.864
-And the sex?
-We haven't had sex.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.365
What's the big deal?
This is special.

06:43.603 --> 06:47.369
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.035
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.040
That is really nice...

06:52.245 --> 06:53.712
...Iying!

06:55.181 --> 06:57.877
-No way is that the reason.
-Why?

06:58.084 --> 07:01.076
Because you're not mature enough
to understand that?

07:01.287 --> 07:03.380
He's right. I'm totally lying.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.689
Then what is it?

07:09.896 --> 07:11.955
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

07:12.432 --> 07:17.529
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

07:19.572 --> 07:22.769
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

07:23.576 --> 07:27.603
-I was going for the metaphor.
-I was saying the actual words.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.783
He's had a lot of girlfriends.
Doesn't mean he's great in bed.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.819
We share a wall.

07:37.557 --> 07:41.425
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.830
Loudly and a lot.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.935
All night long she'd agree.

07:50.670 --> 07:55.334
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you're in love.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.670
-Just go for it.
-Yeah, you should.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.847
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.383
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

08:10.490 --> 08:15.257
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.254
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.362
This is a museum. No talking.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.895
Right down here we have...

08:27.673 --> 08:29.163
...a large foot.

08:32.612 --> 08:35.672
And over here we have Ross Geller.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.007
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.447
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.488
Okay, moving right along.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.059
Come on.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.693
It's open. Come in.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.827
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-That's okay.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.629
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.901
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.606
I was working on my pottery.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.851
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

09:16.422 --> 09:21.155
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: pottery and erotica.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.294
Erottery!

09:25.698 --> 09:27.666
Thanks for coming out to see me.

09:27.934 --> 09:32.894
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.365
I don't think it's a good idea.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.075
Why not?

09:39.679 --> 09:41.579
You'd be giving up a baby.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.576
And I really don't

09:43.849 --> 09:45.840
I don't know if anything I said...

09:46.085 --> 09:49.953
...would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.694
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

09:59.332 --> 10:01.095
No, no. The puppy is yours.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.561
-I get a puppy?
-But for only three days.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.200
Why?

10:09.575 --> 10:14.706
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parent-y on you now.

10:20.853 --> 10:24.152
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.321
I know what I'm talking about.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.385
I gave up two babies.

10:30.663 --> 10:35.396
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

10:35.668 --> 10:37.533
...how terrible it is.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.672
I really shouldn't have
given you the puppy first.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.038
That's okay.
No, we're listening.

10:48.514 --> 10:53.042
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.515
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

11:00.026 --> 11:04.190
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

11:04.930 --> 11:08.832
Okay, fair enough. Three days.

11:10.636 --> 11:14.333
Oh, it's time to take
my ass out of the kiln.

11:19.545 --> 11:23.140
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.646
You mean Dr. Geller?

11:24.984 --> 11:28.044
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.151
Oh, he won't sit here.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.516
Only people in white coats
sit there.

11:33.826 --> 11:36.693
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.090
-How come?
-That's just the way it is.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.163
That's crazy.

11:42.468 --> 11:47.701
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world:
a world without lab coats and blazers.

11:47.973 --> 11:51.272
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.078
See that scientist?

11:55.715 --> 12:00.243
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now....

12:01.087 --> 12:03.749
Peter! Hey, Peter!

12:04.557 --> 12:07.993
It's me! Rhonda, from P.S. 129?

12:08.828 --> 12:11.456
I shared my pudding with you, man!

12:12.898 --> 12:15.662
I gave you my Snack Pack!

12:17.002 --> 12:20.836
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

12:22.241 --> 12:24.937
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

12:26.512 --> 12:30.312
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

12:30.516 --> 12:32.006
...but Ross is my friend.

12:32.284 --> 12:36.448
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.787
Here! I saved you a seat!

12:44.363 --> 12:47.491
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.536
This is saved.

12:56.242 --> 12:57.937
Gift shop.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.616
I'm really, really sorry about what
happened in the cafeteria today.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.118
You do what you got to do.

13:14.326 --> 13:18.695
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

13:20.599 --> 13:21.588
Whatever.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.600
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.967
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

13:28.174 --> 13:30.699
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

13:31.043 --> 13:35.343
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

13:36.615 --> 13:40.608
Okay, Rach, when was the last time
you had lunch with the shipping clerks?

13:40.786 --> 13:43.277
I've never had lunch
with the shipping clerks...

13:43.422 --> 13:48.052
...but it's totally different. They're not
allowed in the executive cafeteria.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.822
Oh, I see what you're saying.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.893
Look, Ross.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.694
It's no big deal.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.201
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.896
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.904
I understand, you know?

14:04.276 --> 14:08.975
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.247
So it's, you know, it's cool.

14:12.484 --> 14:13.951
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:17.156 --> 14:21.024
When we're in the audience,
he doesn't talk but he does wave.

14:25.497 --> 14:31.197
Who's my puppy? Who's my puppy?
Who's my puppy?

14:31.337 --> 14:35.398
-Have you named him yet?
-No, I don't want to get attached.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.601
-Can I hold him?
-Sure. Here.

14:38.777 --> 14:42.474
-Come here, squirmy. Hello
-Not like that. No.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.781
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?

14:55.561 --> 14:58.621
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.092
Come on, let's go to the balcony.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.758
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

15:04.970 --> 15:08.406
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.368
So did you do it?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.077
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.305
It was bad?

15:17.516 --> 15:22.453
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.953
She was like, "l see your point.
I'm all right with it."

15:29.728 --> 15:33.425
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

15:33.732 --> 15:37.566
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.597
Look, you have to help me.

15:40.839 --> 15:41.999
I mean....

15:42.241 --> 15:46.735
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.274
I need to know...

15:48.480 --> 15:50.471
...what makes it go from nice to:

15:50.749 --> 15:53.582
"My God! Somebody's killing her
in there!"

15:54.520 --> 15:57.751
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.753
All right.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.255
Now.

16:02.528 --> 16:06.328
You don't have to draw an actual
Whoa, she's hot!

16:07.866 --> 16:10.130
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.859
You got one, two, three...

16:12.671 --> 16:13.933
...four...

16:14.606 --> 16:17.302
...five, six and seven.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.266
There are seven?

16:20.179 --> 16:21.771
Let me see that.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.475
Oh, yeah.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.675
That's one?

16:27.953 --> 16:29.716
Kind of an important one.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.780
I was looking at it upside down.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.228
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.

16:43.369 --> 16:48.204
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.567
That's bad?

16:51.877 --> 16:55.813
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.479
You might if it were like seven.

17:00.152 --> 17:04.555
All right, the important thing
is to take your time.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.484
You want to hit them all...

17:06.692 --> 17:09.024
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.492
Oh, toes!

17:16.702 --> 17:18.260
For some people.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.561
All right.

17:20.773 --> 17:24.231
You could start out
with a little one.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.772
A two.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.342
A one, two, three.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.204
A three.

17:30.416 --> 17:31.713
A five.

17:32.684 --> 17:33.673
A four.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.584
A three, two.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.845
Two. A two, four, six.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.552
Two, four, six.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.420
Four. Two.

17:42.961 --> 17:46.397
Two. Four, seven!

17:46.532 --> 17:49.023
Five, seven! Six, seven!

17:49.268 --> 17:51.634
Seven! Seven!

17:51.904 --> 17:55.362
Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven!
Seven! Seven!

17:55.507 --> 17:57.407
Seven!

18:03.782 --> 18:05.841
And there you are.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.052
Yeah, that'll work.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.469
Dr. Geller?
There's a seat here.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.901
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.701
But I'm having my lunch...

18:34.012 --> 18:37.175
...at this table.
Here in the middle.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.349
I'm having my lunch...

18:39.518 --> 18:43.386
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.556
If he'll sit with me.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.198
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.429
You know...

18:59.705 --> 19:03.141
...we work in a museum
of natural history.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.935
And yet, there is something...

19:06.145 --> 19:07.669
...unnatural...

19:08.881 --> 19:10.610
...about the way we eat lunch.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.180
Now, I want you to know...

19:14.319 --> 19:19.416
...it took a tour guide to show
this scientist the error of his ways.

19:19.691 --> 19:23.422
You might even say he took
me on a tour...

19:23.795 --> 19:26.025
...of myself.

19:27.399 --> 19:30.027
Yeah, that was me.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.901
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

19:35.107 --> 19:40.101
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.574
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

19:44.883 --> 19:47.852
Now, I say we shed these coats...

19:48.120 --> 19:49.747
...that separate us.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.952
And we get to know
the people underneath.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.254
I'm Ross!

19:58.931 --> 20:01.798
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

20:07.973 --> 20:10.373
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

20:11.109 --> 20:13.873
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

20:16.415 --> 20:21.546
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.722
-There you go!
-Hang in there, Teddy!

20:25.991 --> 20:27.424
I'm Andrew.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.393
And I didn't pay for this pear.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.328
Okay. Good for you.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.399
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

20:43.775 --> 20:45.538
Wow, Rhonda.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.241
-I'm Scott.
-Yeah, okay, Scott!

20:51.016 --> 20:54.747
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

20:54.886 --> 20:57.184
...or my family will die.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.053
My mom's gonna be here any minute.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.627
I can't. I can't give him up.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.460
Yes, no. I can.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.295
I don't want to.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.401
But I can.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.865
No.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.474
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.769
You know, I never saw that.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.107
Oh, it was only okay.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.247
I can't do this.

21:27.986 --> 21:31.615
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

21:31.890 --> 21:34.120
...there's no way
I can give up a baby.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.390
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

21:38.597 --> 21:42.226
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

21:46.438 --> 21:48.303
We were in the neighborhood.

21:48.607 --> 21:52.668
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

21:54.146 --> 21:58.583
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.343
Who's this little guy?

22:05.824 --> 22:09.760
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

22:12.631 --> 22:16.260
You are so precious,
I could take you home.

22:16.868 --> 22:17.892
Why don't you?

22:18.603 --> 22:20.969
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.108
Thanks.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.045
-What are you doing?
-I'm okay with this.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.712
You know why?
Because look at them.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.713
Look how happy they are.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.886
And I made that, so you know....

22:39.324 --> 22:43.351
It'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby, but oh, my God!

22:43.628 --> 22:46.358
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

22:47.999 --> 22:50.729
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.402
Thank you so much!

22:57.976 --> 23:00.410
You don't know what this means to us.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.307
I think I'm going to cry!

23:09.755 --> 23:11.689
It's going to be so great.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.422
-What's going on?
-I gave them the puppy.

23:17.696 --> 23:21.564
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.100
-Phoebe
-No, I know.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.997
We're different, though.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.502
This is a different situation.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.174
I am not going to regret this.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.235
I understand all that.

23:34.613 --> 23:38.208
It's just, that was my puppy.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.250
Would you ever be a surrogate?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.053
Depends who asked.

23:46.758 --> 23:47.986
What if I asked?

23:48.560 --> 23:50.721
Oh, Mon, sure!

23:50.996 --> 23:53.260
-Really?
-Yes.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.902
You're not asking me, are you?

23:59.037 --> 24:01.528
-No.
-Yes. Totally.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.372
Thank you! Thank you!

24:08.980 --> 24:12.006
Thank you!
Yes, thank you!
