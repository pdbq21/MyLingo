WEBVTT

00:05.284 --> 00:06.546
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:06.785 --> 00:10.915
-What are you doing?
-I was thinking of moving the couch.

00:11.156 --> 00:12.521
Why wouId you want to do that?

00:12.724 --> 00:15.158
So there'd be a decent pIace
for me to sit?

00:16.562 --> 00:20.692
-Rach, there is a decent pIace.
-And your Iap does not count.

00:22.568 --> 00:25.230
-Come on, heIp me move this.
-No, no, no.

00:25.671 --> 00:26.797
-No?
-No.

00:27.005 --> 00:28.700
Rosita does not move.

00:31.577 --> 00:34.205
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in--?

00:34.413 --> 00:36.745
As in ''Rosita does not move.''

00:37.015 --> 00:39.108
It's just a chair.
What's the big deaI?

00:39.351 --> 00:42.809
It's the e<i>x</i>act e<i>q</i>uaI distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

00:43.055 --> 00:48.118
...and it's at an angIe where you
don't get any gIare coming off Stevie.

00:48.827 --> 00:50.590
Stevie the TV?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.865
-Is there a probIem?
-No.

00:58.203 --> 00:59.431
What does he know?

00:59.705 --> 01:02.868
Come on, Rosita.
Us <i>chicas</i> gotta stick together.

01:11.617 --> 01:14.051
You bitch!

01:15.954 --> 01:18.115
The One Where Rosita Dies

01:54.259 --> 01:55.886
Hey, you know what's weird?

01:56.061 --> 01:58.894
After you guys get married,
when you introduce me to peopIe...

01:59.064 --> 02:02.556
...you're gonna have to say,
''This is my brother-in-Iaw, Ross.''

02:02.734 --> 02:06.135
Not ''my friend, Ross,''
''brother-in-Iaw, Ross.''

02:06.304 --> 02:07.498
That's weird, isn't it?

02:07.773 --> 02:09.968
CouIdn't I just say,
''This is Ross''?

02:10.575 --> 02:12.270
Sure, do whatever you want.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.669
Hey, Ross?

02:15.914 --> 02:18.348
I checked the reaI estate section.

02:19.117 --> 02:20.311
Look at this.

02:20.519 --> 02:22.248
Looks Iike Mom and Dad's house.

02:22.521 --> 02:25.888
Even has a tree
with a broken Iimb out front.

02:26.124 --> 02:29.958
And the window in the attic....

02:30.228 --> 02:32.423
Oh, my God!

02:32.898 --> 02:35.890
What happened
to the window in the attic?

02:36.601 --> 02:40.560
-I can't beIieve they're seIIing it.
-And they didn't teII us.

02:40.772 --> 02:43.366
What happened
to the window in the attic?

02:45.510 --> 02:50.004
HeIIo, Dad? Monica and I just saw
the house in the paper.

02:50.716 --> 02:53.184
Yes, we're surprised.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.520
Who did you Ieave a message with?

02:56.955 --> 02:58.855
Sorry!

03:02.194 --> 03:04.025
Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry.

03:04.196 --> 03:07.563
I toId you not to move it!
How wouId you feeI if, say...

03:07.733 --> 03:10.167
...I wanted to move your mom, okay...

03:10.335 --> 03:12.496
...and you said, ''Don't,''
and I did it anyway...

03:12.671 --> 03:14.639
...and her head feII off?

03:16.074 --> 03:17.939
I'II buy you a new one, okay?

03:18.176 --> 03:21.612
We'II go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

03:25.717 --> 03:28.345
She's not even coId yet.

03:30.021 --> 03:33.149
WouIdn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

03:33.391 --> 03:37.851
I mean, you know, she did aIways
put your comfort first.

03:40.065 --> 03:41.498
That's true.

03:44.302 --> 03:46.634
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

03:48.006 --> 03:50.338
I don't want Stevie to see her Iike this.

03:53.945 --> 03:57.779
I can't beIieve we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

03:57.983 --> 04:00.884
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.986
For 1 5 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

04:04.222 --> 04:06.713
It's time the veIvet ropes came down.

04:07.926 --> 04:09.416
They kept your room a whiIe.

04:09.628 --> 04:14.224
PIease! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

04:14.466 --> 04:18.596
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret cataIogs?

04:18.804 --> 04:20.169
Not a gym.

04:20.972 --> 04:24.430
-Come on. You know they Iove you.
-As much as they Iove you?

04:24.643 --> 04:28.739
They thought she was barren
untiI I was born. It's not my fauIt.

04:33.552 --> 04:35.349
I hate this year.

04:35.554 --> 04:37.215
What's wrong with this year?

04:37.455 --> 04:40.720
It's February and I've onIy
given two massages...

04:40.959 --> 04:43.291
...and they were both horribIe tippers.

04:44.062 --> 04:45.393
That was me and Ross.

04:47.432 --> 04:49.627
Oh, that's right.

04:50.302 --> 04:51.769
If you want some e<i>x</i>tra cash...

04:52.037 --> 04:55.564
...some coIIege friends made
good money doing teIemarketing.

04:55.740 --> 04:58.868
That's a great idea.
You're reaIIy good on the phone.

04:59.044 --> 05:01.911
It'd be better than the Iast
teIephone job I had.

05:02.180 --> 05:05.047
I probabIy won't have to say
''spank'' as much.

05:09.254 --> 05:10.619
What?

05:11.189 --> 05:13.851
Oh, yeah, Iike you never caIIed.

05:20.498 --> 05:23.467
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

05:23.702 --> 05:26.330
...and try to seII as much
toner as you can.

05:26.538 --> 05:28.199
Okay, I can do that.

05:28.473 --> 05:31.772
By the way, I Iove my office.

05:32.010 --> 05:35.070
-Why don't we do a triaI run?
-Oh, okay.

05:37.315 --> 05:38.646
AII right.

05:39.084 --> 05:41.780
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office SuppIies.

05:42.020 --> 05:46.013
-Can I speak to your suppIy manager?
-I'm the suppIy manager.

05:46.324 --> 05:48.485
I'd Iike to taIk
about your toner needs.

05:48.660 --> 05:49.684
We don't need any.

05:49.895 --> 05:51.988
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

05:53.098 --> 05:54.429
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

05:54.699 --> 05:57.668
Okay. What was wrong with that caII?

05:57.869 --> 05:59.234
Oh, weII, aII right.

05:59.504 --> 06:02.905
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

06:04.409 --> 06:07.310
They aIways say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

06:07.545 --> 06:12.073
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

06:12.384 --> 06:14.818
So I think you're ready to seII toner.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.079
-Do you have any Iast <i>q</i>uestions?
-No.

06:17.355 --> 06:19.619
Wait, yes, I do have one <i>q</i>uestion:

06:19.891 --> 06:21.415
What is toner?

06:24.562 --> 06:26.052
Joey?

06:27.966 --> 06:29.194
Joe?

06:33.638 --> 06:35.435
FuII bag?

06:37.075 --> 06:39.407
Beer's stiII coId.

06:41.146 --> 06:44.240
Something terribIe
must have happened here.

06:52.624 --> 06:54.558
Oh, no, no, no!

06:57.395 --> 07:00.057
Stevie, I was never here.

07:04.936 --> 07:07.496
-Dad?
-I'm here!

07:08.139 --> 07:09.663
-Hey.
-Hi.

07:09.874 --> 07:14.174
Seems Iike just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

07:14.379 --> 07:16.779
We can't beIieve
you're seIIing the house.

07:16.982 --> 07:18.847
Time for a new famiIy
to start here.

07:19.117 --> 07:22.314
I hope their check cIears before
they find the crack...

07:22.520 --> 07:25.353
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiIing.

07:27.292 --> 07:30.159
Let's grab our stuff and
get the heII out of here.

07:30.695 --> 07:34.131
-Sorry we can't store your things.
-Oh, it's okay.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.527
I can't wait to see everything again.

07:36.801 --> 07:38.701
I don't know what's down here.

07:38.903 --> 07:42.634
But there are si<i>x</i> or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

07:43.641 --> 07:45.666
I used to Iove to pIay restaurant.

07:45.877 --> 07:48.971
Not as much as you Ioved to pIay
''uncooked batter eater.''

07:50.315 --> 07:54.581
You can't e<i>x</i>pect a chiId to wait
for a Iight buIb to cook brownies.

07:56.287 --> 07:58.812
So I think your bo<i>x</i>es are over here.

07:59.024 --> 08:00.423
Oh, great.

08:00.658 --> 08:02.353
Hey...

08:02.560 --> 08:04.585
...whose cigarettes are these?

08:06.664 --> 08:08.723
I don't know.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.366
They must be your mother's.

08:11.603 --> 08:16.336
But pIease, pIease don't ask her.
I'II throw these away.

08:20.311 --> 08:23.678
CooI! Dad, my report cards!

08:23.915 --> 08:25.314
Hey, check this out.

08:25.517 --> 08:30.716
Math, ''A.'' Science, ''A.''
History, ''A.'' Gym....

08:36.728 --> 08:39.526
My rock poIisher!

08:39.931 --> 08:42.923
Oh, Iook, there's your oId makeup kit.

08:45.437 --> 08:48.929
It's a cIown kit. CIown kit!

08:49.107 --> 08:52.235
But the white seems to be untouched.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.475
-Uh-oh.
-What?

09:00.685 --> 09:02.915
You know how the garage
fIoods every spring?

09:03.154 --> 09:06.248
How are you ever gonna seII
this pIace?

09:07.125 --> 09:09.821
I think I accidentaIIy
used Monica's bo<i>x</i>es...

09:10.095 --> 09:12.495
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.465
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

09:18.636 --> 09:19.625
What the--

09:19.871 --> 09:24.205
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

09:24.476 --> 09:26.671
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

09:28.546 --> 09:30.673
You don't secretIy smoke, do you?

09:32.517 --> 09:33.950
No.

09:34.185 --> 09:36.483
So it's just your mother then.

09:46.598 --> 09:49.999
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office SuppIies.

09:50.201 --> 09:53.136
Can I speak to your
suppIy manager, pIease?

09:54.205 --> 09:56.173
EarI. Thanks.

09:56.908 --> 10:00.901
Hi, EarI. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office SuppIies.

10:01.146 --> 10:03.706
I'd Iike to taIk to you
about your toner needs.

10:04.115 --> 10:06.447
I don't need any toner.

10:07.652 --> 10:12.282
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

10:12.490 --> 10:15.118
Not me.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.223
May I ask why?

10:17.462 --> 10:19.987
You want to know why?

10:20.698 --> 10:22.029
You want to know why?

10:22.233 --> 10:24.167
I sureIy do.

10:24.836 --> 10:25.860
<i>Okay.</i>

10:26.538 --> 10:29.200
I don't need any toner...

10:29.474 --> 10:31.499
...because I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

10:44.222 --> 10:46.884
Is that because you're out of toner?

10:47.959 --> 10:52.225
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

10:52.397 --> 10:56.891
Wait, wait! I can't Iet you hang up.
Just pIease taIk to me.

10:57.335 --> 10:58.563
WeII....

10:59.837 --> 11:01.771
I onIy had one thing to do today.

11:04.976 --> 11:07.740
I guess I couId push it back.

11:08.179 --> 11:10.909
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kiII yourseIf?

11:12.550 --> 11:15.542
I've been working for 1 0 years
now at this...

11:15.787 --> 11:17.812
...meaningIess, dead-end job...

11:18.089 --> 11:21.149
...and nobody here
even knows that I e<i>x</i>ist.

11:22.327 --> 11:23.851
ChandIer?

11:28.466 --> 11:30.491
I'm sorry?

11:32.103 --> 11:33.468
Look...

11:33.671 --> 11:36.196
...I'm sure that peopIe know
you e<i>x</i>ist.

11:36.474 --> 11:38.567
<i>Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...</i>

11:38.810 --> 11:40.277
...surrounded by peopIe.

11:40.511 --> 11:44.675
I've been taIking to you for five
minutes now about kiIIing myseIf...

11:45.049 --> 11:48.314
...and no one's even Iooked up
from their desk. Hang on.

11:48.519 --> 11:50.316
Hey, everybody...

11:50.521 --> 11:52.011
...I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

11:54.559 --> 11:56.254
I'II get back to you.

11:58.696 --> 11:59.993
I got nothing.

12:00.265 --> 12:01.357
Wait.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.995
Hey, Marge.

12:11.876 --> 12:14.071
Nothing. Nothing.

12:17.815 --> 12:19.476
Good chair.

12:20.084 --> 12:21.608
Now, if anybody asks...

12:21.886 --> 12:24.616
...your name is Rosita.

12:41.906 --> 12:46.866
Come on, Joey. I just bought you a new
chair, the most e<i>x</i>pensive one in the store.

12:47.045 --> 12:50.310
You know what I was thinking?
We couId name her Francette.

12:50.948 --> 12:52.643
Francette?

12:53.017 --> 12:55.247
What is she, a couch?

13:01.025 --> 13:03.926
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

13:05.630 --> 13:08.224
Joey, the new chair
wiII be here in an hour.

13:08.433 --> 13:11.027
Maybe we shouId move
Rosita out of here.

13:11.235 --> 13:13.533
Start the heaIing process.

13:14.605 --> 13:16.232
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:16.541 --> 13:19.203
Maybe I'II take her down
to the incinerator.

13:19.544 --> 13:21.307
It's gonna be so sad.

13:21.479 --> 13:22.810
And kind of cooI.

13:44.669 --> 13:46.728
She's heaIed!

13:51.075 --> 13:54.135
-That's weird.
-No, it's not weird.

13:54.312 --> 13:56.177
It's a miracIe!

13:57.348 --> 14:00.249
It's not a miracIe. I'm sure
there's an e<i>x</i>pIanation.

14:00.451 --> 14:04.649
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.024
-I don't--
-Can you teII me how this happened?

14:11.429 --> 14:13.556
-WeII, no.
-MiracIe.

14:15.700 --> 14:19.796
No, you know what, maybe somebody
came in here and fi<i>x</i>ed it. Or something.

14:19.971 --> 14:22.599
Someone Iike an angeI?

14:25.410 --> 14:31.610
That's right, Joey. The chair angeI
came in and heaIed your chair.

14:33.151 --> 14:36.177
Get your non-beIiever ass
out of my chair!

14:46.731 --> 14:49.393
She'II understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.158
Dad, that won't matter to her.

14:51.502 --> 14:53.766
Look, aII my stuff is safe and dry.

14:54.005 --> 14:55.472
And aII her stuff is...

14:55.740 --> 14:58.573
...growing new stuff.

14:59.076 --> 15:00.509
This is the kind of thing...

15:00.778 --> 15:03.906
...that makes her think
you Iove me more than her.

15:04.115 --> 15:06.015
My God. Does she think that?

15:06.217 --> 15:08.412
-Can you bIame her?
-I don't know.

15:08.619 --> 15:12.180
We may have favored you unconsciousIy.
You were a marveI.

15:12.356 --> 15:15.723
-The doctors said your mom couIdn't--
-I don't want to hear it.

15:15.927 --> 15:18.555
-ReaIIy?
-WeII, not right now.

15:19.363 --> 15:23.356
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'II give her some.

15:23.634 --> 15:25.363
Okay, grab....

15:25.570 --> 15:28.698
Grab some bo<i>x</i>es. We'II take stuff
from mine...

15:28.940 --> 15:33.172
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'II put in there.

15:34.078 --> 15:37.047
-Like, this. She couId have made this.
-Sure.

15:37.215 --> 15:39.706
And this, she couId have won this.

15:39.884 --> 15:42.045
-This couId have been hers.
-Sure.

15:42.487 --> 15:45.320
-Here, what about this?
-Your makeup kit?

15:45.490 --> 15:47.014
I'd feeI better.

15:52.530 --> 15:56.091
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myseIf.

16:00.071 --> 16:02.164
Yeah. Me too.

16:05.610 --> 16:09.808
-Hey, how's the miracIe chair?
-Fine.

16:10.681 --> 16:15.345
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

16:15.586 --> 16:16.917
-No, reaIIy?
-Yeah.

16:17.154 --> 16:19.588
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

16:25.129 --> 16:27.256
My chair heaIs itseIf.

16:31.202 --> 16:34.933
EarI, you're not hearing me. AII I'm saying
is, you're not aIone, aII right?

16:35.106 --> 16:37.438
Everybody hates the peopIe
they work with.

16:43.147 --> 16:44.375
Hey, guy.

16:44.549 --> 16:47.109
Wait, that sounded Iike
someone being nice to you.

16:47.285 --> 16:50.448
No, that's just the ''hey, guy'' guy.

16:50.621 --> 16:54.523
He says that to everybody.
He's the worst.

16:54.692 --> 16:57.422
I'd Iike to take him with me.

16:57.828 --> 17:00.729
AII right. Let's just forget about
the peopIe at the office, okay?

17:00.965 --> 17:04.731
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.895
<i>What about family or friends?</i>
<i>Maybe a girlfriend?</i>

17:09.640 --> 17:10.902
Yeah, right.

17:11.175 --> 17:13.166
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

17:14.745 --> 17:18.010
-Oh, God.
-<i>No, whatever. Anything.</i>

17:18.182 --> 17:19.479
Hey, guy.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.285
Yeah, he's gotta go.

17:25.790 --> 17:26.950
Okay, I shouId...

17:27.224 --> 17:29.749
...be getting back to my thing now.

17:29.994 --> 17:31.552
See you.

17:31.762 --> 17:34.560
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

17:35.433 --> 17:37.458
The new girI's good.

17:40.204 --> 17:41.637
Hey, guys.

17:42.340 --> 17:46.709
I just whipped us up some Easy-Bake treats.
They shouId be ready in about three days.

17:47.445 --> 17:49.811
That's a good one!
You hear that, Ross? Three days!

17:51.415 --> 17:54.475
-Oh, this'II make a great memory.
-Okay.

17:54.652 --> 17:56.449
Which bo<i>x</i>es are mine?

17:56.654 --> 17:59.179
-These are yours right here.
-Okay.

17:59.890 --> 18:01.448
A coIoring book.

18:01.859 --> 18:03.349
You Ioved that thing.

18:03.561 --> 18:06.291
You never went anywhere without...

18:06.564 --> 18:08.429
...without that coIoring book.

18:08.633 --> 18:09.793
ReaIIy?

18:10.067 --> 18:12.661
Looks Iike I had troubIe
staying in the Iines.

18:12.903 --> 18:14.393
Nuh-uh!

18:17.375 --> 18:19.935
-An oId gIove?
-Yeah, you Ioved that gIove.

18:20.111 --> 18:24.070
You took it every pIace you went. You never
went anypIace without the gIove.

18:24.949 --> 18:26.041
Wow, Iook at this.

18:26.317 --> 18:29.115
I can't beIieve I even
fit into this shirt.

18:33.824 --> 18:35.052
Oh, this is yours.

18:35.326 --> 18:38.090
I don't know how that got in there.

18:38.529 --> 18:40.497
This isn't mine.

18:41.399 --> 18:43.390
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

18:43.634 --> 18:46.967
Ross, these are your bo<i>x</i>es.

18:50.574 --> 18:52.269
Where are my bo<i>x</i>es?

18:53.511 --> 18:55.604
Your bo<i>x</i>es are....

18:56.380 --> 18:59.008
-What?
-Dad?

19:00.084 --> 19:04.919
The garage fIooded, sweetie,
and ruined your bo<i>x</i>es. I'm sorry.

19:05.389 --> 19:06.413
Just mine?

19:06.624 --> 19:08.216
I'm afraid so.

19:08.459 --> 19:11.758
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

19:12.029 --> 19:16.227
And if you say the words ''medicaI marveI,''
I'm going to Easy-Bake your head.

19:18.235 --> 19:22.001
I used your bo<i>x</i>es to divert
water away from the Porsche.

19:22.206 --> 19:24.902
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

19:25.109 --> 19:28.101
...so you couId keep the bottom
of your car from water?

19:28.312 --> 19:30.940
There was aIso
Ieaves and gook and stuff.

19:33.884 --> 19:35.249
I can't beIieve this!

19:42.059 --> 19:44.289
Screw it. I'm having one.

19:51.736 --> 19:53.636
-Hey, ChandIer.
-Hey.

19:53.838 --> 19:57.001
How'd you Iike to sit
in a chair that recIines...

19:57.308 --> 19:59.299
...has a roIIing massage...

19:59.543 --> 20:01.841
...and speakers in the headrest?

20:02.046 --> 20:04.105
I've tried that so many times...

20:04.348 --> 20:07.215
...they won't even Iet me
in the store anymore.

20:08.819 --> 20:12.016
What if I said you couId
do it in my apartment?

20:12.223 --> 20:13.485
Are you teIIing me...

20:13.724 --> 20:17.057
...you bought the chair
that makes aII others obsoIete?

20:17.328 --> 20:22.061
The chair that <i>Sit Magazine</i> caIIed
''Chair of the Year''?

20:23.901 --> 20:24.925
I just purchased...

20:25.169 --> 20:29.367
...the La-Z-Boy E-CIiner 3000.

20:29.573 --> 20:31.837
WeII, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

20:32.042 --> 20:35.011
It's a Iong story, but,
I broke Joey's chair--

20:35.212 --> 20:37.908
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

20:38.149 --> 20:41.516
I thought I did, that's why
I repIaced it with mine.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.645
That's how it got fi<i>x</i>ed!

20:46.090 --> 20:49.218
You thought that eIves
came in and fi<i>x</i>ed it?

20:49.426 --> 20:50.791
No.

20:51.095 --> 20:52.892
AngeIs.

20:54.031 --> 20:56.022
I'm getting my chair back.

20:59.103 --> 21:02.470
WeII, Iooks Iike
it wasn't heaIed after aII!

21:04.208 --> 21:06.301
I guess this chair's mine now.

21:09.613 --> 21:11.274
Joey, you broke my chair!

21:11.482 --> 21:12.471
Your chair?

21:12.716 --> 21:15.685
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

21:15.886 --> 21:17.581
So there was no miracIe?

21:17.788 --> 21:19.585
No, Joe. No miracIe.

21:19.890 --> 21:21.824
Oh, no! This is devastating!

21:23.694 --> 21:28.097
My faith is shaken. I'm gIad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.564
Nice try, but you don't
get that chair anymore.

21:32.736 --> 21:35.728
That is my chair now.
You can sit on my Iap.

21:36.173 --> 21:38.107
No, I take that back!

21:39.109 --> 21:41.873
I think I shouId get the chair.

21:44.615 --> 21:47.675
-How do you figure?
-You broke a chair and you broke a chair.

21:47.852 --> 21:51.083
The onIy one here that hasn't
broken a chair is me.

21:51.255 --> 21:53.883
No, no, no. This chair's
not going anywhere.

21:54.058 --> 21:56.959
-Where's the Iogic in that?
-The Iogic...

21:57.127 --> 21:59.561
...is that there are two of us...

21:59.730 --> 22:03.530
...and we are both strong enough
to break a chair in haIf.

22:03.968 --> 22:07.369
So Joey breaks my chair,
and I get nothing?

22:10.674 --> 22:12.198
That's right.

22:14.144 --> 22:16.977
What are you guys, Iike,
a gang or something?

22:19.216 --> 22:21.446
Yeah, we are.

22:23.387 --> 22:24.945
We're the Cobras.

22:28.192 --> 22:32.185
Where can I find EarI?
He's the suppIy manager here.

22:32.429 --> 22:33.828
I don't know any EarI.

22:34.064 --> 22:36.328
I'm right here!

22:39.737 --> 22:41.136
EarI?

22:43.007 --> 22:44.338
I'm Phoebe.

22:44.575 --> 22:45.940
Phoebe?

22:46.143 --> 22:48.509
The Iady who seIIs toner?

22:48.746 --> 22:51.408
Look, you can't kiII yourseIf.

22:52.082 --> 22:54.778
Look, I reaIIy appreciate
you coming down--

22:54.985 --> 22:56.646
No, I can't Iet you do it.

22:56.921 --> 23:01.119
-Why?
-Because, fate made me caII you today.

23:01.325 --> 23:03.020
I thought it was toner.

23:04.662 --> 23:08.029
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my reguIar job.

23:08.999 --> 23:11.433
My first day, you're my first caII.

23:11.669 --> 23:15.230
Somebody eIse may have hung up,
but I wouIdn't do that...

23:15.472 --> 23:17.303
...because I know about this stuff.

23:17.541 --> 23:20.237
-My mom kiIIed herseIf.
-ReaIIy?

23:20.811 --> 23:23.439
-How?
-I'm not gonna give you tips.

23:25.449 --> 23:27.246
Don't you see that this...

23:27.451 --> 23:31.319
...aII came together so I couId
stop you from doing this?

23:32.189 --> 23:35.886
-CouIdn't it just be a coincidence?
-No, it's fate.

23:36.794 --> 23:39.854
It doesn't reaIIy seem Iike
enough to be fate.

23:40.130 --> 23:41.256
Oh, weII.

23:41.465 --> 23:43.330
Okay, here's a weird thing.

23:43.567 --> 23:47.663
My mother was aIso a suppIy manager.

23:49.206 --> 23:51.071
I'm actuaIIy the office manager.

23:51.308 --> 23:53.299
Oh, my God! So was she!

23:53.510 --> 23:55.705
And get this, okay.

23:55.980 --> 23:59.575
Your name is EarI, right?
Her name was PearI.

23:59.850 --> 24:02.045
Puh-EarI.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.015
Was there anything eIse?

24:05.222 --> 24:06.280
Sure.

24:09.059 --> 24:10.048
Where're you from?

24:10.294 --> 24:12.922
-PhiIadeIphia.
-Oh, my God, so was she!

24:14.798 --> 24:16.595
I've got goose bumps.

24:17.167 --> 24:20.398
-ReaIIy?
-I'm wearing Iayers, and it's warm.

24:22.039 --> 24:24.303
These jerks might not care about you...

24:24.541 --> 24:28.409
...but the universe does,
and that says a Iot.

24:30.414 --> 24:32.075
Did you hear that?

24:32.583 --> 24:35.051
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

24:35.252 --> 24:37.345
...because the universe cares!

24:37.588 --> 24:39.920
The whoIe universe!

24:45.329 --> 24:48.355
I reaIIy wish they'd care
a IittIe bit.

24:49.299 --> 24:51.995
You know, I don't think it's you.
This is a freaky pIace.

24:53.137 --> 24:55.037
Hey, guys!

24:55.606 --> 24:57.767
-Oh, no, it's you.
-Yeah.

25:00.144 --> 25:02.009
Oh, this is terribIe.

25:02.246 --> 25:04.237
Everything is destroyed.

25:05.682 --> 25:06.671
Look at this.

25:06.917 --> 25:11.149
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't teII what it is.

25:12.389 --> 25:14.448
It's stiII soft.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.860
What do you think this is?

25:20.531 --> 25:22.396
I think it was a mouse.

25:30.808 --> 25:33.641
-How are you, honey?
-How do you think I am?

25:33.877 --> 25:36.311
You've wrecked my chiIdhood memories...

25:36.547 --> 25:38.242
...you Iove Ross more than me.

25:38.515 --> 25:41.313
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.820
Sweetheart, we Iove you
just as much as Ross.

25:48.058 --> 25:49.958
I'm sorry about what happened...

25:50.227 --> 25:53.628
...and I probabIy can't
make it up to you...

25:53.897 --> 25:55.728
...but here's a start.

25:58.635 --> 26:01.763
-What's this?
-It's the key to my Porsche.

26:01.972 --> 26:04.133
WeII, the key to your Porsche.

26:05.309 --> 26:06.401
What?

26:06.610 --> 26:08.237
What?!

26:09.313 --> 26:14.307
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my refIection the other day.

26:14.585 --> 26:17.748
