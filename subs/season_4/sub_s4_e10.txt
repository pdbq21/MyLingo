WEBVTT

00:04.804 --> 00:06.704
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

00:06.906 --> 00:09.568
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

00:10.977 --> 00:11.966
Fifteen?

00:12.212 --> 00:14.146
Your personal best!

00:19.052 --> 00:20.417
Where were you?

00:20.653 --> 00:21.642
On a date.

00:21.821 --> 00:24.346
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.490
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?

00:27.894 --> 00:29.794
No. Answer his.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.892
We were at the back of the train.

00:33.133 --> 00:36.466
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

00:36.736 --> 00:40.638
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

00:40.907 --> 00:44.172
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

00:44.577 --> 00:46.943
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

00:47.147 --> 00:50.548
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

00:50.817 --> 00:54.184
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie?

00:55.422 --> 00:57.720
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.692
Done! I did it.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.359
Who's stupid now?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.892
The One with the
Girl From Poughkeepsie

01:53.279 --> 01:56.112
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.316
That paper is two weeks old.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.951
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

02:05.558 --> 02:08.220
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

02:08.428 --> 02:11.556
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.995
I hate being alone
this time of year.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.332
Next it's Valentine's Day...

02:16.569 --> 02:18.503
...then my birthday, then bang!

02:18.771 --> 02:22.070
Before you know it, they're
lighting that damn tree again.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.243
I want somebody!

02:28.314 --> 02:30.976
You know, I want a man!

02:35.788 --> 02:40.122
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

02:40.326 --> 02:43.454
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.656
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.366
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

02:55.108 --> 02:58.805
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

02:59.279 --> 03:03.477
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

03:03.716 --> 03:06.344
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

03:06.853 --> 03:11.222
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.026
Okay.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.353
No accountants.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.895
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.657
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.206
What's wrong, Mon?

03:28.508 --> 03:30.271
Everybody at work still hates me.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.846
Is it because of the review
you wrote or something new?

03:34.614 --> 03:36.639
It's the review.

03:37.183 --> 03:38.343
I was making headway.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.782
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

03:42.021 --> 03:45.184
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

03:48.928 --> 03:52.955
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

03:58.137 --> 04:00.230
What's the matter?

04:00.673 --> 04:02.573
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.979
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.947
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.955
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.356
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.393
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

04:28.835 --> 04:33.204
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.667
You know what you can do?

04:34.941 --> 04:38.138
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

04:38.444 --> 04:42.380
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

04:42.682 --> 04:45.310
Then they would all know who was boss.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.821
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.449
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

04:54.694 --> 04:56.491
Good enough to get fired.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.259
All right. You're hired!

05:01.768 --> 05:06.762
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.445
Yes.

05:23.122 --> 05:26.114
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

05:26.659 --> 05:28.354
I'm not asking for me.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.294
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.159
I'm not gay.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.601
I didn't think you were gay.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.327
I do now.

05:40.973 --> 05:43.703
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.544
I just got out of
a big relationship.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.679
I'm not looking to get serious.

05:48.948 --> 05:52.281
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

05:52.485 --> 05:56.888
Is this "Hot Rachel" that
you took to the Christmas Party?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.622
By the way, that is her full name.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.954
Wow! I'm free for her.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.629
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.656
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.065
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.738
I'll bring them
by your office at five.

06:14.707 --> 06:18.871
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

06:19.078 --> 06:23.014
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

06:23.683 --> 06:28.677
I don't know what that is,
but that's a pretty nice jacket.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.422
Kind of like that tie too.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.397
Keep your pants on, man.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.943
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

06:56.249 --> 06:59.480
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

07:01.521 --> 07:04.649
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

07:05.291 --> 07:07.759
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

07:08.027 --> 07:11.292
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

07:15.001 --> 07:16.525
Pheebs, that's great!

07:16.769 --> 07:20.671
But you know,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.711
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

07:26.312 --> 07:29.213
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

07:29.482 --> 07:33.782
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.453
Maypole.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.552
All good. Thanks.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.988
Do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.528
Didn't your dad used to call you
"Pumpkin"?

07:46.766 --> 07:50.293
Pumpkin? But did he ever
call you "Budolph"?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.467
Hello, children.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.143
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

08:00.079 --> 08:02.980
-Really?
-I showed them your picture.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.185
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.182
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?

08:08.421 --> 08:10.321
Wherever! I've got 20.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.417
Will I like any of these guys?

08:14.694 --> 08:16.594
You know, I'm going to...

08:16.829 --> 08:19.229
...play the field a little bit more.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.598
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.936
You work with robots?

08:31.143 --> 08:32.872
Yes.

08:33.913 --> 08:38.247
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.213
I like swimmers' bodies.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.217
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.990
I like credit cards!

08:46.692 --> 08:48.284
I'm not bad at this!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.053
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.

08:51.397 --> 08:55.731
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company....

08:55.968 --> 08:59.062
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

09:00.806 --> 09:03.900
No, the robots just work for them.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.168
All right, I'm going to work.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.714
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

09:10.016 --> 09:12.075
Yeah, lady. I do!

09:12.318 --> 09:13.376
I got a problem!

09:13.619 --> 09:15.712
I'll give you a problem!

09:16.289 --> 09:17.984
What will you do?
Fire me?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.658
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

09:20.927 --> 09:23.293
-See you later.
-Thanks.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.733
I should go.
I've got a date.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.163
With who?

09:32.371 --> 09:35.340
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

09:35.508 --> 09:36.907
Not her.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.407
This is someone else.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.080
I can't decide between the two.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.749
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

09:46.986 --> 09:49.454
...really smart and a lot of fun.

09:49.655 --> 09:53.614
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.093
She's just as pretty.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.095
I guess she's smart.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.492
She's not fun.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.238
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

10:07.506 --> 10:11.237
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

10:11.911 --> 10:16.109
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

10:16.582 --> 10:19.415
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

10:19.819 --> 10:24.654
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.854
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

10:32.098 --> 10:33.929
Damn!

10:42.475 --> 10:44.534
What happened to your fancy jacket?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.437
They baked it.

10:46.879 --> 10:47.971
I can't take this anymore.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.876
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.517
What are you doing?

10:53.686 --> 10:55.813
You're still on fire there.

10:57.523 --> 10:59.388
I think you got it!

11:03.929 --> 11:07.365
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.661
Like father, like son.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.571
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

11:14.840 --> 11:17.104
This could, maybe, get serious.

11:17.576 --> 11:21.342
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

11:21.580 --> 11:24.208
Well, you know, possibly.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.949
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

11:34.260 --> 11:37.787
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.362
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?

11:40.566 --> 11:42.796
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl

11:43.035 --> 11:44.059
I see.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.034
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

11:49.275 --> 11:52.142
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

11:56.582 --> 11:58.607
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.481
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

12:02.788 --> 12:06.155
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.383
Hey, Dragon!

12:09.295 --> 12:12.594
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.564
There's $300 in this one.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.235
People get generous
around the holidays.

12:18.437 --> 12:21.804
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.245
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

12:27.446 --> 12:31.314
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish

12:32.084 --> 12:33.551
Why is nobody writing these?

12:33.786 --> 12:35.083
We can remember them.

12:35.387 --> 12:39.483
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

12:39.725 --> 12:42.387
Sure, that too.

12:43.829 --> 12:48.163
Forget the specials for a minute.
Here's the thing....

12:49.668 --> 12:51.761
For the last two weeks I have...

12:52.838 --> 12:56.569
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.276
Can't hear you!

13:00.246 --> 13:02.077
Positive atmosphere.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.909
But I've had it up to here.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.649
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

13:12.424 --> 13:15.518
...or the highway. All right?

13:16.462 --> 13:19.295
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

13:28.007 --> 13:29.531
Hey, new guy.

13:30.176 --> 13:33.976
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

13:35.447 --> 13:37.108
No, ma'am.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.350
He has a name. It's Dragon.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.123
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.688
We did the hat, right?

13:50.229 --> 13:53.130
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.764
I was going to do it.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.562
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

13:58.804 --> 14:02.137
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

14:02.341 --> 14:04.775
...it's been a long time since I had...

14:06.178 --> 14:08.840
...$327 plus $238!

14:10.282 --> 14:13.945
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

14:14.320 --> 14:16.811
And I got to pay rent!

14:19.258 --> 14:20.953
How about you don't fire me.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.787
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

14:24.063 --> 14:27.328
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

14:28.767 --> 14:29.961
What nice things?

14:30.269 --> 14:33.727
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

14:34.573 --> 14:38.009
Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica
Merry, merry

14:38.244 --> 14:40.235
You know what, Pheebs?

14:41.347 --> 14:43.247
I'm not Jewish so....

14:43.782 --> 14:46.910
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

14:47.152 --> 14:49.143
...but he's not complaining.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.684
Bad dream?

14:55.427 --> 14:56.519
I wasn't sleeping.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.265
What was Phoebe's song about?

15:01.700 --> 15:04.362
It's the one with the cat.

15:05.971 --> 15:09.031
I got to go.
I've got another date.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.940
Did you pick one yet?

15:11.243 --> 15:15.111
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

15:15.714 --> 15:19.548
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.985
So I'm still torn.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.245
You don't like the one from uptown.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.254
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.322
Just end them both!

15:29.595 --> 15:32.257
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.295
Then break up with uptown.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.162
By the time you get home,
you're done!

15:38.504 --> 15:40.438
You're right. Thank you.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.738
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.804
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.789
Patrick just ended things with me.

16:06.031 --> 16:11.094
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.499
I did! I absolutely did!

16:13.939 --> 16:15.497
You idiot!

16:15.841 --> 16:18.071
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

16:18.844 --> 16:23.178
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.415
Now you scared him away!

16:25.617 --> 16:28.518
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

16:28.787 --> 16:31.813
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

16:32.691 --> 16:34.318
I know, I know!

16:34.526 --> 16:37.586
Now I'm right back where I started.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.330
This sucks!

16:39.531 --> 16:41.590
Being alone sucks!

16:42.301 --> 16:44.201
You'll meet somebody.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.335
You're a great catch!

16:46.605 --> 16:51.440
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.109
Really?

16:55.381 --> 16:57.849
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.010
It doesn't matter.

17:04.490 --> 17:08.688
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

17:09.628 --> 17:11.789
Cute guys in little shorts?

17:11.997 --> 17:13.328
Sure.

17:14.633 --> 17:19.366
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.096
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.232
Okay.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.578
Have you ever been with a woman?

17:31.016 --> 17:34.679
What? What is the matter with you?

17:34.920 --> 17:38.515
There is no good time
to ask that question.

17:42.027 --> 17:45.758
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

17:47.866 --> 17:51.324
Ross? Ross?

17:51.603 --> 17:53.332
Wake up!

18:02.314 --> 18:04.009
I need more swordfish.

18:05.317 --> 18:08.775
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.616
-You just did.
-I don't know what to tell you.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.327
Fine.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.003
Okay. Very funny.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.436
Let me out, please.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.968
Come on, I'm cold!

18:35.314 --> 18:38.215
And covered in marinara sauce!

18:38.584 --> 18:39.812
Let me out!

18:44.089 --> 18:46.284
You found that handle, did you?

18:48.260 --> 18:51.252
-It's not funny.
-Well, that's not true.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.730
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

18:56.935 --> 19:00.996
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

19:01.273 --> 19:03.969
If you want me
to quit this bad then

19:05.110 --> 19:06.099
Chef Geller?

19:06.945 --> 19:08.845
You know that speech you made?

19:09.314 --> 19:11.305
I got a problem with it!

19:14.019 --> 19:16.180
-You do?
-You bet I do!

19:17.156 --> 19:20.819
I just wasn't listening then,
that's all.

19:22.361 --> 19:26.354
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

19:27.366 --> 19:29.527
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

19:29.835 --> 19:33.635
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

19:33.972 --> 19:35.701
Get out!

19:38.911 --> 19:39.900
All right.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.742
Anybody else got a problem?

19:43.248 --> 19:45.273
How about you, chuckles?

19:45.751 --> 19:47.946
You think this is funny now?

19:49.621 --> 19:54.081
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

19:55.127 --> 19:56.822
No, it's really good.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.825
Take those salads to table four.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.827
And you, get the swordfish!

20:03.168 --> 20:04.499
And you!

20:04.836 --> 20:06.497
Get a haircut!

20:09.441 --> 20:14.242
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

20:17.149 --> 20:18.912
What?

20:22.988 --> 20:26.321
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.025
Now that I see them, I win!

20:34.533 --> 20:37.696
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

20:41.940 --> 20:43.669
Are we really in Montreal?

20:44.109 --> 20:45.269
Yes, we are.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.002
So coffee?

20:49.214 --> 20:50.704
Coffee sounds great.

20:53.385 --> 20:54.682
Wait.

20:54.886 --> 20:56.854
So you live in Montreal?

20:57.055 --> 21:00.718
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.858
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

21:07.065 --> 21:09.363
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

21:12.037 --> 21:16.235
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.743
Enough!

21:22.180 --> 21:24.705
Lean, lean, lean!

21:27.185 --> 21:30.484
So this is a very special holiday song...

21:30.622 --> 21:34.388
...that I wrote for some very
important people to me.

21:37.329 --> 21:40.457
Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap

21:40.699 --> 21:43.827
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

21:45.537 --> 21:48.995
Said all you need is
To write them a song

21:49.341 --> 21:53.175
Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

21:54.046 --> 21:56.480
No, don't sing along

21:57.182 --> 21:59.878
Monica, Monica

22:00.252 --> 22:03.346
Have a happy Hannukah

22:04.756 --> 22:07.224
Saw Santa Claus

22:07.492 --> 22:10.893
He said hello to Ross

22:12.097 --> 22:14.930
And please tell Joey

22:15.267 --> 22:18.498
Christmas will be snowy

22:20.038 --> 22:23.030
And Rachel and Chandler

22:28.347 --> 22:30.338
Happy holidays, everybody!
