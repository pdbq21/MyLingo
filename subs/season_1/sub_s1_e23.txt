WEBVTT

00:06.971 --> 00:10.202
She's having my baby,
and she's not here yet.

00:10.407 --> 00:13.274
-Has her water broken yet?
-I don't know.

00:13.510 --> 00:17.879
When we talked, she said she'd
already passed the mucous plug.

00:20.017 --> 00:22.110
Do we have to know about that?

00:22.686 --> 00:25.052
What'll you do
when you have a baby?

00:25.255 --> 00:28.656
I'll be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

00:28.926 --> 00:33.829
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

00:34.832 --> 00:37.926
She could be giving birth in the cab.

00:38.135 --> 00:41.468
Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction...

00:41.772 --> 00:45.936
...and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

00:46.143 --> 00:49.510
What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

00:49.713 --> 00:52.375
You have to pick your moments.

00:52.883 --> 00:54.214
Did I miss it?

00:54.418 --> 00:57.285
-She's not here yet.
-What's with the guitar?

00:57.488 --> 01:01.481
We might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

01:01.959 --> 01:05.486
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

01:05.763 --> 01:07.993
I got this,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

01:08.232 --> 01:12.396
You're having a baby.
You don't stop for Chunkies.

01:12.703 --> 01:15.536
I used to have that bumper sticker.

01:16.173 --> 01:18.403
You see what I mean?

01:18.943 --> 01:21.173
The One With the Birth

02:05.355 --> 02:08.756
-"Stopped for a Chunky."
-Let it go, Ross.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.984
I got an extra one.
You want this?

02:14.998 --> 02:18.695
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau.

02:18.902 --> 02:21.871
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

02:22.072 --> 02:26.008
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

02:26.677 --> 02:29.669
-How are your contractions?
-I love them.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.316
Each one's like a little party
in my uterus.

02:33.517 --> 02:37.783
-Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds.
-59 seconds. Quartz.

02:38.789 --> 02:39.983
Swiss quartz.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.284
-Am I allowed to drink anything?
-Ice chips.

02:45.496 --> 02:48.021
-At the nurse's station.
-I'll get it!

02:48.232 --> 02:50.996
-No, I'll get it.
-No, I'm getting it.

02:52.236 --> 02:55.603
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

02:56.206 --> 02:59.403
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else I...

02:59.610 --> 03:01.407
...do not believe we've met.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.379
I'm Rachel Greene.

03:04.648 --> 03:07.879
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

03:08.385 --> 03:10.819
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

03:11.054 --> 03:15.855
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

03:16.393 --> 03:17.985
Oh, that's funny.

03:24.735 --> 03:26.896
I want a baby.

03:27.104 --> 03:30.540
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

03:30.741 --> 03:35.508
-Get up. Let's get some coffee.
-Okay, because we never do that.

03:36.747 --> 03:41.013
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Or just fall down. That's good too.

03:42.019 --> 03:43.179
Knick fan?

03:43.387 --> 03:47.653
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Listen, lady...

03:49.226 --> 03:51.558
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

03:51.762 --> 03:55.129
He couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

03:55.465 --> 03:57.933
-And who do you like?
-Celtics.

03:58.135 --> 04:01.298
Celtics? They couldn't hit a boat if...

04:01.538 --> 04:03.369
Wait...

04:04.374 --> 04:06.467
They suck, all right?

04:06.810 --> 04:09.176
Shut up.
It's a rebuilding year...

04:11.014 --> 04:14.677
Let me get the father.
We need a father over here.

04:14.918 --> 04:16.749
There's no father.

04:18.522 --> 04:22.652
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay. I'm fine.

04:24.328 --> 04:26.091
Okay. Right this way.

04:26.330 --> 04:30.164
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

04:36.273 --> 04:39.868
<i>They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch</i>

04:40.110 --> 04:43.773
<i>But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much</i>

04:45.716 --> 04:49.743
<i>Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why</i>

04:49.953 --> 04:53.889
<i>And you cry and you cry
And you cry</i>

04:54.091 --> 04:57.254
<i>And you cry and you cry
And you cry</i>

04:57.461 --> 05:00.794
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

05:03.033 --> 05:06.969
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

05:08.238 --> 05:09.364
No fair.

05:09.573 --> 05:12.337
I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

05:12.542 --> 05:15.170
-You'll get one.
-When?

05:15.412 --> 05:20.349
Tell you what. When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

05:20.550 --> 05:22.450
...what do you say we have one?

05:22.653 --> 05:25.713
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

05:25.922 --> 05:27.822
I just meant hypothetically.

05:28.025 --> 05:32.086
Hypothetically, why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

05:32.596 --> 05:37.090
What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

05:37.934 --> 05:39.424
Well?

05:39.703 --> 05:42.763
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack.

05:47.277 --> 05:49.541
Look at you, dressy-dress.

05:49.946 --> 05:51.573
Did you go home and change?

05:51.815 --> 05:55.478
It's an important day.
I want to look nice.

05:55.886 --> 05:57.945
Has Dr. Franzblau been by?

05:59.489 --> 06:00.683
I haven't seen him.

06:00.924 --> 06:03.552
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

06:05.996 --> 06:07.896
What if the baby needs him?

06:08.165 --> 06:12.568
What's the deal with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?

06:12.769 --> 06:14.031
Yeah. Why?

06:15.339 --> 06:16.772
No reason.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.738
Mom, we've been through this.

06:20.944 --> 06:23.504
No, I am not calling him.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.908
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk.

06:27.117 --> 06:30.678
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

06:31.688 --> 06:33.417
What do you mean "Joey who"?

06:33.690 --> 06:34.850
Joey who?

06:35.125 --> 06:38.185
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

06:39.229 --> 06:43.222
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.526
She wants to talk to you.

06:46.103 --> 06:47.593
Take the phone.

06:48.872 --> 06:50.271
Yeah, it's me.

06:52.042 --> 06:54.101
No, we're just friends.

06:54.945 --> 06:56.537
Yeah, I'm single.

06:57.381 --> 06:58.643
Twenty-five.

06:59.316 --> 07:02.251
An actor. Hello?

07:07.224 --> 07:09.749
She's not much of a phone person.

07:09.993 --> 07:13.656
So, what's the deal
with this father guy?

07:13.897 --> 07:17.765
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

07:18.068 --> 07:23.062
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? No.

07:25.776 --> 07:28.870
-Maybe I should just go.
-Maybe you should.

07:29.112 --> 07:30.739
Good luck...

07:31.815 --> 07:33.646
...and take care.

07:40.056 --> 07:43.253
The Celtics problem is that
the players run the team.

07:43.493 --> 07:46.621
-That is so not true.
-Oh, it is.

07:46.863 --> 07:48.694
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

07:49.466 --> 07:51.127
You're gonna kill me.

07:51.635 --> 07:55.799
-Fifteen more seconds. 14, 13, 12...
-Count faster.

07:56.006 --> 07:59.942
It'll be okay. Keep focusing on Jordy.
He'll be here soon.

08:00.143 --> 08:04.375
-Three. Two. Who the hell is Jordy?
-Your son.

08:04.581 --> 08:08.608
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We all agreed on Jamie.

08:08.819 --> 08:11.913
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

08:12.122 --> 08:14.113
...so we went back to Jordy.

08:14.524 --> 08:18.654
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy.

08:18.862 --> 08:23.526
We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.

08:24.034 --> 08:26.366
Ow! Leg cramp!

08:26.636 --> 08:28.968
-I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.

08:29.172 --> 08:31.504
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

08:31.708 --> 08:32.800
No, you don't.

08:33.009 --> 08:35.273
That is it.
I want both of you out.

08:35.479 --> 08:36.969
-She started it.
-He did.

08:37.180 --> 08:40.445
I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here...

08:40.650 --> 08:44.643
...and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

08:46.723 --> 08:48.554
-Thanks.
-See what you did?

08:48.792 --> 08:50.760
-Listen...
-Out!

08:52.796 --> 08:55.287
Breathe. Breathe.

09:01.738 --> 09:05.003
What is that? Something exploded.

09:06.109 --> 09:09.567
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke. Calm down.

09:09.779 --> 09:13.044
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

09:13.283 --> 09:15.183
Breathe. Breathe.

09:17.287 --> 09:22.156
I'm okay. I'm okay.
That's disgusting. I'm okay.

09:23.026 --> 09:26.325
-This is so your fault.
-How is this my fault?

09:26.530 --> 09:29.897
Carol never threw me out
of a room before you.

09:30.133 --> 09:33.694
There's a lot of things
Carol never did before me.

09:34.337 --> 09:38.671
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You're so threatened by me.

09:38.875 --> 09:42.971
Hey. Okay, all right.
That's it. Get in here.

09:43.179 --> 09:46.580
My God, you guys.
I don't believe you.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.876
There are children
coming into the world here...

09:50.186 --> 09:53.644
...and your fighting isn't
the first thing they should hear.

09:53.890 --> 09:56.358
So stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

09:59.262 --> 10:03.824
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

10:08.038 --> 10:11.235
Who wants to hear something ironic?

10:15.345 --> 10:17.404
Are they here yet?

10:17.647 --> 10:19.979
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

10:20.183 --> 10:23.584
And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

10:25.155 --> 10:28.556
You were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful.

10:28.758 --> 10:33.354
There was this great little
pastry shop right by my hotel...

10:33.563 --> 10:35.724
There you go, dear.

10:36.766 --> 10:40.395
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria...

10:40.604 --> 10:42.799
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

10:43.406 --> 10:46.136
There's something sinister
going on here.

10:46.343 --> 10:50.109
If you find anyone,
or parts of anyone...

10:50.313 --> 10:54.477
...scream. And scream again.

10:57.387 --> 11:00.049
-Help!
-Come on!

11:00.256 --> 11:03.783
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

11:03.994 --> 11:06.394
Okay, everyone stand back.

11:09.866 --> 11:10.890
Ow.

11:12.068 --> 11:15.231
All right, good thing
we're in a hospital.

11:16.039 --> 11:18.064
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

11:18.274 --> 11:21.175
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

11:21.645 --> 11:23.875
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.947
Let's get that ball and really move.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.141
Let's get...

11:30.353 --> 11:34.949
I was just... Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.689
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

11:42.165 --> 11:44.827
Help! Help!

11:45.802 --> 11:49.829
<i>And they found their bodies
The very next day</i>

11:50.040 --> 11:54.033
<i>And they found their bodies
The very next...</i>

11:58.915 --> 12:00.940
Mom, everything's going fine.

12:01.184 --> 12:02.674
Ross is great.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.611
He's in a whole other place.

12:06.122 --> 12:07.680
No, he's gone.

12:08.324 --> 12:11.487
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

12:11.761 --> 12:16.289
What do you mean "This might be your
only chance"? I'm only 26.

12:16.533 --> 12:19.991
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

12:32.315 --> 12:35.478
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.487
Mazel tov.

12:43.093 --> 12:45.027
It could be one hour or three.

12:45.261 --> 12:47.456
But relax.
She's doing great.

12:47.697 --> 12:52.259
So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

12:53.169 --> 12:56.627
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

12:56.840 --> 13:00.173
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

13:00.477 --> 13:04.174
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

13:04.547 --> 13:09.746
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

13:10.453 --> 13:11.681
...where I do.

13:15.125 --> 13:18.151
I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

13:18.361 --> 13:22.923
But it's hard when, when you do
what I do. It's, like...

13:23.233 --> 13:25.667
Well, for instance,
what do you do?

13:25.869 --> 13:27.302
I'm a waitress.

13:28.505 --> 13:33.272
Aren't there times when you come home
at night and you're, like:

13:33.476 --> 13:37.378
"If I see one more cup of coffee..."

13:42.252 --> 13:43.947
Gotcha.

13:44.354 --> 13:48.484
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

13:57.267 --> 14:00.668
-How'd you know I was here?
-Your mom called me.

14:01.104 --> 14:03.004
So is this her?

14:03.206 --> 14:05.470
No, this is a loaner.

14:07.210 --> 14:09.678
Ours is at the shop.

14:09.913 --> 14:12.677
God, I hope she has my brains.

14:14.184 --> 14:17.085
I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

14:17.620 --> 14:22.557
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
a nurse and a helper guy.

14:24.260 --> 14:29.357
-So did you see who won the game?
-The Knicks by 10. They suck.

14:30.934 --> 14:33.368
They're not so bad.

14:56.359 --> 14:58.156
Come on. Come on.

14:58.361 --> 15:02.923
-You're doing it too hard.
-You have to do it hard or else...

15:03.666 --> 15:04.894
Damn it. Damn it.

15:05.201 --> 15:07.533
Damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

15:07.737 --> 15:10.228
This should be
the greatest day of my life.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.031
My son is being born,
and I should be in there.

15:13.243 --> 15:15.541
Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you.

15:15.812 --> 15:19.009
I have been waiting for this
as much as you.

15:19.215 --> 15:22.378
No one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

15:22.585 --> 15:23.882
You know what's funny?

15:24.153 --> 15:27.680
You go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

15:27.891 --> 15:29.324
You're his father.

15:29.525 --> 15:33.427
Who am I? There's Father's Day.
There's Mother's Day.

15:33.663 --> 15:35.927
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

15:36.199 --> 15:38.667
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

15:41.504 --> 15:44.268
This is so great.

15:47.343 --> 15:49.504
Do you wanna explain that?

15:49.712 --> 15:52.806
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left...

15:53.116 --> 15:56.847
...and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.715
I barely had enough pieces
to make one whole parent.

16:01.157 --> 16:04.456
And here's this baby who has
three whole parents...

16:04.661 --> 16:08.563
...who fight over
who gets to love it the most...

16:08.798 --> 16:10.891
...and it's not even born yet.

16:11.401 --> 16:15.030
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

16:16.706 --> 16:19.038
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.434
Where are they?

16:22.679 --> 16:25.512
-They'll be here.
-They wouldn't miss this.

16:25.748 --> 16:31.084
Relax. You're only at 9 centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.023
You are really frightening me.

16:38.127 --> 16:41.654
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

16:42.799 --> 16:45.359
That's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

16:47.637 --> 16:49.798
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

16:50.006 --> 16:53.271
-Time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.

16:53.476 --> 16:57.936
-I can't tell the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.

17:02.285 --> 17:05.254
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.420
I'm hospital worker Ben.

17:10.093 --> 17:11.754
It's Ben to the rescue.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.497
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

17:17.700 --> 17:21.636
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.265
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.708
What do you see?

17:28.711 --> 17:31.805
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

17:32.048 --> 17:33.208
Wait.

17:33.483 --> 17:36.509
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

17:39.989 --> 17:42.321
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.493
Wait. You forgot your legs.

17:49.298 --> 17:52.461
-Push. Push.
-We're here. We're here.

17:53.803 --> 17:55.430
Where have you been?

17:56.372 --> 17:57.464
Long story.

17:57.673 --> 18:03.077
I need you to keep pushing.
I need... Excuse me, can I have this?

18:04.047 --> 18:08.143
There's too many people here.
There's about to be one more.

18:08.418 --> 18:13.355
So if you're not an ex-husband or
lesbian life partner, out you go.

18:14.857 --> 18:17.087
-Bye-bye.
-Good luck, you guys.

18:17.293 --> 18:21.093
Do you have to be
Carol's lesbian life partner?

18:21.330 --> 18:22.592
Out.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.126
Here he comes.

18:26.369 --> 18:29.167
Let me see. I've gotta see.

18:33.643 --> 18:34.803
A head.

18:35.445 --> 18:37.879
It's huge.
How are you doing this?

18:39.182 --> 18:41.173
You're not helping.

18:41.384 --> 18:43.215
You're doing great.

18:43.453 --> 18:45.353
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry.

18:45.588 --> 18:47.579
What do you see?
What do you see?

18:47.790 --> 18:53.251
We got a head. We got arms.
Oh, look at the little fingers.

18:53.629 --> 18:55.426
A chest and a stomach...

18:55.665 --> 18:59.226
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

18:59.435 --> 19:01.528
Legs, knees and feet.

19:07.810 --> 19:08.970
He's here.

19:10.513 --> 19:12.606
He's a person.

19:13.015 --> 19:15.176
-Look.
-What does he look like?

19:15.852 --> 19:19.185
Kind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

19:20.056 --> 19:21.455
Really?

19:21.991 --> 19:24.221
You guys, he's beautiful.

19:24.494 --> 19:26.121
Thanks, Pheebs.

19:32.335 --> 19:36.897
No shouting, but we still need
a name for this little guy.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.901
-How about Ben?
-I like Ben.

19:44.545 --> 19:47.807
Ben.

19:47.950 --> 19:51.351
Ben's good. How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

19:51.687 --> 19:54.281
We just cooked it up.

19:55.358 --> 19:57.417
That's what we were off doing.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.964
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.966
I know. I know.

20:12.175 --> 20:15.440
Everybody, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

20:16.379 --> 20:18.973
-This is Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

20:19.215 --> 20:21.080
Ben, this is everybody.

20:22.084 --> 20:24.644
Susan, he looks just like you.

20:27.423 --> 20:28.651
Thanks.

20:29.258 --> 20:32.591
I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

20:32.828 --> 20:35.262
I know.
I still am one of these.

20:39.268 --> 20:40.496
Can I?

20:42.405 --> 20:45.431
Okay, the head. You gotta...

20:53.849 --> 20:56.613
I'm your Aunt Monica.
Yes, I am.

20:56.852 --> 20:58.877
I'm your Aunt Monica.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.291
I will always have gum.

21:11.033 --> 21:12.193
Ben...

21:12.802 --> 21:16.568
...I want you to know that
there may be some times when...

21:16.872 --> 21:20.535
...I may not be around like this.

21:23.346 --> 21:25.974
But I'll still always come back...

21:27.083 --> 21:28.880
...like this.

21:30.019 --> 21:33.716
And sometimes,
I may be away longer...

21:34.056 --> 21:35.353
...like this.

21:39.195 --> 21:41.823
But I'll still always come back...

21:44.400 --> 21:46.095
...like this.

21:47.270 --> 21:52.640
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal
third and I'll go like this:

22:00.983 --> 22:02.848
He is so amazing.

22:03.119 --> 22:05.713
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.529
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.

22:16.032 --> 22:18.660
Look, he's closing his eyes.

22:19.368 --> 22:21.996
Look, he's opening his eyes.

22:24.373 --> 22:26.364
He doesn't do much, does he?

22:27.076 --> 22:29.306
Nope, this is pretty much it.

22:37.086 --> 22:39.577
You guys wanna get some coffee?

22:40.823 --> 22:42.848
I'll see you guys later.

23:15.691 --> 23:17.989
He's closing his eyes again.
