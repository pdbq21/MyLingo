WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:03.694
Coffee.

00:04.104 --> 00:06.299
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.632
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.538
Thank you.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.709
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

00:20.887 --> 00:22.286
That's why.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.721
Sorry.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.354
The One With The Stoned Guy

01:21.548 --> 01:22.845
Chandler?

01:23.983 --> 01:26.315
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.

01:26.553 --> 01:30.080
That is a very flattering
sleeve length on you.

01:32.058 --> 01:36.154
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office today.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.696
If it's about those prank memos,
I wasn't involved.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.834
Nothing at all. Really.

01:45.472 --> 01:50.967
And frankly, those shenanigans have
no place in an office environment.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.517
Hey, you guys!

01:58.718 --> 02:01.585
Chandler's coming and
he has incredible news.

02:01.855 --> 02:05.291
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know

02:06.025 --> 02:08.789
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.161
What's going on?

02:11.397 --> 02:14.093
So it's a typical day at work...

02:14.334 --> 02:19.271
...and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.631
-That is great!
-Congratulations!

02:21.875 --> 02:24.070
So I quit.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.942
Why?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.273
Why? This was a temp job.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.379
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

02:31.618 --> 02:35.816
I know, but if I took it, I'd be
admitting that this is what I do.

02:36.022 --> 02:41.085
Does that mean we have to start buying
our own toilet paper?

02:41.294 --> 02:44.752
That was Joey Tribbiani
with the big picture. Dan?

02:45.398 --> 02:46.763
Was it more money?

02:46.966 --> 02:51.528
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office...

02:51.738 --> 02:53.729
...worrying about the WENUS.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.570
The "WENUS"?

02:57.977 --> 03:01.674
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.313
Oh, that WENUS.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.113
What will you do?

03:07.320 --> 03:11.654
I don't know. But I won't
figure it out working there.

03:11.891 --> 03:14.086
I have something you can do!

03:14.327 --> 03:17.626
I have this new massage client, Steve.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.927
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant...

03:21.134 --> 03:23.602
...and he's looking for a head chef.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.205
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.901
I know. You're a chef
and I thought of you first.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.774
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so....

03:38.284 --> 03:41.310
I just don't have a lot
of chef-ing experience.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.615
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.457
What is he looking for?

03:47.660 --> 03:49.890
He wants to do something eclectic.

03:50.096 --> 03:54.658
He's looking for someone
who can create the entire menu.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.697
So, what do you think?

03:58.304 --> 04:01.671
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big, white hat.

04:04.844 --> 04:07.472
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

04:09.782 --> 04:13.775
a perfect run-up
and there he goes, a perfect....

04:13.987 --> 04:15.682
Watch stuff like this...

04:15.888 --> 04:19.346
...and you realize
why evolution is just a theory.

04:23.796 --> 04:28.392
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

04:28.601 --> 04:32.970
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.639
Where are you going?

04:34.841 --> 04:40.837
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

04:41.581 --> 04:44.641
-I added the "a-go-go."
-Career counselor?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.784
You guys all know
what you want to do.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.318
I don't.

04:49.989 --> 04:53.584
You guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.591
You have goals. You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!

04:57.797 --> 05:01.198
The lesser-known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.698
I love my life! I love my life!

05:05.938 --> 05:07.633
"Brian's Song"!

05:10.510 --> 05:13.274
-The meeting went great?
-So great!

05:13.479 --> 05:16.573
He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

05:16.783 --> 05:20.082
It's not too big or too small.
It's just right.

05:20.353 --> 05:24.289
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

05:24.524 --> 05:27.891
I'm cooking for him Monday,
kind of an audition.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.825
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great. You can make yummy noises.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.331
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

05:37.403 --> 05:42.306
-And Monica, what are you gonna make?
-I don't know. It's gotta be great.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.772
I know what you can make!
I know!

05:45.044 --> 05:49.037
You should make that thing
with the stuff.

05:49.615 --> 05:53.415
You know that thing with the stuff?

05:54.587 --> 05:56.612
Okay, I don't know.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.887
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

06:01.094 --> 06:05.463
How about Tony's? If you finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

06:09.168 --> 06:12.831
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

06:13.973 --> 06:17.670
-Who are you going out with?
-ls this the bug lady?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.471
"I love you, Ross."

06:21.748 --> 06:26.082
Her name is Celia and
she's insect curator at the museum.

06:27.687 --> 06:31.316
-What are you gonna do?
-Go out to dinner...

06:31.524 --> 06:36.018
...then bring her back to my place
and introduce her to my monkey.

06:37.930 --> 06:41.093
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

06:42.935 --> 06:48.567
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe....

06:50.009 --> 06:52.671
Well, I don't know....

06:52.879 --> 06:55.245
I'm hoping....

06:56.015 --> 06:58.210
That monkey is a chick magnet.

06:58.451 --> 07:04.219
She'll take one look at his cute,
little face and it'll seal the deal.

07:05.158 --> 07:09.094
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

07:09.295 --> 07:11.320
Soothing tones.

07:12.165 --> 07:16.067
-Here, Marcel.
-I can't stand this.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.171
-He's got his claws on my
-Yeah, all right.

07:27.213 --> 07:30.011
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.915
Good.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.111
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

07:36.322 --> 07:40.156
-It's creamier.
-Yeah? Well, is that better?

07:40.359 --> 07:44.386
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.425
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.801
God, what happened to you?

07:55.007 --> 07:57.976
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...

07:58.177 --> 08:02.477
...intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

08:03.149 --> 08:09.019
"You're suited for data processing for
a large multinational corporation."

08:09.222 --> 08:12.623
That's so great!
You already know how to do that.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.989
Can you believe it?

08:15.228 --> 08:18.664
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something cool?

08:18.931 --> 08:22.833
I just always pictured myself
doing something....

08:23.102 --> 08:24.296
Something!

08:24.570 --> 08:27.539
Chandler, I know, I know.

08:28.174 --> 08:32.440
Hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.811
Maybe this will cheer you up.

08:38.718 --> 08:44.156
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.656
It's supposed to be small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.988
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.693
Well, it is amusing.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.970
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.643
What did we say, $10 an hour?

09:10.850 --> 09:14.411
Okay, great.
All right, I'll see you then.

09:14.620 --> 09:18.886
-$10 an hour for what?
-A waitress from work is helping me.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.186
Waitressing?

09:24.463 --> 09:28.593
Of course I thought of you.
But....

09:28.801 --> 09:30.792
-But....
-But, but....

09:32.538 --> 09:37.237
But it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know?

09:37.543 --> 09:41.639
Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

09:44.016 --> 09:50.012
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

09:52.592 --> 09:57.620
I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '76.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.629
Took home a bronze.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.597
Amuse-bouche?

10:23.489 --> 10:25.616
Talk to me.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.792
A weird thing happened
on the train this morning

10:33.165 --> 10:35.963
Talk dirty.

10:39.138 --> 10:43.234
-Here?
-Come on. Come on.

10:43.442 --> 10:47.037
Say something hot.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.579
What? What?

10:56.789 --> 10:59.257
Vulva.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.571
Vulva?

11:14.907 --> 11:19.105
I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.

11:19.345 --> 11:23.213
But it wasn't a total loss.
We ended up cuddling.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.976
You cuddled? How many times?

11:27.753 --> 11:29.914
Shut up. It was nice.

11:30.122 --> 11:33.182
I don't think
I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.

11:33.392 --> 11:38.125
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.

11:38.330 --> 11:41.697
Or what other people
might be doing to each other.

11:41.901 --> 11:45.132
I'll tell you what.
Try something on me.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.268
Please be kidding.

11:51.744 --> 11:52.904
Why not?

11:53.212 --> 11:58.548
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.956
I'm in my apartment....

12:07.526 --> 12:09.926
-Yeah, what else?
-You're not there.

12:10.129 --> 12:16.125
-We're not having this conversation.
-All right, I'll start. Ready?

12:16.836 --> 12:18.963
Oh, Ross...

12:20.506 --> 12:25.273
...you get me so hot.
I want your lips on me now.

12:29.982 --> 12:33.076
-Now you say something.
-I really don't think so.

12:33.385 --> 12:37.947
You like this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?

12:38.157 --> 12:42.491
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

12:42.695 --> 12:45.255
Now tell me
you wanna caress my butt!

12:48.968 --> 12:51.402
Okay, turn around.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.305
I don't want you staring at me.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.202
All right, I'm not looking.
Go ahead.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.104
Okay.

13:02.014 --> 13:05.245
I want
Okay, I want...

13:05.451 --> 13:10.047
...to feel your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

13:10.256 --> 13:15.250
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.593
I want to take my tongue and

13:31.710 --> 13:33.268
Say it.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.073
Say it!

13:38.484 --> 13:42.477
run it all over your body...

13:43.556 --> 13:46.081
... until you're trembling with

14:05.144 --> 14:07.135
With?

14:08.948 --> 14:12.543
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

14:12.751 --> 14:16.949
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.352
-The trembling thing was nice.
-Shut up!

14:22.561 --> 14:25.621
That guy from your old job
called again.

14:26.298 --> 14:30.098
-Again?
-And again and again and again.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.937
And again.

14:37.576 --> 14:41.876
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

14:42.314 --> 14:43.975
Yeah, I miss you too.

14:44.183 --> 14:48.552
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.248
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.988
I need more than a job.
I need something I really care ab

14:59.398 --> 15:02.390
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

15:02.635 --> 15:03.932
Your dream!

15:04.203 --> 15:07.604
Look, Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

15:07.806 --> 15:11.765
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

15:13.078 --> 15:14.568
Stop saying numbers!

15:14.780 --> 15:18.181
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy!

15:18.417 --> 15:20.977
I'll see you Monday!

15:34.033 --> 15:39.437
Wow! It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.797
This is a cube!

15:42.308 --> 15:44.333
Look at this.

15:47.379 --> 15:50.314
You have a window!

15:50.549 --> 15:53.712
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautiful view of

15:53.919 --> 15:56.854
Look! That guy's peeing!

15:57.790 --> 16:01.021
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.592
Okay, sit down here.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.128
This is great.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.724
-You ready?
-Yeah.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.463
Helen, could you come in here?

16:17.076 --> 16:19.442
Thank you, Helen. That'll be all.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.040
Last time I do that.
I promise.

16:28.153 --> 16:33.090
-She doesn't seem very warm.
-I know. She has no personality.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.921
Wendy, don't do this to me.

16:40.132 --> 16:44.694
We had a deal.
Yeah, you promised.

16:51.343 --> 16:56.042
-Who was that?
-Wendy bailed.

16:56.382 --> 16:59.112
I have no waitress.

16:59.818 --> 17:04.221
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.

17:04.957 --> 17:08.051
Ten dollars an hour!
Twelve dollars an hour!

17:08.460 --> 17:12.897
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

17:13.098 --> 17:16.226
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there.

17:16.468 --> 17:20.404
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing....

17:21.140 --> 17:23.540
Twenty dollars an hour.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.799
Done.

17:32.251 --> 17:36.347
Hello. Welcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?

17:39.458 --> 17:41.426
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.925
Hello, greeter girl.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.490
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.128
Everything smells so delicious.

17:51.336 --> 17:55.636
I can't remember ever smelling
such a delicious combination of

17:55.841 --> 17:57.103
Okay, smells.

17:58.644 --> 18:03.104
-It's a lovely apartment.
-Thank you. Would you like a tour?

18:03.315 --> 18:06.478
I was just being polite,
but all right.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.052
-What's up?
-ln the cab on the way over...

18:12.257 --> 18:14.657
...Steve blazed up a doobie.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.392
What?

18:17.596 --> 18:21.999
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja

18:23.502 --> 18:25.402
I'm with you, Cheech.

18:27.506 --> 18:32.000
-Do you think he's gonna be cool?
-ls it dry in here?

18:34.646 --> 18:36.739
Let me get you some wine.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.449
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

18:42.721 --> 18:47.385
These are rock shrimp ravioli
in a cilantro ponzu sauce...

18:47.659 --> 18:50.355
...with just a touch of minced...

18:55.234 --> 18:57.065
...ginger.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.705
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

19:03.642 --> 19:07.772
-These are fantastic!
-Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.504
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!

19:13.652 --> 19:15.745
That's all there is of these...

19:16.021 --> 19:19.320
...but in a few minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.553
"Tartlets"?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.523
"Tartlets."

19:24.263 --> 19:26.128
"Tartlets."

19:27.799 --> 19:29.733
Word has lost all meaning.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.042
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

19:39.244 --> 19:42.975
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.361
Cool! Taco shells!

20:02.467 --> 20:05.834
They're like a little
corn envelope, you know?

20:06.038 --> 20:10.907
-You don't wanna spoil your appetite.
-Hey, Sugar-O's!

20:11.210 --> 20:14.577
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes

20:14.813 --> 20:18.408
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

20:22.387 --> 20:26.380
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.853
Sorry.

20:32.764 --> 20:35.562
Why don't you just have a seat here?

20:40.973 --> 20:44.773
-Give me the gummy bears.
-No.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.838
-Give them to me.
-We'll share.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.539
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.912
It's not worth it!

20:55.120 --> 20:57.987
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

20:59.558 --> 21:03.289
Don't just stand there.
Call 9-1 -1.

21:03.495 --> 21:06.987
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

21:07.266 --> 21:12.169
Help! Help, I'm drowning!

21:12.704 --> 21:16.231
-That's it! Dinner is over!
-What! Why?

21:16.441 --> 21:21.140
Why? What if I came into your office
and I started...?

21:21.613 --> 21:23.376
I can't think of an example.

21:23.582 --> 21:27.040
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...

21:27.286 --> 21:30.881
...and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes
for a tartlet?

21:39.464 --> 21:42.433
So I told him,
"I'm sorry. That's how I feel."

21:42.634 --> 21:46.434
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.

21:47.172 --> 21:51.302
Then I said, "Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet."

21:52.577 --> 21:57.446
And he didn't listen,
so we left him in the emergency room.

21:57.716 --> 22:02.050
-Mon, I'm sorry.
-What a tool.

22:02.321 --> 22:07.315
-You did the right thing.
-You don't wanna work for that guy.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.324
I just thought that this was it.

22:10.629 --> 22:16.625
-Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.
-Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

22:17.369 --> 22:20.270
Am I gonna get paid
for the full three hours?

22:20.472 --> 22:24.033
Just a question.
We'll talk about it later.

22:28.213 --> 22:30.374
So, how did it go with Celia?

22:31.917 --> 22:36.047
-I was unbelievable.
-All right, Ross!

22:36.254 --> 22:38.916
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.854
It was the most elaborate filth
ever heard.

22:42.060 --> 22:47.327
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines, themes, a motif.

22:47.599 --> 22:50.295
At one point, there were villagers.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.399
And?

22:54.973 --> 22:58.170
By the time we finished
all the dirty talk...

22:58.410 --> 23:00.901
...it was late
and we were exhausted

23:01.113 --> 23:03.809
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.913
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

23:08.120 --> 23:11.817
-Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
-Where the hell is he?

23:12.290 --> 23:14.190
I know what time it is...

23:14.459 --> 23:18.122
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

23:18.797 --> 23:20.731
Let me tell you something.

23:20.966 --> 23:26.165
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

23:41.019 --> 23:42.782
How's this?

23:42.988 --> 23:45.286
Sorry. How about over here?

23:45.524 --> 23:47.287
That means it's working.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.618
-Does this hurt?
-No.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.087
How about this?

23:52.497 --> 23:54.897
There you go!

24:01.139 --> 24:03.699
I'm gonna throw up!
