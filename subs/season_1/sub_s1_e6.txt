WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.803
Oh, look look look! There's Joey's picture!

00:08.008 --> 00:09.270
This is so exciting!

00:09.542 --> 00:12.568
You can always spot someone who's
never seen his one of his plays before.

00:12.779 --> 00:16.237
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

00:17.050 --> 00:22.147
"The role of man number three
will not be played by Vic Shapiro. "

00:22.355 --> 00:24.653
We came on the wrong night.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.492
I can't believe I forgot to bring a magazine.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.687
-Come on you guys, this might be good.
-I don't know.

00:31.898 --> 00:36.733
The exclamation point scares me.
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

00:37.904 --> 00:39.769
Magic is about to happen!

00:40.840 --> 00:42.364
Well, Eva...

00:43.143 --> 00:46.237
...we've done
some excellent work here.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.243
And I would have to say...

00:49.783 --> 00:53.514
...your problem is quite clear.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.586
All you want is a dinkle

00:58.958 --> 01:01.825
What you envy's a schwang

01:02.028 --> 01:05.429
A thing through which you can tinkle

01:05.632 --> 01:08.260
To play with or simply let hang

01:23.016 --> 01:25.246
The One With the Butt

02:22.909 --> 02:24.877
I feel violated.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.911
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

02:29.115 --> 02:31.583
...to have something else to do?

02:31.784 --> 02:32.773
Ross, 1 0:00.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.748
Is it? It feels like 2.

02:36.089 --> 02:39.650
-No, 1 0:00!
-What?

02:39.859 --> 02:44.159
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

02:45.899 --> 02:47.093
Hello!

02:47.367 --> 02:52.964
She's amazing! She makes the women l
dream about look like fat, bald men.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.073
Go over.
She's not with anyone.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.733
And what would my opening line be?
Excuse me....

03:01.314 --> 03:03.714
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.886
Could she be more out of my league?
Back me up.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.612
He couldn't get a woman
like that in a million years.

03:12.091 --> 03:15.891
You always see these beautiful
women with "nothing" guys.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.654
You could be one of those guys.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.966
-You could do that.
-You think?

03:21.234 --> 03:22.531
Absolutely!

03:22.735 --> 03:25.067
I can't believe
I'm considering this.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.796
-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.837
Here goes.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.206
Stand back, everyone.
Incoming ego shrapnel.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.904
All right, I can do this.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.782
-Yes?
-Hi.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.314
Okay, next word would be...

03:45.592 --> 03:46.581
... Chandler.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.422
Chandler is my name and....

03:50.964 --> 03:52.727
Hi!

03:54.033 --> 03:55.466
Yes, you said that.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.671
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

03:58.938 --> 04:00.963
What I wanted to say was...

04:01.174 --> 04:04.905
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.305
Chandler?

04:09.882 --> 04:13.147
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

04:13.353 --> 04:15.253
What'd you think?

04:15.622 --> 04:18.887
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

04:19.125 --> 04:21.685
It wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

04:21.894 --> 04:26.160
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.527
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.002
How about that accent?

04:31.204 --> 04:35.971
Yeah. All of your W's were V's.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.909
She said yes!

04:40.346 --> 04:44.214
Awful play, man!

04:44.417 --> 04:48.911
Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian
and she pronounces my name " Chandler. "

04:50.857 --> 04:52.188
I like that better.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.121
The usher gave me this.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.521
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard T alent Agency.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.460
An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!

05:00.667 --> 05:02.225
Based on this play?

05:04.337 --> 05:06.430
Based on this play!

05:06.639 --> 05:08.800
Look! There's a note on the back.

05:09.008 --> 05:12.569
"Loved your work. Call me a sap. "

05:14.480 --> 05:16.948
She was obviously very moved!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.641
You should call her fairly quickly.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.412
Yeah! As soon as possible!

05:25.591 --> 05:27.149
Come in!

05:28.361 --> 05:30.761
Hi. I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.421
Just a moment, let me see
if she's in.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.266
Hello.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.670
-You' re Estelle?
-I know...

05:40.873 --> 05:45.333
...you weren't expecting someone
so fantastically beautiful.

05:47.647 --> 05:52.744
Love lump. T ake a load off already,
darling. Sit already.

05:53.052 --> 05:56.283
I can't tell you how excited
I am to be here.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.389
Why not?

05:59.492 --> 06:03.758
-What I meant was
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?

06:09.001 --> 06:09.990
Joey...

06:10.203 --> 06:13.400
...sweetheart, let me ask you
a question.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.269
Did you ever see the movie
Sleepless in Seattle?

06:17.477 --> 06:20.776
-Wow! Do you represent those actors?
-No.

06:21.247 --> 06:24.683
But you know the end,
where they' re happy?

06:24.884 --> 06:27.512
That's gonna be you and me.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.354
You mean you wanna sign me?

06:30.556 --> 06:35.892
No, I wanna go to the top of the
Empire State Building and make out.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.822
Of course I wanna sign you!

06:39.599 --> 06:42.033
-Miss Leonard, I'm so
-Oh, boy.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.068
-Ride them, cowboy.
-l' m sorry!

06:55.181 --> 06:58.309
I don't see it!

06:59.886 --> 07:03.049
-T ry to look through it.
-Unfocus your eyes.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.816
Focus? There's nothing to focus on.

07:06.492 --> 07:09.950
-It's the Statue of Liberty!
-Right!

07:10.163 --> 07:13.030
-Where's the Statue of Liberty?
-There.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.995
I can't not see it now.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.027
Hey, kids!

07:18.237 --> 07:20.603
Come here. Do you see anything here?

07:20.807 --> 07:24.208
-lt looks like a boat.
-A boat.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.277
Right in front of
the Statue of Liberty.

07:29.148 --> 07:33.676
It's been seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

07:33.886 --> 07:36.150
How was your date, Chandler?

07:36.355 --> 07:37.652
It was unbelievable!

07:37.857 --> 07:41.486
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had an amazing life!

07:41.694 --> 07:43.525
She was in the Israeli army.

07:43.729 --> 07:48.257
None of the bullets hit the engine,
so we made it to the border.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.028
But just barely, and l....

07:51.237 --> 07:55.298
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.703
What about you? T ell me a story.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.673
All right, once...

08:00.880 --> 08:02.677
... I got on the subway.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.679
And it was at night...

08:04.884 --> 08:08.012
...and I rode it all the way
to Brooklyn.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.519
Just for the hell of it.

08:11.023 --> 08:13.651
We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

08:14.694 --> 08:15.718
More or less.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.395
Suddenly, we realized we were
in Yemen.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.390
I' m sorry, so "we" is...?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.498
"We" is me and Rick.

08:22.702 --> 08:23.691
Who's Rick?

08:23.903 --> 08:25.200
Who's Rick?

08:26.405 --> 08:27.429
My husband.

08:30.142 --> 08:33.270
-Oh, so you' re divorced?
-No.

08:33.479 --> 08:37.609
I' m sorry. So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?

08:37.817 --> 08:40.285
No, l' m still married.

08:40.953 --> 08:45.583
So, how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

08:45.791 --> 08:51.093
...sliding your foot so far up my leg
you can count the change in my pocket?

08:52.231 --> 08:53.630
Don't worry.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.530
He'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

08:58.404 --> 09:00.804
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

09:01.941 --> 09:05.377
Ethan is my boyfriend.

09:05.578 --> 09:06.738
What?

09:08.814 --> 09:12.181
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

09:12.385 --> 09:15.354
...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.683
I suppose, mainly sexual.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.254
Sorry it didn't work out.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.761
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.594
Didn't you listen to the story?

09:30.870 --> 09:33.304
Didn't you listen? It's twisted!

09:33.506 --> 09:35.736
How could you get involved
with her?

09:35.942 --> 09:39.844
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.

09:40.046 --> 09:43.015
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

09:43.215 --> 09:46.048
...and none of the responsibility.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.648
-This is every guy's fantasy!
-That's not true!

09:49.855 --> 09:53.586
-Ross, is this your fantasy?
-No, of course not.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.125
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

09:57.997 --> 10:01.558
You'd go out with someone
going out with someone else?

10:02.034 --> 10:04.059
-I couldn't.
-Good for you.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.794
When l' m with a woman,
I need to know...

10:07.006 --> 10:09.941
... I' m going out
with more people than her.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.879
Once, I went out with a guy who
just got divorced.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.447
It was hard. His kids liked me
better than him.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.312
What does this have to do
with Chandler?

10:21.187 --> 10:22.984
Nothing.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.984
I didn't have anything
on that topic.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.319
So I went another way.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.231
You know, monogamy can be
a tricky concept.

10:33.432 --> 10:36.367
I mean, anthropologically speaking

10:37.737 --> 10:39.864
Fine. Now you'll never know.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.699
We' re kidding. T ell us.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.499
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

10:43.709 --> 10:47.543
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey

10:58.658 --> 11:01.855
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like it.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.157
Look! I cleaned!

11:05.364 --> 11:07.628
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

11:07.867 --> 11:12.827
I used all the vacuum attachments but
the round one. What's it for?

11:13.039 --> 11:16.236
Nobody knows.
And we're not supposed to ask.

11:16.442 --> 11:17.568
What do you think?

11:17.810 --> 11:21.268
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

11:25.117 --> 11:27.711
I see you moved the green ottoman.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.082
How did that happen?

11:34.493 --> 11:37.053
I don't know. It looked better there.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.627
And it's an extra seat
around the table.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.930
Yeah, it's interesting.

11:44.603 --> 11:46.867
But you know what? Just for fun...

11:47.206 --> 11:50.698
...Iet's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.171
Just to compare.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.676
Let's see.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.014
Well, it looks good there too.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.543
Let's leave it there for a while.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.920
I can't believe you moved
the green ottoman.

12:04.523 --> 12:08.960
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.
She'll scratch your eyes out.

12:09.161 --> 12:12.392
-You guys, I am not that bad!
-Yeah, you are.

12:13.799 --> 12:17.291
Remember, I lived with you?
You were a little....

12:21.474 --> 12:22.771
That is so unfair!

12:22.975 --> 12:28.003
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.110
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.342
But hey, I can be a kook!

12:36.589 --> 12:38.648
All right, you madcap gal!

12:40.426 --> 12:41.518
Imagine this.

12:41.794 --> 12:45.730
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.456
-Why not?
-Because you're a kook!

12:50.569 --> 12:53.367
You wait until they send a notice.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.471
I could do that.

12:55.674 --> 12:59.701
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping

12:59.912 --> 13:03.177
-No problem.
-I'm not done yet.

13:03.716 --> 13:08.619
And I buy detergent, but it's not
the one with the easy-pour spout.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.449
Why would someone do that?

13:12.591 --> 13:15.059
One might wonder.

13:15.861 --> 13:19.126
But I would be fine with that.

13:19.331 --> 13:24.030
A glass is on the table with no
coaster. A cold drink. A hot day.

13:24.703 --> 13:29.037
Beads of condensation are inching
closer to the wood....

13:29.241 --> 13:30.333
Stop it!

13:34.079 --> 13:35.341
Oh, my God!

13:35.781 --> 13:37.715
It's true. Who am l?

13:38.250 --> 13:40.241
Monica, you' re Mom.

13:48.627 --> 13:49.685
Oh, my God!

13:52.364 --> 13:54.093
Okay, I'll be there.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.027
That was my agent.

13:59.972 --> 14:05.933
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

14:06.145 --> 14:08.909
-That's great!
-What's the part?

14:09.114 --> 14:13.244
Can you believe it? Pacino!
This guy's why I became an actor!

14:13.452 --> 14:19.220
" Out of order? You' re out of order!
This whole courtroom's out of order! "

14:19.825 --> 14:21.588
Seriously, what's the part?

14:21.794 --> 14:25.491
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! "

14:25.764 --> 14:28.824
Come on. Seriously, Joey,
what's the part?

14:30.769 --> 14:32.361
You' re.... What?

14:34.940 --> 14:38.171
I' m his butt double, okay?

14:41.747 --> 14:44.375
I play Al Pacino's butt.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.783
All right? He goes into the shower,
and then...

14:50.089 --> 14:52.080
... I' m his butt.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.618
Oh, my God!

14:53.926 --> 14:55.086
Come on, you guys.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.626
It's a real Pacino movie
and that's big!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.492
It's terrific. You deserve this.

15:01.700 --> 15:06.535
After years of struggling you've
cracked your way into show business.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.640
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.336
-This is a big break for me!
-You' re right. It is.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.508
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

15:29.328 --> 15:32.263
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?

15:32.464 --> 15:34.489
T oday's the big day!

15:37.169 --> 15:40.400
You got any tweezers? I think
I have a rogue hair.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.975
God. Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

15:44.176 --> 15:47.009
Don't ever tell me what you did
in there.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.907
Thank you.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.481
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.

15:53.686 --> 15:57.247
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.048
My eyes! My eyes!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.256
I warned you.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.159
Who is being loud?

16:07.366 --> 16:09.129
Oh, that would be Monica.

16:09.902 --> 16:13.030
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.035
You got the whole night?

16:15.240 --> 16:18.232
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so....

16:18.444 --> 16:20.344
Do I sense resentment?

16:20.612 --> 16:23.672
No. No resentment. Believe me...

16:23.949 --> 16:26.008
...it's worth it, okay?

16:26.285 --> 16:31.052
In a relationship, you have moments
you'll remember the rest of your life.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.554
Every single second is like that
with Aurora.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.422
I've just wasted 35 of them
talking to you.

16:37.629 --> 16:40.757
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

16:42.067 --> 16:44.661
The old Monica would remind you...

16:44.870 --> 16:48.897
...to scrub that T eflon pan with
a plastic brush.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.309
But l' m not gonna do that.

16:58.484 --> 17:03.353
Excuse me? Can they warm it up?
I' m concerned about goose bumps.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.749
Everybody ready?

17:06.191 --> 17:09.126
I wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

17:09.328 --> 17:14.561
I mean, I know this is just a first
step, but I hope that someday

17:14.767 --> 17:15.825
Lose the robe.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.762
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

17:20.606 --> 17:22.631
Okay, and the robe is lost.

17:23.342 --> 17:26.106
I would like to get this in one take.

17:26.345 --> 17:27.676
Let's roll it.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.939
Water's working.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.845
And action!

17:33.952 --> 17:35.476
And cut!

17:36.188 --> 17:38.782
Butt guy, what are you doing?

17:39.124 --> 17:40.489
I'm showering.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.986
No, that was clenching.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.892
The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

17:47.099 --> 17:49.499
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.534
I think his butt would be angry here.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.801
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.910
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.813
And action!

18:04.149 --> 18:06.743
And cut! What was that?

18:07.886 --> 18:11.253
I was going for quiet desperation.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.850
But if you have to ask....

18:21.166 --> 18:23.031
God, I love these fingers.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.428
Thank you.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.764
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.309
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.703
-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!

18:35.981 --> 18:38.882
-Don't go.
-Okay.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.013
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.112
I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

18:45.324 --> 18:49.055
-I thought you talked to Rick.
-It's not Rick.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.626
Ethan? He gets the whole day!

18:51.864 --> 18:54.594
No, it's Andrew.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.769
I know there'll be moments...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.602
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but....

19:05.310 --> 19:07.835
-And Andrew is?
-He's...

19:08.113 --> 19:09.876
... new.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.775
So you' re not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

19:14.987 --> 19:17.455
No, that's not exactly what I was

19:17.656 --> 19:19.385
Most women would kill...

19:19.591 --> 19:21.752
...for three guys like us.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.292
-So, what do you want?
-You.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.160
-You have me.
-No. Just you.

19:29.701 --> 19:33.159
-What do you mean?
-Lose the other guys.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.765
Like, all of them?

19:37.309 --> 19:40.244
Come on, we' re great together.
Why not?

19:40.445 --> 19:42.504
Can't we have what we have now?

19:42.714 --> 19:45.148
Why can't we talk and make love...

19:45.350 --> 19:48.217
...without feeling obligated
to each other?

19:48.520 --> 19:52.456
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.822
Well, part of me wants that...

19:57.029 --> 20:01.830
... but it's like l' m two guys.
One guy's saying, "This is great! "

20:02.034 --> 20:03.899
But there's this other guy.

20:04.102 --> 20:07.503
The guy who wells up
when the Grinch's heart grows...

20:07.706 --> 20:10.266
...and breaks that measuring device.

20:10.509 --> 20:15.412
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out! "

20:15.614 --> 20:18.640
So, which one of the guys
will you listen to?

20:19.518 --> 20:24.512
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.390
Which one?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.295
The second guy.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.589
I see.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.438
Call me if you change your mind.

20:49.414 --> 20:53.612
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

21:05.731 --> 21:08.632
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

21:09.801 --> 21:14.135
Right? I mean, this woman was
unbelievably sexy...

21:14.339 --> 21:18.537
...and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.079
T ell me why you did this again?

21:24.316 --> 21:25.749
Movie star!

21:25.951 --> 21:30.786
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

21:31.657 --> 21:32.817
Nope.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.721
No? What happened, big guy?

21:35.927 --> 21:37.827
Big guy?

21:39.231 --> 21:42.132
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.725
I got fired!

21:44.936 --> 21:48.133
They said I acted too much with it.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.535
I told everybody about this!

21:51.743 --> 21:54.541
-Everybody's expecting to see me.
-lKnow what?

21:54.746 --> 21:58.443
-No one will be able to tell.
-My mom will.

22:00.385 --> 22:04.446
There's something so sweet
and disturbing about that.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.659
I've done crappy plays
for six years...

22:08.894 --> 22:12.330
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

22:12.531 --> 22:14.294
Maybe this wasn't it.

22:14.499 --> 22:19.368
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.597
Did it feel like your shot?

22:23.408 --> 22:26.138
Hard to tell. I was naked.

22:26.345 --> 22:30.406
I don't think this was it.
I don't think you just get one.

22:30.615 --> 22:34.016
I believe things are gonna happen
for you. I do.

22:34.219 --> 22:38.121
You've got to think about
the day some kid will go:

22:38.323 --> 22:43.192
"l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey T ribbiani's ass! "

22:45.330 --> 22:48.390
You think? That's so nice.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.941
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.406
-Good night.
-Good night.

22:59.611 --> 23:02.205
You' re gonna leave
your shoes out here?

23:05.951 --> 23:08.852
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

23:09.054 --> 23:12.922
...in that reckless, haphazard manner?

23:13.258 --> 23:17.786
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

23:18.730 --> 23:21.164
Whenever.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.166
She is a kook.

23:37.949 --> 23:42.613
If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.

23:43.522 --> 23:46.116
No, don 't do this!

23:46.324 --> 23:47.791
This is stupid!

23:47.993 --> 23:51.656
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna get them.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.763
But then everyone will know.

23:55.233 --> 23:59.670
Unless I get them, then wake up
really early and put them back.

23:59.871 --> 24:02.237
I need help!

24:05.610 --> 24:09.671
-All you want is a dinkle
-Not that song!

24:09.881 --> 24:13.874
-All you envy's a schwang
-Come on, you guys.

24:14.085 --> 24:17.816
A thing through which you can tinkle

24:18.023 --> 24:20.958
Or play with or simply let hang

24:22.060 --> 24:25.860
All you want is a dinkle

24:26.064 --> 24:29.397
What you envy's a schwang

24:29.601 --> 24:33.128
A thing through which you can tinkle

24:33.338 --> 24:37.741
Or play with or simply let hang
