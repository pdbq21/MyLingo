WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.032
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

00:04.572 --> 00:07.063
...and his Mr. Winky.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.732
And...

00:10.277 --> 00:11.301
... him. Hi!

00:12.580 --> 00:14.639
-How did everything go? <br/>-Great!

00:14.915 --> 00:17.042
There was a projectile...

00:17.585 --> 00:20.110
...throwing up incident, <br/>but he started it.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.482
We've gotta go.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.251
Oh, right.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.393
I've got some news. <br/>It's about us.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.459
You and me?

00:29.730 --> 00:31.664
No. Susan and me.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.594
The other "us."

00:38.072 --> 00:39.596
We're getting married.

00:45.312 --> 00:48.907
As in, "I now pronounce you <br/>wife and wife" married?

00:49.850 --> 00:53.411
We'd like you to come. <br/>We understand if you don't want to.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.750
Why wouldn't I want to come? <br/>I had fun at the first wedding.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.255
I just thought that

01:00.994 --> 01:05.488
Why shouldn't I be happy for you? <br/>What would it say about me...

01:05.699 --> 01:08.759
...if I couldn't revel <br/>in your joy?

01:08.969 --> 01:11.437
And I'm reveling, baby! <br/>Believe me!

01:11.972 --> 01:14.133
Is your finger caught in that chair?

01:16.343 --> 01:17.833
Want us to go?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.471
The One With the Lesbian Wedding

02:07.995 --> 02:10.725
This is cool. <br/>You're actually on television.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.968
I know. <br/>It really hit me last night.

02:12.968 --> 02:14.902
I'm on Days of our Lives.

02:17.038 --> 02:21.771
Then I started thinking about us, <br/>and how these are the days of our lives.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.276
Yes!

02:25.480 --> 02:26.280
What?

02:26.281 --> 02:29.307
Carol and Susan's caterer <br/>had a bike accident...

02:29.517 --> 02:31.644
...and she's in a <br/>full-body cast.

02:35.457 --> 02:38.426
They want me to do it, which is cool <br/>since I've never catered...

02:38.927 --> 02:41.327
...and I need the money. <br/>Is this a problem for you, isn't it?

02:41.596 --> 02:43.655
-Would it matter? <br/>-You're so great!

02:43.898 --> 02:45.126
Thank you!

02:45.333 --> 02:47.824
-You're really not going? <br/>-I'm really not.

02:48.136 --> 02:51.799
They already live together. <br/>Why do they need to get married?

02:52.173 --> 02:53.640
They love each other.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.436
They wanna celebrate that love <br/>with the people close to them.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.307
If you wanna call <br/>that a reason.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.747
Who's the bitterest <br/>man in the living room?

03:05.520 --> 03:07.852
The bitterest man <br/>in the living room?

03:09.424 --> 03:10.413
Hi, neighbor.

03:12.927 --> 03:17.023
-I thought you were over this. <br/>-That has nothing to do with it.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.860
She is my ex-wife, If she were marrying a guy, <br/>you wouldn't expect me to go.

03:21.102 --> 03:24.868
If she were marrying a guy, <br/>she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.274
Did I miss it?

03:29.477 --> 03:32.674
No, I'm on right after this guy <br/>shoots himself.

03:33.648 --> 03:34.979
She's pretty.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.182
And she's really nice.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.320
She taught me about <br/>how to work with the cameras...

03:40.521 --> 03:42.386
...and smell-the-fart acting.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.291
-I'm sorry, what? <br/>-Excuse me?

03:48.291 --> 03:52.062
smell-the-fart acting

03:52.062 --> 03:55.225
You got so many lines <br/>to learn so fast that sometimes...

03:55.532 --> 03:58.069
...you need a minute <br/>to remember your next one.

03:58.069 --> 03:59.798
So while you're thinking...

04:00.004 --> 04:03.462
...you take this big pause <br/>where you look all intense.

04:03.674 --> 04:04.698
Like this....

04:11.816 --> 04:13.716
Here's my scene! <br/>Here's my scene!

04:16.521 --> 04:17.510
Mrs. Wallace?

04:18.422 --> 04:20.822
Dr. Drake Ramoray, <br/>your sister's neurosurgeon.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.151
Is she going to be all right?

04:23.361 --> 04:27.229
I'm afraid the situation <br/>is much more dire than we'd expected.

04:27.431 --> 04:29.729
Your sister's suffering from a...

04:35.673 --> 04:37.698
...subcranial hematoma.

04:39.544 --> 04:43.412
Perhaps we can <br/>discuss this further over coffee.

04:49.587 --> 04:50.611
Nice!

04:52.256 --> 04:55.783
For a minute, I thought you were <br/>actually smelling something.

04:58.596 --> 05:00.029
-Do it again! <br/>-All right!

05:00.231 --> 05:02.461
-That was so good! <br/>-Do it again.

05:03.401 --> 05:06.199
"Damn it, Braverman! <br/>It's right there on the chart!"

05:07.872 --> 05:11.808
I gotta get to work. <br/>I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

05:12.043 --> 05:13.067
No, that's me.

05:13.277 --> 05:14.574
Oh, right.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.779
Oh, thanks. Couldn't....

05:23.788 --> 05:24.880
Is everything okay?

05:25.589 --> 05:26.715
No.

05:29.227 --> 05:32.560
One of my clients died <br/>on the massage table today.

05:32.797 --> 05:34.162
Oh, my God!

05:34.665 --> 05:37.725
That's a little more relaxed <br/>than you want them to get.

05:40.238 --> 05:42.900
She was, you know, <br/>82 years old...

05:43.307 --> 05:46.470
...and her name was <br/>Mrs. Adelman.

05:46.677 --> 05:47.507
Oh, honey.

05:47.778 --> 05:50.303
It's just so strange. You know...

05:50.514 --> 05:53.244
...she probably woke up <br/>this morning and thought...

05:53.451 --> 05:57.182
... I'll have some breakfast, <br/>take a walk, then have my massage.

05:57.421 --> 06:00.584
Little did she know God thought, <br/>"Okay, but that's it."

06:04.328 --> 06:07.092
Oh, but the weirdest things was...

06:07.298 --> 06:10.529
... I was cleansing her aura <br/>when it happened.

06:10.768 --> 06:13.430
And when her spirit <br/>left her body...

06:13.671 --> 06:15.866
... I don't think it went very far.

06:16.941 --> 06:17.965
What do you mean?

06:18.876 --> 06:21.276
I think it went into me.

06:30.054 --> 06:31.282
This is so hard.

06:31.489 --> 06:33.548
I can't decide <br/>between lamb or duck.

06:33.791 --> 06:35.452
Well, lambs are scarier.

06:35.693 --> 06:39.026
Otherwise the movie would've been <br/>called silence of the Ducks.

06:40.665 --> 06:42.189
Okay, who ordered what?

06:42.466 --> 06:46.732
I had the half-drunk cappuccino <br/>with the lipstick on the rim.

06:47.338 --> 06:50.637
And this with the cigarette <br/>butt in it, is that decaf?

06:50.841 --> 06:52.468
Oh, God.

06:52.677 --> 06:54.804
You're so uptight <br/>about your mom coming.

06:55.012 --> 06:58.311
I know. I just don't want <br/>her to think that because...

06:58.549 --> 07:01.040
... I didn't marry Barry <br/>my life is total crap.

07:01.252 --> 07:04.085
Talk about crap, just <br/>listen to Stella Neidman...

07:04.322 --> 07:07.587
...tell her story about Rod Steiger <br/>for the hundredth time.

07:12.587 --> 07:17.587
I'm sorry. At least you guys haven't <br/>need to hear staff she said in my head.

07:20.629 --> 07:24.690
Pheebs? How long do you think <br/>this lady will be with us?

07:24.933 --> 07:28.369
I don't know. She obviously <br/>has some unfinished business.

07:28.604 --> 07:29.628
Sit up!

07:33.042 --> 07:34.202
There she is!

07:34.443 --> 07:36.206
-Mom! <br/>-Hey, sweetie!

07:42.451 --> 07:44.976
So this is where you work!

07:45.254 --> 07:47.415
Oh, it's wonderful!

07:47.656 --> 07:51.615
Is it a living room? <br/>Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

07:52.161 --> 07:53.890
I guess that's the fun.

07:54.096 --> 07:56.121
Pretty much. <br/>Here, meet my friends.

07:56.331 --> 07:59.266
Monica! You look gorgeous!

07:59.468 --> 08:03.734
Oh, my! The last time I saw you, <br/>it was eat or be eaten.

08:04.606 --> 08:06.130
This is Joey.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.433
This is Phoebe.

08:07.676 --> 08:08.904
This is Chandler.

08:09.144 --> 08:10.236
You remember Ross?

08:10.446 --> 08:11.572
Oh, hello, Ross.

08:11.847 --> 08:12.779
Mrs. Greene.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.310
What do you think of my <br/>daughter, in the apron...

08:18.520 --> 08:19.680
...with the big job!

08:20.089 --> 08:21.351
Oh, Mom!

08:22.691 --> 08:27.424
If you didn't pour the coffee, <br/>no one would have anything to drink.

08:27.863 --> 08:30.331
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

08:32.434 --> 08:35.835
This is just so exciting! <br/>You know, I never worked.

08:36.105 --> 08:39.302
I went straight from my father's house <br/>to the sorority house...

08:39.508 --> 08:43.239
...to my husband's house. <br/>I am just so proud of you!

08:43.445 --> 08:44.935
Really?

08:45.435 --> 08:47.035
Let's make a day of it!

08:47.135 --> 08:51.935
We will have lunch, we will shopping, <br/>we will get nails done, whatever you want.

08:52.435 --> 08:53.247
Mom, I have to work.

08:54.247 --> 08:56.247
What! No one else can pour coffee?

08:57.747 --> 08:59.681
I know who you remind me of.

09:00.317 --> 09:01.409
Evelyn Durmer.

09:01.651 --> 09:06.520
That's before the lousy face-lift. <br/>Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

09:10.093 --> 09:12.584
Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?

09:13.863 --> 09:16.354
I don't know. <br/>Who's Soupy Sales?

09:19.302 --> 09:20.200
Oh, my God!

09:20.770 --> 09:24.035
There's an unattractive <br/>nude man playing the cello.

09:25.475 --> 09:28.535
Just be glad he's not playing <br/>a smaller instrument.

09:32.749 --> 09:34.876
You have some life here, sweetie!

09:35.118 --> 09:38.576
Mom, I realize you and dad were upset <br/>when I didn't marry Barry...

09:38.788 --> 09:42.417
...and get the house in the suburbs <br/>with all the security.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.650
This is just <br/>so much better for me.

09:44.894 --> 09:48.830
I do know. <br/>You didn't love Barry, honey.

09:49.065 --> 09:51.625
And I've never seen you this happy.

09:51.834 --> 09:55.326
I look at you and I think, <br/>"This is what I want."

09:57.473 --> 09:59.168
For me.

10:00.109 --> 10:02.509
Well, not just for you.

10:02.779 --> 10:03.803
What do you mean?

10:04.981 --> 10:09.077
I'm considering <br/>leaving your father.

10:11.988 --> 10:14.320
All right, tell me <br/>if this is too cute.

10:14.591 --> 10:17.424
Lesbian wedding... <br/>chicken breasts.

10:21.464 --> 10:24.524
Oh, God. <br/>I think I'm gonna be sick.

10:24.801 --> 10:28.259
What? It's not like I'm putting <br/>little nipples on them.

10:30.259 --> 10:34.259
Oh! Honey, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

10:35.259 --> 10:41.459
What can I do? You order me to make those martial art trick you used to like.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.959
I can call it Carl Meilong to find out how?

10:46.459 --> 10:49.459
Mom, I just don't understand. <br/>I thought you are happy.

10:50.159 --> 10:51.759
So did I.

10:52.159 --> 10:59.559
You know sometime you are driving on the highway, and you get home, and you can't actually remember you have driven there.

11:01.159 --> 11:03.259
That's kind of my life being like.

11:04.459 --> 11:06.359
Coundn't you listen to the radio more?

11:08.059 --> 11:14.459
I wish it is that easy. But then I see you here and I keep thinking why can't I have this?

11:14.459 --> 11:18.459
I want adventures, I want hang out, I want Chandler.

11:21.959 --> 11:25.459
Believe me, Chandler is no reason to leave daddy!

11:26.959 --> 11:32.459
You think it's something having a lot of fun, <br/>but it's really hard, really hard.

11:32.459 --> 11:37.459
I got this lausy job, I barely know how to make it ramdon. <br/>Forget about to buying stuff.

11:37.959 --> 11:43.959
Honey! You don't understand. <br/>I'm be doing what you are doning, but with money.

11:45.959 --> 11:47.459
It's very different.

11:52.807 --> 11:55.332
-You had no idea what they getting along? <br/>-None.

11:55.577 --> 11:57.044
They didn't fight a lot?

11:57.245 --> 11:59.975
No, they didn't even <br/>talk to each other.

12:00.181 --> 12:03.207
How was I suppose to know <br/>they were having problems?

12:04.519 --> 12:07.317
You know, in my day, <br/>divorce was not an option.

12:09.157 --> 12:10.385
Hey, look who's up!

12:13.261 --> 12:15.855
I just can't believe <br/>this is happening!

12:16.064 --> 12:18.760
When I was little, <br/>everybody's parents got divorced.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.094
I figured as an grown up, <br/>I wouldn't have to worry about it.

12:22.337 --> 12:25.238
Can't you look at this <br/>as flattering?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.499
She just wants to be like you.

12:27.742 --> 12:30.870
Well, couldn't she have just <br/>copied my haircut?

12:32.213 --> 12:35.080
When my parents divorced, <br/>they sent me to a shrink...

12:35.283 --> 12:38.343
...and she told me <br/>that kids blame themselves.

12:38.586 --> 12:41.350
But in your case, <br/>it's actually kind of true.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.552
Oh, that's him.

12:44.426 --> 12:47.589
Damn! My mail-order <br/>grandfather hasn't come yet.

12:48.797 --> 12:50.560
-Phoebe? <br/>-Hi, Mr. Adelman.

12:50.799 --> 12:52.733
-Nice to see you. <br/>-Thanks for meeting me.

12:52.934 --> 12:56.529
That's okay. Although you did <br/>cut into my busy day of sitting.

12:58.973 --> 13:00.270
Do you wanna sit?

13:00.542 --> 13:03.409
No, I spent most of my morning <br/>trying to stand up.

13:05.980 --> 13:07.777
What can I do <br/>for you, my dear?

13:08.049 --> 13:11.143
Okay, I don't know how <br/>to say this, but....

13:11.386 --> 13:14.116
I think when your wife's spirit <br/>left her body...

13:14.322 --> 13:16.813
...it kind of stuck around...

13:17.058 --> 13:17.956
...in me.

13:18.793 --> 13:20.920
You're saying <br/>my wife is in you?

13:21.162 --> 13:24.256
Yeah. You don't have to <br/>believe me, but...

13:24.466 --> 13:27.765
...can you think of <br/>any unfinished business she had?

13:27.969 --> 13:29.937
Any reason to hang around?

13:30.171 --> 13:31.798
I don't know what to say.

13:32.073 --> 13:34.303
All I can think of is that...

13:34.576 --> 13:38.512
...she used to say that before she died, <br/>she wanted to see everything.

13:39.147 --> 13:41.138
-Everything? <br/>-Everything.

13:41.749 --> 13:43.273
That's a lot of stuff.

13:43.485 --> 13:44.611
Oh, wait, l....

13:44.819 --> 13:48.778
I remember she also said she wanted <br/>to sleep with me one last time.

13:57.932 --> 14:00.958
I'm sorry. <br/>There's laughing in my head.

14:03.471 --> 14:04.938
Worth a shot, huh?

14:11.212 --> 14:12.839
Look at this!

14:13.314 --> 14:16.010
These are all Halloween, <br/>three years ago.

14:16.010 --> 14:19.517
My little matini. I love your oral of hair.

14:21.517 --> 14:23.348
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

14:23.653 --> 14:25.644
He came straight <br/>from the office?

14:25.888 --> 14:28.356
Oh, no. <br/>That was his costume.

14:29.825 --> 14:34.626
See, he's actually an orthodontist, <br/>but he came as a regular dentist.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.364
He thought that was really funny.

14:38.864 --> 14:39.888
You guys?

14:40.166 --> 14:43.067
Remember when I said <br/>that I don't need your help?

14:43.469 --> 14:44.959
Actually, I think you said...

14:45.171 --> 14:47.696
... "Don't touch that <br/>and get out of my kitchen."

14:48.507 --> 14:50.907
Really? Weird. <br/>Anyway....

14:52.044 --> 14:54.569
I planned really well. <br/>I planned and planned.

14:55.214 --> 14:57.705
I just didn't plan <br/>enough time to do it.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.741
-You want some help? <br/>-lf you want.

15:05.758 --> 15:06.986
What a day!

15:07.193 --> 15:08.888
I took her everywhere.

15:11.864 --> 15:14.890
The Museum of Modern Art, <br/>Rockefeller Center...

15:15.100 --> 15:16.567
...the Statue of Liberty.

15:16.769 --> 15:18.066
She's still with you?

15:18.337 --> 15:22.103
Yes. I guess she hasn't <br/>seen everything yet.

15:23.108 --> 15:26.077
Be right back. She has to go <br/>to the bathroom again.

15:28.347 --> 15:30.679
Such a pretty face!

15:34.253 --> 15:37.745
Oh, this is so much fun! <br/>Just the girls!

15:37.957 --> 15:41.723
Do you know what we should do? <br/>Does anybody have any marijuana?

15:42.027 --> 15:42.857
God!

15:44.457 --> 15:47.698
Did I have to ask do we have pot.

15:48.098 --> 15:51.261
Look, no one's smoking pot <br/>around all this food.

15:51.468 --> 15:53.299
Well, that's fine.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.437
I never did it. <br/>I just thought I might.

15:58.475 --> 15:59.737
What's new in sex?

16:02.579 --> 16:04.444
What's new in sex?

16:04.648 --> 16:07.139
The only man I've been with <br/>is your father.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.215
I'm dicing. I'm dicing. <br/>I don't hear anything.

16:10.787 --> 16:14.154
This is no offense to your dad, <br/>but I was thinking...

16:14.424 --> 16:15.652
...there might be more.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.225
You know what? I cannot <br/>have this conversation with you.

16:19.429 --> 16:20.396
All right.

16:20.597 --> 16:24.624
You come here and drop this bomb on me <br/>before you even tell Daddy.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.462
Do you want my blessing? <br/>Want me to talk you out of it?

16:28.672 --> 16:30.105
Then what do you want?

16:30.340 --> 16:32.638
I guess I figured <br/>you would understand.

16:32.843 --> 16:35.311
Why on earth <br/>would I understand this?

16:36.680 --> 16:39.240
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

16:39.449 --> 16:41.349
But I married mine.

16:48.025 --> 16:51.756
We're in trouble. We've only got <br/>12 hours and 36 minutes left.

16:51.995 --> 16:53.656
Move, move, move!

16:54.197 --> 16:57.132
I feel like you should <br/>have German subtitles.

16:59.369 --> 17:00.700
Joey, speed it up!

17:00.971 --> 17:04.839
I'm sorry! It's the pigs! <br/>They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

17:06.176 --> 17:09.441
How did this happen? <br/>I thought you had this planned out.

17:10.013 --> 17:11.776
Do you want me to cry?

17:12.849 --> 17:14.783
Is that what you want?

17:15.018 --> 17:16.849
Do you wanna see me cry?

17:17.621 --> 17:18.485
Sir, no, sir!

17:22.225 --> 17:23.214
All right, you!

17:23.493 --> 17:27.190
No. Look, I told you, <br/>I am not a part of this thing.

17:27.397 --> 17:31.800
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with <br/>Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

17:32.002 --> 17:35.062
But if you don't help, <br/>I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

17:35.305 --> 17:38.206
...and create an appetizer <br/>called "Pigs In Ross."

17:39.376 --> 17:40.809
All right, ball a melon!

17:41.044 --> 17:44.138
How come I'm stuck dicing <br/>when he gets to ball a melon?

17:49.519 --> 17:52.181
-How's it going? <br/>-Great! Right on schedule.

17:52.522 --> 17:54.717
Got my little happy helpers.

17:56.393 --> 17:57.883
That's fine. Whatever.

17:58.995 --> 17:59.893
What's wrong?

18:00.197 --> 18:01.095
Nothing.

18:02.666 --> 18:06.329
Okay, everything. <br/>I think we're calling off the wedding.

18:07.404 --> 18:09.702
You're still gonna pay me, right?

18:11.575 --> 18:14.203
Or something a little less selfish.

18:14.444 --> 18:16.412
What's the matter? <br/>What happened?

18:16.613 --> 18:19.514
My parents called to say <br/>they weren't coming.

18:20.117 --> 18:23.518
I knew they were <br/>having trouble with this, but...

18:23.754 --> 18:27.622
...they're my parents. <br/>They're supposed to give me away.

18:28.258 --> 18:32.058
Susan and I fought because <br/>I said maybe we should call it off.

18:32.295 --> 18:35.287
She said, "This isn't for them. <br/>It's for us."

18:35.532 --> 18:38.899
And if I couldn't see that, <br/>we should cancel the wedding.

18:39.102 --> 18:41.070
I don't know what to do.

18:43.140 --> 18:46.940
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, <br/>but I think Susan's right.

18:47.844 --> 18:48.776
You do?

18:49.780 --> 18:53.807
Do you love her? And don't be <br/>too emphatic about this.

18:56.086 --> 18:57.053
Of course I do.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.878
Well then, that's it.

18:59.122 --> 19:03.218
If George and Adelaide can't <br/>accept that, then the hell with them.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.559
If my parents didn't want me <br/>to marry you...

19:07.798 --> 19:09.732
... no way that would've <br/>stopped me.

19:11.468 --> 19:12.958
Look, this is your wedding.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.059
Do it.

19:18.175 --> 19:20.336
You're right. <br/>Of course you're right.

19:20.777 --> 19:21.971
So we're back on?

19:22.579 --> 19:23.739
We're back on.

19:23.980 --> 19:26.847
You heard the woman! <br/>Peel! Chop! Devil!

19:28.952 --> 19:31.250
Can't believe <br/>I lost two minutes!

19:41.998 --> 19:43.590
It just seems so futile.

19:43.867 --> 19:47.496
You know? <br/>All these women, and nothing!

19:50.106 --> 19:53.439
I feel like Superman <br/>without my powers, you know?

19:54.344 --> 19:57.939
I have the cape, <br/>and yet I cannot fly.

20:00.183 --> 20:03.550
Well, now you understand <br/>how I feel every single day.

20:05.055 --> 20:08.047
The world is my lesbian wedding.

20:19.236 --> 20:20.567
Butterscotch?

20:21.872 --> 20:23.169
No one?

20:23.406 --> 20:26.068
All right, <br/>you'll be sorry later.

21:00.944 --> 21:02.571
-Thank you. <br/>-Anytime.

21:06.416 --> 21:07.280
Ross.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.088
Nothing makes God happier...

21:14.291 --> 21:18.091
...than when two people, any two people, <br/>come together in love.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.729
Friends, family, <br/>we're gathered here today...

21:21.965 --> 21:24.525
...to join Carol and Susan <br/>in holy matrimony.

21:24.768 --> 21:26.099
Oh, my God!

21:26.436 --> 21:28.631
Now I've seen everything!

21:32.075 --> 21:33.474
She's gone!

21:33.710 --> 21:34.734
She's gone!

21:34.945 --> 21:35.877
She's gone.

21:36.112 --> 21:38.706
Go ahead, get married. <br/>Go, go!

21:40.483 --> 21:43.452
Strangers in the night

21:43.720 --> 21:45.984
Exchanging glances

21:46.222 --> 21:47.883
Wondering in the night

21:48.124 --> 21:49.455
Would you look at them?

21:49.726 --> 21:52.092
Yeah. Can't help but.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.567
How's that pig-in-the-blanket <br/>working out for you?

22:01.605 --> 22:03.664
I wrapped those bad boys.

22:05.442 --> 22:06.568
I miss Rose.

22:06.776 --> 22:07.640
Oh, yeah?

22:07.844 --> 22:12.679
I know it's kind of weird, but <br/>she was a big part of my life....

22:12.949 --> 22:14.644
I don't know, I feel alone.

22:15.485 --> 22:20.286
You know, I couldn't help <br/>overhearing what you just said.

22:21.191 --> 22:25.594
I think it's time you forget about Rose, <br/>move on with your life.

22:25.862 --> 22:27.489
How about we get you a drink?

22:27.697 --> 22:29.460
Okay. So nice!

22:37.641 --> 22:40.542
I shouldn't even bother <br/>coming up with a line, right?

22:43.647 --> 22:45.205
Hey, Mom, having fun?

22:45.515 --> 22:50.179
Am l! I just danced <br/>with a wonderfully large woman.

22:51.054 --> 22:54.512
And three other girls <br/>made eyes at me over at the buffet.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.282
I'm not saying <br/>it's something I wanna pursue...

22:57.560 --> 22:59.790
... but it's nice to know <br/>I have options.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.796
There's more alcohol, right?

23:09.706 --> 23:11.037
How you doing?

23:14.844 --> 23:16.903
You did a good thing today.

23:21.818 --> 23:22.842
You wanna dance?

23:23.420 --> 23:25.217
No, that's fine.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.182
Come on.

23:27.724 --> 23:29.589
I'll let you lead.

23:48.244 --> 23:49.871
Look, penis, schmenis!

23:50.180 --> 23:51.909
Okay? We're all people.

24:01.825 --> 24:05.454
Which one of us is gonna be <br/>the first one to get married?

24:05.995 --> 24:07.587
Mon, I was married.

24:07.797 --> 24:10.664
-Yeah, me too, technically. <br/>-I had a wedding.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.335
Just trying to <br/>start a discussion.

24:14.404 --> 24:18.067
Which one do you think <br/>will be the last to get married?

24:22.578 --> 24:23.909
Isn't Ben in this?

24:24.113 --> 24:24.977
Of course!

24:25.181 --> 24:26.045
Absolutely.
