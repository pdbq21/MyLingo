WEBVTT

00:02.402 --> 00:05.303
Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

00:05.972 --> 00:07.530
This bottle opener.

00:08.241 --> 00:10.732
-And...?
-And it's a magnet.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.581
Look at that!

00:18.485 --> 00:20.885
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me...

00:21.087 --> 00:24.215
and you have the one thing
I don't have.

00:24.924 --> 00:28.360
It's like, in a way,
you complete me.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.264
-Kitchen.
-What?

00:33.533 --> 00:36.093
You complete me kitchen, matey!

00:38.605 --> 00:40.232
I know what you're thinking.

00:41.207 --> 00:45.075
That she'll move in with you, then
fall in love with you, and then...

00:45.378 --> 00:49.041
when she finds out you're already
married, she'll be happy.

00:49.282 --> 00:52.183
You know? You're just very sad.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.947
Oh, my God!

00:56.856 --> 01:01.759
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel!

01:03.263 --> 01:06.994
It all adds up! You're obsessed
with her. It's always:

01:07.200 --> 01:11.193
"What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?

01:11.438 --> 01:16.239
When will you confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?" You want her!

01:19.145 --> 01:21.409
Saved by the bell.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.249
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

01:27.487 --> 01:28.784
No, I bought those.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.449
Oh, right. I forgot.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.616
That you're a liar!

01:36.229 --> 01:40.063
That's great! I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

01:42.335 --> 01:45.168
That was the head
of the paleontology department...

01:45.472 --> 01:46.598
at N...

01:46.806 --> 01:47.898
Y...

01:48.074 --> 01:49.234
U.

01:49.809 --> 01:51.106
Wow. What...

01:51.344 --> 01:52.333
did he...

01:52.645 --> 01:54.272
say?

01:55.348 --> 01:59.444
Remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

01:59.686 --> 02:02.154
-They loved it.
-Well, who wouldn't?

02:03.022 --> 02:04.148
I know!

02:06.192 --> 02:09.025
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

02:09.329 --> 02:13.823
It's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.501
How great would that look
on the mailbox? Professor Geller.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.498
Professor and Mrs.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.970
And Mrs.?

02:24.677 --> 02:26.804
You and Ross are still married.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.674
What?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.442
Just kidding!

02:35.054 --> 02:36.043
Oh, God!

02:40.860 --> 02:41.952
Saved your ass.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.298
The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance

03:24.270 --> 03:25.464
What's the matter?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.769
You know that psychic I see?

03:30.109 --> 03:33.408
She told me I'm gonna die this week,
so I'm bummed.

03:35.748 --> 03:40.811
I know you don't know about readings,
but that's the worst you can get.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.582
That's crazy.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.314
She'd say that to you?

03:45.592 --> 03:47.287
You don't believe her, do you?

03:47.493 --> 03:50.394
I don't know. She said
that I'd have triplets...

03:50.630 --> 03:53.394
but she also said one of them
would be black.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.593
Just out of curiosity,
did she say how you'd go?

03:57.804 --> 04:00.500
She didn't tell me I'd die
till the end of the session.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.173
I wasn't gonna waste
a whole other hour there!

04:03.409 --> 04:05.274
I've only got a week left.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.911
I've really gotta start living now!

04:12.185 --> 04:13.174
Hey, everyone.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.985
Well, today's my first lecture...

04:17.257 --> 04:20.192
and I wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.324
No, that'd be great!

04:35.341 --> 04:39.175
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

04:39.479 --> 04:43.006
Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two..."

04:43.283 --> 04:46.150
This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

04:49.022 --> 04:54.016
"...subcategories. The first
of these subcategories is.."

04:54.694 --> 04:57.390
Are there naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.122
No. Why?

05:01.367 --> 05:05.394
I never seen a guy stare so hard at
something that didn't have chicks on it.

05:13.513 --> 05:16.346
"There are three primary theories...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.585
concerning sediment flow rate.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.053
Each of these theories...

05:25.325 --> 05:28.226
can be further subcategorized...

05:28.394 --> 05:29.383
into.."

05:29.595 --> 05:31.654
Why don't you open with a joke?

05:33.032 --> 05:36.593
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.734
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.867
You're not talking
about Chuckles University?

05:44.510 --> 05:45.909
Come on, we're kidding.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.203
You know what might make it
less boring?

05:48.414 --> 05:49.506
Thank you.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.543
Some visual aids.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.449
-You know what's a good visual aid?
-Don't say naked chicks.

05:57.557 --> 05:58.888
Why not?

05:59.792 --> 06:02.522
I don't even know why I talk
to you guys about it.

06:02.795 --> 06:06.094
I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.994
That's the way I did it
till I was 19.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.495
All right, 20.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.205
Twenty-three.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.710
Any good mail?

06:24.917 --> 06:26.817
Something from
the Screen Actors Guild.

06:27.019 --> 06:31.149
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it? I got....

06:32.759 --> 06:34.590
"Benefits lapsed."

06:34.861 --> 06:35.987
That's weird.

06:36.195 --> 06:39.323
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.494
It's not a check. Your health
insurance expired because...

06:44.804 --> 06:48.262
-you didn't work enough last year.
-Let me see that.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.434
Oh, I can't believe this!

06:51.644 --> 06:52.975
This sucks!

06:53.880 --> 06:56.849
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus...

06:57.049 --> 06:58.846
or catch on fire, you know?

06:59.118 --> 07:01.882
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

07:03.289 --> 07:05.814
I'm sorry. There's never
a good time to have to...

07:06.125 --> 07:08.286
stop catching on fire.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.227
All right, well...

07:11.531 --> 07:13.829
I guess I gotta go see my agent.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.035
Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

07:17.904 --> 07:20.964
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street."

07:28.481 --> 07:30.346
Hey, you're still alive!

07:32.218 --> 07:33.515
How are you feeling?

07:33.719 --> 07:36.984
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

07:37.256 --> 07:40.191
Oh, by the way, do you think you..

07:43.830 --> 07:45.092
What are you doing?

07:45.765 --> 07:48.165
Preparing you for..
Didn't you think I was dead?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.096
Did that not come off?

07:51.037 --> 07:54.700
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.842
-You wanna lie down?
-Yeah, thanks.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.911
Can you do me a favor?

08:00.179 --> 08:02.272
Wake me up in a couple hours.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.380
You know, if you can.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.415
Did you take these back?

08:16.462 --> 08:19.454
I liked them so much
that I bought some for myself.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.894
They're really great, aren't they?

08:22.134 --> 08:23.192
I love them.

08:24.637 --> 08:25.763
Nice try.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.702
How'd the lecture go?

08:30.943 --> 08:32.934
It went great.

08:33.145 --> 08:37.081
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

08:37.383 --> 08:40.375
That's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.612
I knew I just had to let
the material speak for itself.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.950
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have
to be funny and sexy."

08:47.226 --> 08:49.387
Well, I proved them wrong!

08:50.496 --> 08:53.397
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.328
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-That's right!

09:01.974 --> 09:05.808
-Hey, Estelle, listen..
-Well, well, well.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.635
Joey Tribbiani.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.939
So you came back, huh?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.683
They think they can do better,
but they all...

09:12.952 --> 09:15.750
come crawling back to Estelle.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.247
What are you talking about?

09:19.692 --> 09:22.160
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.020
Really?

09:24.864 --> 09:27.992
Oh, well, no harm no foul.

09:28.601 --> 09:32.833
Look, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.370
All right, first thing we gotta do:
damage control.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.975
-Why?
-Well, I think...

09:39.211 --> 09:41.372
someone out there...

09:41.681 --> 09:45.014
may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.281
The bastard!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.060
We're early.
The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.593
-But we could sneak in and watch.
-Yeah, we could.

09:57.763 --> 10:01.722
Hey, look. There's some
Kappa Kappa Deltas. I was a Kappa.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.892
Hey, sisters.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.734
Wow, we really are bitches.

10:11.377 --> 10:15.780
Right. So when Rigby got his samples
back from the laboratory...

10:16.549 --> 10:19.382
he made a startling discovery.

10:20.987 --> 10:25.686
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.551
Imagine his consternation when..

10:33.366 --> 10:35.596
Oh, bloody hell.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.410
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

10:49.615 --> 10:52.584
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.316
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

11:01.661 --> 11:04.425
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

11:04.664 --> 11:09.260
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.528
And then I passed out...

11:12.805 --> 11:14.830
and I haven't been able
to stand up since.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.938
But I don't think
it's anything serious.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.011
This sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

11:21.313 --> 11:26.979
No way. If I go to the doctor, it'll be for
this thing sticking out of my stomach!

11:31.157 --> 11:32.385
That's a hernia.

11:32.658 --> 11:35.320
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

11:36.128 --> 11:37.891
Damn you, 15s!

11:40.266 --> 11:42.666
What the hell are you doing?

11:43.202 --> 11:44.829
Look, I was nervous.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.904
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.508
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

11:51.744 --> 11:55.510
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

11:56.348 --> 11:58.339
Yeah, and not a very good one.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.416
Will you, please...?

12:00.686 --> 12:02.517
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

12:02.788 --> 12:05.279
I'm a paleontology professor here.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.416
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

12:08.694 --> 12:11.458
I'm sorry, I've got plans
with my sister.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.699
Monica Geller.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.600
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

12:19.038 --> 12:21.768
-What are you doing?
-You can have an accent, but I can't?

12:22.408 --> 12:24.933
Top of the morning to you, laddies!

12:25.377 --> 12:27.868
Would you just please stop?

12:28.948 --> 12:33.146
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.802
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

12:53.639 --> 12:54.765
Sit down!

12:55.908 --> 12:58.001
Will you go to the hospital?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.972
Hernia operations cost...

13:00.246 --> 13:01.941
a lot probably, okay?

13:02.148 --> 13:06.744
Besides, it's getting darker and more
painful. That means it's healing.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.451
Look, I'll loan you the money.

13:09.688 --> 13:13.021
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing...

13:13.325 --> 13:14.815
pushed back in.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.656
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you back.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.922
I don't want that
hanging over my head.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.328
Besides, when my
insurance kicks in...

13:23.602 --> 13:26.469
I can get all the free
operations I want.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.764
I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

13:33.879 --> 13:34.868
What's going on?

13:35.147 --> 13:39.982
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
a little laser eye surgery won't fix.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.683
I'm telling you,
if I put my hand on my stomach...

13:43.956 --> 13:46.117
it doesn't hurt that bad.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.322
Hey, maybe you'll die!

13:50.863 --> 13:52.728
Chandler, I'm scared.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.724
No, we can go together.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.903
Just don't wait too long, because I'm
out of here sometime before Friday.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.563
But I don't want to die.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.037
It'll be fun. We'll come back
and haunt these guys!

14:06.679 --> 14:10.672
Wait. Could I come back and haunt Monica
and Rachel when they're in the shower?

14:11.951 --> 14:14.385
-That's my girlfriend.
-Hey, I'm dead!

14:20.593 --> 14:22.788
-Give me them!
-No, they are mine!

14:23.028 --> 14:25.087
-You stole them from me!
-You stole them from me!

14:25.297 --> 14:26.389
Give me them!

14:29.735 --> 14:31.066
Just wanna each take one?

14:31.804 --> 14:34.295
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.101
Look, I really need
some help, okay?

14:39.378 --> 14:42.745
Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

14:43.415 --> 14:44.404
What do I do?

14:44.583 --> 14:47.916
Why don't you call
Mummy and Daddy?

14:48.087 --> 14:52.114
I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out and
then they're never gonna offer me a job.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.418
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

14:54.593 --> 14:57.926
People will think you're
adjusting to life in America.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.355
Come on.
No one will even notice.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.091
They're probably not even
listening to you.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.627
They're not listening to me?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.466
Of course they're listening to you.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.441
Everybody listens to you.

15:12.044 --> 15:15.241
Monica, do you think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

15:15.547 --> 15:17.037
I think you look fine.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.644
Whenever you're ready.

15:24.623 --> 15:25.920
Hey, Timmy.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.560
I've got a surprise...

15:29.795 --> 15:30.921
for you.

15:31.463 --> 15:32.487
Hold it.
I'm sorry.

15:32.898 --> 15:36.834
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.969
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.069
Just hold on one second.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.837
Hey, Timmy.

15:50.082 --> 15:53.347
I've got a surprise for you!

15:53.619 --> 15:54.608
Oh, my God!

16:00.926 --> 16:04.157
So that's why I feed my dog
Purina One.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.491
Pick up a bag today.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.994
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.

16:12.171 --> 16:16.130
The line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

16:16.342 --> 16:19.368
Or I could just point to it.

16:20.713 --> 16:24.672
Purina One. Point to a bag today.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.321
I didn't get it, did I?

16:36.729 --> 16:38.196
Joey Tribbiani.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.728
I'm here to audition for "Man."

16:42.034 --> 16:43.160
You mean "Dying Man."

16:47.740 --> 16:50.868
-Do it one more time.
-Really? Really? Okay.

16:54.513 --> 16:59.041
Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely
from the Fake Accent University.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.718
We'd like you
to come onboard full-time!

17:07.226 --> 17:08.523
Listen to this!

17:09.194 --> 17:11.321
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.860
Really? How do you know?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.531
My psychic is dead!

17:16.769 --> 17:18.737
She must have read
the cards wrong.

17:19.004 --> 17:20.528
I'm sorry.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.434
Better her than me.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.010
Hey, let's bake cookies!

17:30.783 --> 17:33.081
Listen, I'm really glad
you got the part.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.683
Are you sure you can do this?

17:37.256 --> 17:39.087
And thanks for coming with me.

17:39.358 --> 17:42.259
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.964
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

17:50.135 --> 17:51.727
We're ready for you.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.065
This is Alex.
He'll be playing your son.

17:55.307 --> 17:56.399
Hi, Alex.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.600
As you can see, my hands
are not in my pants.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.443
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line...

18:07.753 --> 18:11.382
"Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

18:11.657 --> 18:13.090
All right, let's do this.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.624
Scene five, take one.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.428
And action!

18:22.634 --> 18:24.898
Take good care of your mama, son.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.273
Take good care of your mama, son.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.310
Come on, son.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.980
Your mama's good people.

18:43.856 --> 18:47.792
Cut! Alex, remember, you're
supposed to cry.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.153
Can you cry for us this time?

18:50.662 --> 18:52.630
All right. From the top.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.768
Scene five, take two.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.300
Take 36 is up.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.034
Let's try this again.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.535
You ready, Joe?

19:04.776 --> 19:07.472
One thing, is it all right
if I scream...

19:07.679 --> 19:09.613
right up until
you say, "Action"?

19:10.482 --> 19:11.949
Sure.

19:14.019 --> 19:17.113
-Action!
-Take good care of your mama, son.

19:19.858 --> 19:20.984
Cut!

19:22.161 --> 19:26.530
I'm sorry. Why don't you lift up your
shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.002
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

19:40.679 --> 19:43.170
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not. Can I take a message?

19:43.415 --> 19:45.883
Yes, this is Russell,
Ross' divorce lawyer.

19:46.151 --> 19:50.520
Since I haven't heard from him, I
assume he's giving the marriage a try.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.580
Ross got married again?

19:56.528 --> 19:59.827
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.692
Phasing it out.

20:02.434 --> 20:06.837
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory...

20:07.406 --> 20:10.569
the team would never
have identified...

20:13.245 --> 20:17.238
the initial errors
in their carbon dating...

20:17.516 --> 20:19.074
analysis."

20:21.353 --> 20:23.378
Were there any questions
at this point?

20:25.290 --> 20:27.258
What's happening to your accent?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.031
Come again? What's this nonsense?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.866
All right. I'm not English.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.407
I'm from Long lsland.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.369
I was really nervous,
and the accent...

20:47.579 --> 20:49.137
just came out.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.105
I'm sorry.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.920
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.918
Were there any questions?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.221
About paleontology?

21:07.633 --> 21:10.295
I was just trying to make
a good first impression.

21:10.569 --> 21:14.733
Obviously, I screwed up. But what
you guys think of me is important...

21:14.973 --> 21:17.999
because I'm hoping to get
a permanent job here.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.475
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression..

21:23.181 --> 21:25.308
Ross! Are you crazy?

21:25.584 --> 21:28.678
I am still your wife?
Were you just never gonna tell me?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.184
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.515
I could just kill you!

21:38.930 --> 21:40.625
Well, hello, Rachel!

21:49.107 --> 21:51.234
You've really done this before?

21:51.943 --> 21:54.537
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

21:54.780 --> 21:56.577
Now, don't hold back.

22:01.553 --> 22:02.542
What are you doing?

22:02.854 --> 22:06.381
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.248
Oh, all right.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.964
See? Now let's try one without the helmet.
