WEBVTT

00:04.368 --> 00:08.600
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.

00:08.806 --> 00:13.436
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?

00:13.644 --> 00:18.479
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?

00:18.782 --> 00:21.512
Yep, out like a light!

00:21.885 --> 00:25.343
This sure trumps
the "Has he pooped?" series.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.387
Ross, we love him, okay?

00:27.591 --> 00:30.651
But right now he's just
a little fat guy.

00:30.861 --> 00:32.385
How excited can we get?

00:34.932 --> 00:37.958
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.160
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!

00:42.439 --> 00:44.634
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

01:27.651 --> 01:29.949
Here's little Ben nodding off.

01:30.154 --> 01:32.884
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

01:33.090 --> 01:36.856
-Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
-Let me see.

01:37.261 --> 01:40.321
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

01:40.597 --> 01:43.828
You must just wanna kiss him all over.

01:47.504 --> 01:49.870
That would be nice.

01:52.976 --> 01:54.068
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

01:54.278 --> 01:56.906
Just a little extra air in my mouth.

02:01.885 --> 02:05.377
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.

02:05.589 --> 02:10.049
Right. Including the waffles
last week, you now owe me...

02:10.461 --> 02:12.691
...17 jillion dollars.

02:13.363 --> 02:17.925
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?

02:18.135 --> 02:21.593
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with research.

02:21.805 --> 02:23.432
What kind of research?

02:25.409 --> 02:27.468
Just, you know, science.

02:28.178 --> 02:29.805
Science.

02:31.715 --> 02:34.240
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.018
It's a fertility study.

02:39.456 --> 02:44.553
Joey, please tell me you're only
donating your time.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.924
Actually, a little more than that.

02:49.867 --> 02:54.429
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.

02:54.872 --> 02:57.534
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

02:57.741 --> 03:00.301
I just go down there
every other day...

03:00.511 --> 03:03.605
...and make my contribution
to the project.

03:03.814 --> 03:06.578
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

03:07.751 --> 03:11.016
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

03:13.090 --> 03:15.115
That's funny. Very funny.

03:15.659 --> 03:21.097
This is great. I actually know
somebody who loves what they do.

03:22.733 --> 03:27.363
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?

03:30.140 --> 03:32.631
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.

03:32.843 --> 03:37.246
The ground-up flesh
of formerly cute cows and turkeys.

03:38.482 --> 03:41.451
I just love barbecuing with you.

03:42.219 --> 03:44.210
Men are here!

03:49.393 --> 03:50.883
We make fire.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.520
Cook meat.

03:54.731 --> 03:57.723
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.

03:57.935 --> 03:59.300
Cute.

03:59.503 --> 04:02.404
-Melanie called. She'll be late.
-Okay.

04:02.606 --> 04:07.703
How are things going? Is she
becoming your "special someone"?

04:09.112 --> 04:12.013
I don't know. She's pretty great.

04:12.216 --> 04:15.982
What does she think of
your little science project?

04:16.787 --> 04:21.087
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

04:24.194 --> 04:25.684
Man's got a point.

04:25.963 --> 04:29.592
The tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.700
Crazy bitch.

04:36.873 --> 04:40.400
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules...

04:40.644 --> 04:46.173
...I can't conduct personal
experiments, if you know what I mean.

04:46.383 --> 04:50.046
Joey, we always know what you mean.

04:57.361 --> 05:00.853
How long did you think
this barbecue would last?

05:01.064 --> 05:05.592
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and...

05:06.303 --> 05:10.330
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.

05:10.540 --> 05:12.735
They don't want us to have it.

05:12.943 --> 05:18.381
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.

05:18.582 --> 05:20.982
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.

05:21.184 --> 05:26.486
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

05:27.557 --> 05:30.390
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

05:30.894 --> 05:35.957
Could you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?

05:36.400 --> 05:39.563
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father."

05:41.872 --> 05:44.033
"I am The Head!"

05:49.446 --> 05:52.415
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

05:52.616 --> 05:56.313
I wanted to wish Rachel
a happy birthday before I left.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.355
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?

06:04.061 --> 06:06.529
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

06:06.730 --> 06:11.292
-There's this guy she met at...
-The coffeehouse? Right.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.560
So you do know who he is.

06:17.407 --> 06:19.841
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.

06:20.043 --> 06:23.410
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

06:30.420 --> 06:33.753
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

06:34.825 --> 06:39.262
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

06:40.097 --> 06:41.792
Do you know who Carl is?

06:41.998 --> 06:46.458
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore...
No.

06:47.838 --> 06:50.534
Rachel's having
drinks with him tonight.

06:50.741 --> 06:54.370
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

06:55.078 --> 06:57.706
-Forget about her.
-He's right.

06:57.914 --> 07:00.883
Please move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.

07:01.385 --> 07:04.445
Of course, there
they just call it "food."

07:04.654 --> 07:08.283
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

07:08.558 --> 07:12.119
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

07:12.329 --> 07:15.924
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

07:16.133 --> 07:20.627
I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you.

07:22.472 --> 07:24.406
I'm still on my first.

07:27.344 --> 07:29.642
I just think you're nice.

07:36.319 --> 07:40.153
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.

07:40.357 --> 07:44.953
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers."

07:45.195 --> 07:48.596
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

07:54.938 --> 07:57.873
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!

07:58.074 --> 08:00.872
We're doing presents first.

08:02.446 --> 08:06.542
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?

08:06.750 --> 08:10.618
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...

08:10.821 --> 08:15.121
...complete the transaction,
if you know what... And you do.

08:15.325 --> 08:18.886
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?

08:19.362 --> 08:21.227
What do you mean?

08:24.734 --> 08:28.465
You know, just be there for her.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.304
Not following you.

08:35.445 --> 08:37.470
Think about it.

08:41.718 --> 08:47.520
Okay. I'm guessing this is from...

08:50.060 --> 08:53.621
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.

08:53.830 --> 08:58.733
Okay. It's light. It rattles.

08:58.969 --> 08:59.958
It's...

09:01.638 --> 09:03.936
...Travel Scrabble!

09:07.143 --> 09:08.906
Thank you.

09:12.415 --> 09:14.042
This one's from Joey.

09:14.251 --> 09:19.052
It feels like a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!

09:19.256 --> 09:21.156
It's Dr. Seuss!

09:22.292 --> 09:25.853
That book got me through
some tough times.

09:26.429 --> 09:29.057
There's a little child
inside this man.

09:29.266 --> 09:32.963
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

09:35.138 --> 09:37.231
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.

09:43.380 --> 09:47.544
Oh, my God! He remembered!

09:47.984 --> 09:50.680
-Remembered what?
-It was months ago.

09:50.954 --> 09:54.390
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.

09:54.658 --> 09:59.322
I told him it was like one
my grandma had when I was little.

09:59.563 --> 10:02.031
I can't believe he remembered!

10:02.232 --> 10:05.827
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

10:10.840 --> 10:14.708
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.

10:14.911 --> 10:16.071
I can't believe it.

10:16.279 --> 10:19.271
Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

10:19.482 --> 10:22.940
...and bought her that
expensive crystal duck?

10:23.420 --> 10:25.684
What did you just say?

10:37.233 --> 10:39.167
Crystal duck.

10:42.906 --> 10:48.538
No, no, no. The "love" part?

10:54.818 --> 11:00.723
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.

11:01.558 --> 11:06.621
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'll turn back time.

11:12.902 --> 11:16.338
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

11:16.539 --> 11:19.167
I know.
This is really, really huge.

11:19.376 --> 11:23.836
No, it's not. It's small.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

11:24.047 --> 11:29.041
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.016
Is there a mute button on this woman?

11:33.223 --> 11:36.852
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!

11:37.060 --> 11:40.029
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!

11:40.230 --> 11:44.098
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

11:44.300 --> 11:46.291
...but nothing ever happened.

11:46.503 --> 11:49.666
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?

11:49.873 --> 11:52.307
Given that he's in love with you...

11:52.509 --> 11:55.910
...he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.

11:56.279 --> 12:01.239
Ross? All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.420
-He's in China!
-The country.

12:07.691 --> 12:09.124
Is his flight gone?

12:09.325 --> 12:12.385
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

12:12.595 --> 12:13.584
He's gone!

12:13.797 --> 12:16.493
His flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.602
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?

12:21.805 --> 12:24.365
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.

12:24.574 --> 12:26.565
What'll you say to him?

12:26.776 --> 12:29.438
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.

12:29.646 --> 12:33.309
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

12:33.616 --> 12:35.607
But if it's good, tell him now.

12:35.819 --> 12:40.654
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?

12:46.629 --> 12:51.965
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.

12:52.168 --> 12:56.264
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.

12:56.473 --> 13:00.136
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!

13:12.622 --> 13:13.611
All right.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.625
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?

13:22.832 --> 13:24.766
I need to talk to my friend.

13:24.968 --> 13:28.904
Sorry, you're not allowed here
without a pass.

13:29.105 --> 13:32.336
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I?

13:32.542 --> 13:34.510
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

13:34.711 --> 13:38.670
Then could you please
just give him a message for me?

13:38.982 --> 13:42.941
-This is very important.
-All right. What's the message?

13:44.020 --> 13:45.749
I don't know.

13:47.690 --> 13:52.457
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.

13:52.695 --> 13:56.995
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.827
What?

13:59.803 --> 14:02.863
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

14:03.173 --> 14:07.507
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.

14:16.352 --> 14:20.812
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

14:21.024 --> 14:24.619
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

14:25.662 --> 14:27.687
It was nothing.

14:27.897 --> 14:31.890
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you.

14:35.371 --> 14:36.838
You know what?

14:38.741 --> 14:42.404
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

14:44.981 --> 14:48.815
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?

14:51.421 --> 14:57.417
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

15:01.264 --> 15:06.395
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you'd be.

15:06.603 --> 15:07.968
How do you mean?

15:08.171 --> 15:12.608
I had you pegged as a guy
who's always, "Me, me, me!"

15:12.876 --> 15:16.073
But you, you're a giver.

15:17.513 --> 15:20.311
You're the most generous man
I ever met.

15:20.516 --> 15:23.542
I mean, you're practically a woman.

15:31.494 --> 15:34.725
-You're just saying that.
-No.

15:36.366 --> 15:38.061
<i>A woman!</i>

15:48.912 --> 15:51.278
-So?
-I missed him.

15:51.481 --> 15:53.915
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.

15:54.117 --> 15:55.778
Yeah, right.

15:56.452 --> 15:58.545
No, I feel bad for her. I do.

15:58.755 --> 16:02.191
I can think of somebody
other than myself.

16:02.392 --> 16:04.451
All right, I'm going to bed.

16:06.062 --> 16:09.463
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.

16:10.433 --> 16:11.422
Yes!

16:13.836 --> 16:15.167
Pizza coupons.

16:20.143 --> 16:24.102
Okay. You guys want help
cleaning up this mess?

16:24.314 --> 16:25.872
That'd be great.

16:29.185 --> 16:32.416
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?

16:32.622 --> 16:37.423
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or should I throw it out?

16:40.296 --> 16:44.255
I don't know. I don't know.

16:44.467 --> 16:46.958
Thought about it
all the way there...

16:47.170 --> 16:52.073
...and I thought about it all the way
back. You know, it's Ross!

16:52.275 --> 16:54.675
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

16:54.877 --> 16:56.606
-Sure!
-Sure.

16:56.813 --> 17:02.012
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

17:02.552 --> 17:06.579
...but I'm thinking
it'd be really great.

17:06.789 --> 17:10.384
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!

17:11.661 --> 17:14.824
The best part is you already
know all about him.

17:15.031 --> 17:17.158
You start on the 15th date.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.768
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date.

17:21.671 --> 17:23.571
Another good point.

17:23.773 --> 17:28.005
I mean, on the 15th date,
you're already in a very...

17:28.211 --> 17:31.442
..."relationship-y" place.
You're committed.

17:34.951 --> 17:37.351
What happens if it doesn't work out?

17:37.553 --> 17:40.522
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.

17:40.757 --> 17:44.488
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?

17:44.694 --> 17:47.663
-No, I'm just...
-Maybe there's someone else.

17:47.864 --> 17:52.528
-Is there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.

17:52.735 --> 17:55.363
Then why are you dumping my brother?

18:06.015 --> 18:08.711
Hey, big... Spender!

18:11.654 --> 18:13.212
She's still asleep.

18:13.523 --> 18:18.153
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?

18:18.361 --> 18:22.388
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

18:22.598 --> 18:27.433
Last night I couldn't do the thing
that usually makes me great.

18:27.637 --> 18:30.071
So I had to do all this other stuff.

18:30.273 --> 18:33.071
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

18:33.309 --> 18:36.335
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

18:37.413 --> 18:42.316
I know. My room's very, very close
to the parade route.

18:46.823 --> 18:50.418
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!

18:50.660 --> 18:53.857
It's like, all of a sudden
I'm blind...

18:54.063 --> 18:56.861
...but all my other senses
are heightened.

18:57.066 --> 18:59.967
It's like I was able
to appreciate it...

19:00.269 --> 19:02.203
...on another level.

19:04.774 --> 19:09.711
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know. Neither did I!

19:11.714 --> 19:14.649
Is something going on with O.J.?

19:25.061 --> 19:27.586
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

19:27.797 --> 19:28.957
-From who?
-You.

19:29.165 --> 19:31.861
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

19:33.102 --> 19:34.694
Well, it's the thought.

19:35.538 --> 19:39.907
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

19:41.444 --> 19:45.813
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

19:46.048 --> 19:49.313
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

19:49.519 --> 19:50.508
Why?

19:50.720 --> 19:54.315
I feel like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

19:54.524 --> 19:58.324
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure...

19:58.561 --> 20:00.358
No pressure, no pressure!

20:02.064 --> 20:04.897
Nothing has happened,
and you're already so...

20:05.101 --> 20:09.060
I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...

20:09.272 --> 20:12.400
...but I'll be good. I promise.

20:17.413 --> 20:19.938
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.

20:20.249 --> 20:23.047
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?

20:24.921 --> 20:29.984
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

20:42.038 --> 20:45.269
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!

20:45.474 --> 20:47.772
Do we have any fruit?

20:50.046 --> 20:51.946
Man, hell of a two weeks.

20:52.215 --> 20:55.150
You know what?
I feel I learned something.

20:55.351 --> 20:57.945
You'll stick with this
"all for her" thing?

20:58.187 --> 20:59.779
What are you, crazy?

21:00.289 --> 21:05.317
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

21:10.032 --> 21:13.729
If I see one more picture
of Ed Begley Jr...

21:13.970 --> 21:18.464
...in that stupid electric car,
I'm gonna shoot myself!

21:19.575 --> 21:23.443
I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

21:23.646 --> 21:25.307
...it's just that guy!

21:25.748 --> 21:29.741
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

21:30.186 --> 21:33.178
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.

21:33.656 --> 21:36.750
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

21:39.328 --> 21:41.489
Can't do it, can you?

21:42.265 --> 21:44.597
I'm thinking about you. So what?

21:44.834 --> 21:47.997
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?

21:49.171 --> 21:51.662
Happens to be a very nice guy.

21:51.874 --> 21:55.002
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

21:57.947 --> 22:01.644
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

22:02.351 --> 22:03.943
Ross, it's too hard.

22:04.153 --> 22:08.852
Why, because it'll get weird
for everyone else? This is about us.

22:09.058 --> 22:12.494
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

22:12.795 --> 22:17.494
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you...

22:17.700 --> 22:19.497
What makes you think that?

22:19.735 --> 22:24.035
Have you been involved
where you haven't broken up?

22:26.108 --> 22:27.097
No.

22:27.943 --> 22:31.743
But it only has to happen once.

22:32.014 --> 22:36.747
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?

22:36.952 --> 22:41.321
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

22:42.425 --> 22:44.393
I don't know.

22:45.895 --> 22:48.864
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

22:49.632 --> 22:51.259
Well, start looking.

23:02.111 --> 23:04.136
-Wow.
-Exactly!

23:04.380 --> 23:06.314
And I'm gonna be the guy...

23:06.582 --> 23:09.813
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

23:12.054 --> 23:14.716
Right! You're right.

23:15.558 --> 23:16.616
You know what?

23:16.826 --> 23:20.159
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

23:20.396 --> 23:22.421
I am so sorry!

23:22.665 --> 23:25.862
If you wanna finish your drinks,
please do.

23:26.068 --> 23:29.560
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But...

23:34.910 --> 23:37.811
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.

23:38.013 --> 23:40.379
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.

23:40.583 --> 23:44.917
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.

23:45.388 --> 23:50.917
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

23:52.228 --> 23:54.059
Hello!

23:57.566 --> 23:59.431
-Where you going?
-Airport.

23:59.668 --> 24:02.933
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.

24:03.139 --> 24:06.108
I haven't watched <i>Baywatch</i>
with Yasmine Bleeth!

24:07.743 --> 24:11.679
Chandler, relax. This is a good
going to the airport.

24:12.214 --> 24:15.911
Oh, well then fly, good woman,
fly like the wind.

24:16.118 --> 24:19.087
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!

24:20.556 --> 24:25.323
Yes, another successful case
for the love doctor.

24:33.636 --> 24:36.969
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

24:37.740 --> 24:40.868
Toby, for God's sake,
will you let it go?

24:41.143 --> 24:42.610
There's no Rachel!

24:47.550 --> 24:50.485
Hey! I got that.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.181
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

24:59.128 --> 25:01.790
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

25:01.997 --> 25:04.693
You don't think they'll judge me?

25:04.900 --> 25:07.664
-No, they will. I just...
-Can't wait!

25:07.870 --> 25:10.361
Come on, they're gonna love you.
