WEBVTT

00:04.071 --> 00:06.164
Hey! You're not gonna believe this.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.743
Yes, Ross, we know they have magazines
with pictures of naked women in them.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.970
Don't tell him about the videos!

00:14.414 --> 00:17.144
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.941
They printed it.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.312
I didn't know they print jokes.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.321
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.324
It's not just about the pictures.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.053
Didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

00:32.099 --> 00:34.329
Check it out. It's the first one.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.099
Right there.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.968
That is funny.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.334
It was also funny when I made it up.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.480
-What?
-I made that joke up.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.581
No, you didn't. I did.

00:49.783 --> 00:54.277
Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.512
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.086
What?

01:02.296 --> 01:06.027
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

01:08.468 --> 01:11.699
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

01:12.139 --> 01:13.766
-No.
-Seriously?

01:14.207 --> 01:16.038
You tell a lot of jokes.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.038
Look, it's my joke.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.714
But if it makes you feel better,
they don't print the name.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.383
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.984
Yeah, I guess.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.520
-Hey, guys.
-Playboy printed my joke!

01:29.723 --> 01:32.556
No, it's mine! Call them!
They'll tell you!

01:32.826 --> 01:33.850
-My joke!
-My joke!

01:34.161 --> 01:35.526
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:35.796 --> 01:37.593
Jokes? What...?

01:37.798 --> 01:40.358
You know there's naked chicks
in there, right?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.796
The One With The Joke

02:20.774 --> 02:23.538
Dude! You have got to turn on
Behind The Music.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.372
The band Heart is having a tough
time and they may break up.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.582
Let's watch that at your place.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.219
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.412
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?

02:36.723 --> 02:40.284
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.959
What? No, I want to watch this.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.496
-Did your cable go out?
-No. No, that's VH1.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.600
I tell you, the music
these kids listen to today...

02:52.806 --> 02:54.296
it's a lot of noise to me.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.239
Why is your cable out?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.075
Oh, because I haven't really
paid the bill.

03:02.582 --> 03:05.779
If you need money,
would you please let me loan you some?

03:06.086 --> 03:08.452
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

03:08.689 --> 03:12.648
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.688
I know, yeah.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.920
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.158
And Ross gave me this great book.

03:22.969 --> 03:26.598
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch at his place?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.102
Sure.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.677
-Paid your phone bill?
-No.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.516
It's only you.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.885
-What are you doing?
-Looking at a Playboy.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.286
I want to look too!

03:51.565 --> 03:52.896
Yikes!

03:54.501 --> 03:57.868
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

03:58.472 --> 04:01.134
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman...

04:01.408 --> 04:03.638
she has lost her clothes.

04:03.877 --> 04:08.871
So she rides naked on the horse,
she's crying out, "Where are they?"

04:10.150 --> 04:13.517
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.716
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn...

04:20.994 --> 04:23.087
Lift up your shirt and bend over?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.395
You see, now, I would date this girl.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.232
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.668
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.401
I got a question.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.271
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

04:43.216 --> 04:44.843
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.450
Rachel.

04:47.587 --> 04:48.611
What?

04:50.223 --> 04:52.123
I don't know.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.190
Me neither.

04:58.031 --> 05:02.092
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.738
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.471
So you heard it, you repeated it...

05:11.745 --> 05:14.441
so that must mean you wrote it.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.247
You guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say...

05:19.553 --> 05:22.283
I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

05:22.722 --> 05:23.950
What?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.955
You didn't get it?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.889
The doctor is a monkey.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.556
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.763
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.071
Your joke?

05:40.307 --> 05:43.174
Well, I think the Hef
would disagree.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.774
Which is why he sent me a check...

05:45.979 --> 05:48.174
for $100.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.748
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

05:52.085 --> 05:54.019
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.188
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller...

05:57.424 --> 06:00.257
that I am a published writer.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.655
She'll know that you stole the joke.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.419
You gonna follow me there?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.462
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.

06:06.666 --> 06:07.997
Okay.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.169
Here you go.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.502
Gunther?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.511
I can't pay now,
because I'm not working.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.373
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like...

06:22.616 --> 06:25.107
paying for stuff, so....

06:26.786 --> 06:28.845
Well, if you want, you can work here.

06:29.689 --> 06:30.951
I don't know.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.454
It's just....

06:32.893 --> 06:36.158
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

06:36.363 --> 06:39.298
And to go from that to this,
it's just....

06:39.566 --> 06:42.330
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.329
Okay. But the money's good.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.404
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.373
What?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.671
Flexible hours.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.712
Maybe I could be a waiter.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.348
Could I use the phone?

07:05.692 --> 07:06.989
She picked Rachel.

07:07.193 --> 07:11.596
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.931
He took my joke. He just took it.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.431
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.401
Phoebe picking Rachel.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.539
Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.609
Know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.613
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

07:29.883 --> 07:33.284
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.784
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

07:36.056 --> 07:38.354
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.561
Did you hear something?

07:42.762 --> 07:46.892
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain to steal my thoughts.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.795
It's coming from the living room.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.270
I finished my book.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.485
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.779
Don't you guys look cute.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.951
You guys make a cute couple.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.093
What are you doing?

08:15.328 --> 08:19.389
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.930
Remember? When you picked
Rachel over me?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.160
That was funny.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.498
-It was kind of funny.
-It wasn't funny at all!

08:29.075 --> 08:30.667
Why would you do that?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.844
Why didn't you pick me?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.444
Fine.

08:34.781 --> 08:38.774
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you...

08:38.985 --> 08:40.850
is just, you know, you're...

08:41.521 --> 08:43.648
high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!

08:43.923 --> 08:46.289
That is completely untrue.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.824
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.656
You write out a list, and
we'll go through it point by point.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.961
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

08:58.838 --> 09:02.501
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more...

09:02.776 --> 09:05.006
flexible and mellow. That's all.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.643
Well, people are different.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.779
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.826
What? Are you saying that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

09:21.127 --> 09:24.221
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.666
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.733
You're not invited to lunch!

09:30.970 --> 09:33.461
What do you think?
Pretty strong, I think.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.970
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.305
You start working on that list.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.743
-I cannot believe her.
-I know. Where do you want to eat?

09:46.753 --> 09:50.553
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.224
Wherever you want to go is cool.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.526
Oh, hey, Gunther...

09:59.833 --> 10:01.357
check this out.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.561
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.735
You want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.344
-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
-Sure.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.178
-Coffee?
-No.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.976
Coffee? I'm going up there.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.414
No, thank you.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.390
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.189
I'd love ice water.

10:27.393 --> 10:28.883
You got it.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.594
What are you doing?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.230
Just being friendly.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.926
You're not supposed to go back there.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.569
It's okay. Right?

10:41.407 --> 10:43.068
Don't wink at me.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.212
And put on your apron.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.410
Okay.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.312
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.385
-Joey, do you work here?
-No.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.114
-Waiter.
-Yeah!

11:02.495 --> 11:05.396
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

11:08.902 --> 11:13.134
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.569
It's supposed to go
the other direction.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.938
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.408
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

11:23.616 --> 11:27.575
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it.

11:27.787 --> 11:31.120
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

11:31.324 --> 11:32.450
It'll be great.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.125
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.886
Why would it be weird?

11:37.096 --> 11:40.088
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.293
It doesn't seem that weird.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.233
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.136
See, now it's weird again.

11:50.843 --> 11:54.279
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.843
Don't eat yellow snow.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.015
2:15, coffeehouse.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.121
This is great. Finally,
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.262
Let me tell you some things
I learned working here.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.523
First, the customer is always right.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.259
A smile goes a long way.

12:20.006 --> 12:23.669
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.703
Thanks, Rach.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.449
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

12:31.684 --> 12:34.778
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers?

12:34.988 --> 12:37.047
It's all about turnover.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.227
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

12:43.796 --> 12:45.821
I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.

12:46.332 --> 12:49.165
And since you waited,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.566
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.405
Okay.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.739
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.883
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.813
But you know what you are?

13:08.054 --> 13:11.751
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.059
That's true, I am flaky.

13:18.531 --> 13:22.160
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.994
Yeah, totally.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.396
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.508
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.071
That's great. Good for you guys.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.510
-I am not high maintenance!
-I am not a pushover!

13:38.017 --> 13:40.247
-Who said you were?
-You did!

13:40.453 --> 13:42.887
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.359
Hey, Gunther.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.929
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.734
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.434
I like your natural color.

14:01.974 --> 14:05.410
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.977
I wait for him and save his seat.
Listen.

14:08.981 --> 14:11.313
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."

14:13.486 --> 14:17.582
-That's the whole part?
-Maybe he's not his best friend.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.050
I'll see you.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.951
Oh, man.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.961
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken."

14:26.232 --> 14:29.497
-Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.066
But you believed me?

14:31.938 --> 14:35.101
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.466
So you'd hire me, right?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.342
For what?

14:40.913 --> 14:43.609
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

14:43.816 --> 14:46.580
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.946
What?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.821
It's for the kids.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.787
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

14:54.026 --> 14:57.621
It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.695
I'm sure you all read about it.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.895
Hey! Don't you wanna keep guns
away from kids?

15:06.072 --> 15:09.235
-You said, "drugs."
-It's a vicious cycle. Get out!

15:12.078 --> 15:13.602
Go!

15:25.391 --> 15:27.621
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.661
It's my joke.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.498
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.399
Let's have Monica decide.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.664
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!

15:41.908 --> 15:43.876
-Monica?
-Okay.

15:44.076 --> 15:46.408
You have to decide whose joke this is.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.670
Why do I have to?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.041
You're the only one that can be fair.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.181
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.512
But I'm your brother. We're family.

15:54.754 --> 15:58.554
That's the most important thing
in the world.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.357
Don't try to sway her.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.596
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.902
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.765
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke...

16:15.041 --> 16:19.000
then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.907
Chandler, you first.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.547
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.275
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?

16:27.553 --> 16:29.020
You want me to pick you?

16:30.256 --> 16:33.555
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.919
Two babies.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.096
-Continue.
-Okay.

16:43.302 --> 16:48.035
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

16:48.307 --> 16:53.301
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.275
Are you kidding?

16:59.986 --> 17:02.420
Okay, look, I study evolution.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.054
Remember? Evolution.

17:04.323 --> 17:05.881
Monkey into man.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.786
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...

17:08.060 --> 17:11.052
I had a monkey.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.132
I'm Dr. Monkey!

17:17.904 --> 17:20.236
I'm not arguing with that.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.598
I've heard enough for my decision.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.434
-Okay, so what..?
-Do tell.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.907
You are both idiots.

17:28.514 --> 17:31.142
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.477
And doctors. And monkeys.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.013
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

17:37.290 --> 17:42.159
You should argue over who gets blamed
for inflicting this joke on the world.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.793
Now, let it go.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.157
The joke sucks.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.635
-It's your joke.
-It is not.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.547
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
-Hi.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.317
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.959
Why don't you tell them...

18:17.163 --> 18:20.690
what you told me about me
not being high maintenance.

18:23.502 --> 18:27.370
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.143
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.411
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance...

18:37.717 --> 18:40.311
is merely attention to detail...

18:40.519 --> 18:41.884
and...

18:43.022 --> 18:45.320
generosity of spirit.

18:47.193 --> 18:51.892
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.859
Really? I've heard better.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.994
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.262
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

19:01.574 --> 19:03.508
Look, I am not high maintenance!

19:03.776 --> 19:05.607
I am not. Chandler!

19:08.280 --> 19:10.339
You're a little high maintenance.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.744
You are on my list!

19:14.353 --> 19:16.344
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not..

19:16.555 --> 19:19.353
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.854
And that's good.

19:21.093 --> 19:24.961
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good...

19:25.231 --> 19:27.062
at making you feel better.

19:27.299 --> 19:30.234
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance...

19:30.469 --> 19:33.097
but it's okay, because I like...

19:34.807 --> 19:36.798
maintaining you.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.541
I didn't tell him that.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.486
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.154
Phoebe?

19:56.395 --> 19:59.558
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.494
I have the best boyfriend.

20:02.935 --> 20:06.462
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.132
How'd the audition go?

20:11.410 --> 20:12.775
Oh, not good. No.

20:12.978 --> 20:16.675
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so...

20:16.916 --> 20:18.816
Wow, that is a bad audition.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.511
Well, how did you lose your job here?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.086
I had the audition...

20:25.291 --> 20:28.920
but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.288
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.432
He left work
to do a personal errand...

20:34.633 --> 20:37.966
and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

20:38.204 --> 20:39.501
That's not right.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.905
What are you gonna do?

20:42.108 --> 20:44.804
You can't let him get away with that.

20:45.044 --> 20:48.172
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say..

20:48.447 --> 20:51.712
I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!

20:55.054 --> 20:58.148
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

20:58.457 --> 21:02.120
-It's not fair that you have to fire..
-Okay.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.232
-What?
-He can have his job back.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.704
That's right,
he can have his job back.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.707
Glad we got that all straightened out.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.375
There you go, Joey.

21:19.578 --> 21:23.014
-Got your job back.
-That's great. Thanks.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.082
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

21:26.819 --> 21:29.014
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.354
I never heard who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.988
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-Yeah, definitely you, Phoebe.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.792
Yeah, I kind of thought.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.133
-Never.
-It would totally be you.

21:51.377 --> 21:54.710
If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with...

21:54.980 --> 21:56.413
who would you pick?

21:56.715 --> 21:58.046
-No way.
-I'm not answering.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.807
Joey.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.315
No way, I'm not answering that.
