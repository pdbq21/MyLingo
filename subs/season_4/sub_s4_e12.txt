WEBVTT

00:14.014 --> 00:16.539
What the hell is that?!

00:19.452 --> 00:22.421
What the hell is that?
Is that you?

00:29.362 --> 00:32.593
-You're really not a morning person.
-Just back off!

00:35.168 --> 00:37.102
Get up! Get up! Get up!

00:42.442 --> 00:44.603
What is that noise?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.209
You!

00:48.648 --> 00:50.707
It's the chick.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.145
She's going through some changes.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.720
What kind of changes?

00:55.989 --> 00:57.980
The vet seems to think...

00:58.191 --> 01:00.489
...she's becoming a rooster.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.224
We're getting a second opinion.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.191
The One With the Embryos

01:56.249 --> 01:58.740
Why are you shopping
at 8 in the morning?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.476
I've been up since 6...

02:00.687 --> 02:03.315
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

02:04.190 --> 02:08.286
You should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

02:08.595 --> 02:11.894
Especially not with these
knives and cookbooks around.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.934
I'm going to the doctor
and see if I'm ready...

02:17.137 --> 02:21.437
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.436
How will they know?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.977
They'll just see if my
endometrial layer is thick.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.741
I can check that for you.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.950
Okay, think "thick."

02:33.319 --> 02:34.946
Good luck!

02:36.456 --> 02:37.445
Wish me luck.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.248
Good luck.

02:39.459 --> 02:42.758
-I'm still right.
-That is so not true.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.088
What?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.696
I know it's her laundry day...

02:46.900 --> 02:50.563
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.929
I can check that for you.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.541
You two think you know
me and Rachel...

02:57.777 --> 02:59.472
...better than we know you.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.475
Well, we do.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.951
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.117
What's that about?

03:08.788 --> 03:11.814
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...

03:12.058 --> 03:14.891
...you'll find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.659
You're good.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.764
These are not.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.728
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.933
Ross, how many items
left in that bag?

03:31.144 --> 03:32.133
Five.

03:32.512 --> 03:37.108
Okay, 10 bucks says we can
name every item in that bag.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.409
-How many guesses?
-Six.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.212
Challenge extended.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.719
-Deal!
-Challenge accepted.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.554
All right, we'll start with...

03:51.397 --> 03:52.386
...apples.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.657
We'll be starting with apples.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.704
Stop that now.

04:01.674 --> 04:02.663
Yes.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.206
Okay. Tortilla chips.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.935
-Yogurt.
-Diet soda.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.984
-Orange juice.
-There's no orange juice! We win!

04:15.555 --> 04:17.318
They have another guess.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.155
Well, we won that one.

04:21.294 --> 04:23.421
Okay. The last thing is

04:27.533 --> 04:30.297
Not for another two weeks.

04:33.539 --> 04:34.563
I got it.

04:34.707 --> 04:35.935
Scotch...

04:36.109 --> 04:37.133
...tape.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.240
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

04:45.451 --> 04:48.386
We used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.217
Oh, man!

04:51.424 --> 04:54.052
All right! Ten bucks.
Fork it over.

04:54.327 --> 04:57.262
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.157
Give me it!

05:00.366 --> 05:03.062
You don't know us better.
I want a rematch.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.567
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real, personal questions.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.330
And the winner gets $100.

05:09.842 --> 05:13.369
-Serious?
-Are you scared?

05:14.781 --> 05:15.907
No.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.415
Who makes up the questions?

05:19.686 --> 05:20.846
Ross will do it.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.782
Sure, Ross will do it.

05:24.090 --> 05:28.083
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.627
-Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.
-No, I want to play.

05:37.136 --> 05:40.071
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.800
I knew it!
I felt really thick this morning.

05:44.243 --> 05:48.236
Okay, so what's now?
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.813
It'll take a little while
to prepare the embryos.

05:52.118 --> 05:56.020
-Embryos? As in more than one?
-Five, actually.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.347
Where am I giving birth...

05:58.558 --> 06:01.356
...in a hospital or
a big box under the stairs?

06:01.728 --> 06:06.290
Doing five gives you a 25% chance
that at least one will attach.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.397
That's it? 25%?

06:08.634 --> 06:12.400
That means that it's, like,
75% chance of no baby at all?

06:12.605 --> 06:14.800
I was thinking,
what are the odds...

06:15.041 --> 06:17.601
...if you stuff 200 of them in there?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.509
Sweetie, now...

06:20.780 --> 06:23.647
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

06:26.386 --> 06:31.221
Don't worry. I'll do this as many
times as it takes to get it right.

06:31.491 --> 06:34.983
The thing is, we kind of
only have one shot.

06:35.795 --> 06:39.231
It costs $16,000 each time you do this.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.056
Sixteen thousand dollars?!

06:42.201 --> 06:46.228
Well, it's 20 in California.

06:47.173 --> 06:51.542
We're kind of using all the money
we have to do it this one time.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.709
Okay, that's a lot of
pressure on me and my uterus.

06:59.318 --> 07:04.187
Maybe there's something I can do
to make sure I get pregnant.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.755
No, I'm sorry.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.619
Wow, you guys really
don't know anything.

07:10.062 --> 07:14.863
Why don't you get drunk? It worked
for a bunch of girls in my high school.

07:22.074 --> 07:26.204
-So how's the test coming?
-Hey, you're touching the game board.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.607
Sorry.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.909
You freak.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.779
Do you realize that
any minute now...

07:36.989 --> 07:38.479
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

07:38.758 --> 07:40.783
I know, I know.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.893
It's such a huge,
life-altering thing.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.626
The test is ready.

07:51.003 --> 07:54.495
Okay. Each team will
answer 10 questions.

07:54.774 --> 07:58.608
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.303
The categories are
"Fears and Pet Peeves"...

08:02.582 --> 08:04.243
..."Ancient History"...

08:04.484 --> 08:06.008
..."Literature"...

08:06.285 --> 08:08.583
...and "It's all Relative."

08:10.256 --> 08:11.416
Now...

08:11.691 --> 08:15.183
...the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.800
Okay.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.268
Somebody call it this time.

08:27.773 --> 08:28.933
Tails!

08:29.542 --> 08:30.804
It's heads.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.112
Gentlemen, pick your category.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.315
"Fears and Pet Peeves."

08:38.217 --> 08:41.345
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

08:41.687 --> 08:43.484
-Animals dressed as humans.
-Correct.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.584
-Ladies?
-Same category.

08:50.530 --> 08:55.024
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

08:56.502 --> 08:59.232
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!

09:00.740 --> 09:02.765
That is correct.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.743
The lrish jig guy?

09:06.946 --> 09:11.076
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body!

09:12.652 --> 09:14.051
Gentlemen, your pick.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.618
"It's all Relative."

09:16.556 --> 09:19.116
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.451
You both went to her funeral.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.054
Name that grandmother."

09:26.566 --> 09:29.660
-Nana?
-She has a real name.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.395
Althea!

09:31.604 --> 09:32.935
-What?
-I took a shot!

09:33.139 --> 09:34.128
With Althea?

09:34.373 --> 09:36.841
-Althea is correct.
-Nice shooting!

09:40.513 --> 09:41.741
"Literature."

09:42.415 --> 09:47.045
"Every week the TV Guide comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.347
What name appears
on the address label?"

09:50.556 --> 09:53.525
Chandler gets it!
It's Chandler Bing!

09:54.193 --> 09:58.357
I'm afraid the TV Guide
comes to "Chanandler Bong."

10:01.434 --> 10:02.901
I knew that!

10:03.102 --> 10:05.070
Rachel, use your head!

10:06.606 --> 10:09.234
Actually, it's Ms. Chanandler Bong.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.177
Hello, teeny embryos.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.946
I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!

10:24.624 --> 10:28.560
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.723
We're doing this
for Frank and Alice...

10:31.964 --> 10:34.398
...who you know.
You've been there.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.230
They want you so much.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.135
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

10:43.776 --> 10:47.041
And I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

10:47.246 --> 10:50.443
...until you're ready
to have them take you home.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.250
Next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.756
That's what's supposed to happen.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.889
Ready?

11:06.298 --> 11:07.560
Good luck!

11:09.735 --> 11:13.068
The score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

11:13.272 --> 11:16.935
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick a category.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.804
"It's all Relative"!

11:20.613 --> 11:23.741
-You don't have to shout everything.
-I'm sorry!

11:27.486 --> 11:30.319
"What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

11:30.589 --> 11:33.490
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

11:34.260 --> 11:36.751
Viva Las Gaygas!

11:38.831 --> 11:40.924
Unfortunately, that is correct.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.496
All right. We have a tie.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.698
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.834
The lightning round!

11:56.148 --> 11:59.743
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.850
You guys are dead!

12:02.054 --> 12:04.488
I am so good at lightning rounds!

12:06.325 --> 12:08.885
I majored in lightning rounds,
all right?

12:09.095 --> 12:10.357
We'll destroy you.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.552
Want to bet?

12:12.098 --> 12:15.397
I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.896
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

12:20.106 --> 12:23.007
One hundred and fifty dollars.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.344
Say 200?

12:26.545 --> 12:28.911
Two hundred dollars!

12:29.348 --> 12:30.576
You're doing it again.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.512
Excuse me.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.847
-I don't want to lose $200.
-We won't.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.455
Three hundred?

12:39.191 --> 12:40.556
I'm spicing it up!

12:40.760 --> 12:44.127
So play for some pepper!
Stop spending my money.

12:45.631 --> 12:46.620
I got it!

12:46.932 --> 12:50.390
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.400
That's interesting!

12:52.738 --> 12:55.639
-No way! That rooster's family.
-The duck too!

12:55.875 --> 12:57.866
The duck doesn't make noise!

12:58.077 --> 13:00.341
He gets the other one all riled up!

13:00.880 --> 13:03.508
-We are not
-All right, hold on!

13:05.451 --> 13:06.679
If you win...

13:07.086 --> 13:08.713
...we give up the bird.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.290
But if we win...

13:13.926 --> 13:16.258
...we get your apartment.

13:19.198 --> 13:22.463
-Deal!
-What?

13:23.202 --> 13:27.730
That's crazy. There's no way
we are betting the apartment.

13:31.043 --> 13:35.844
All right, I'm in. Because either
he goes, or I'm buying a coyote.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.590
Betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.397
I have not missed one question
the whole game. I own this game!

13:54.533 --> 13:58.025
-Look at my hand.
-You have the answers written there?

13:59.305 --> 14:02.502
No. Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?

14:03.809 --> 14:05.367
All right, let's do it!

14:06.979 --> 14:09.504
All right.
Gentlemen, you're up first.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.375
You have 30 seconds.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.547
The lightning round begins

14:15.754 --> 14:17.221
Stop it!

14:19.191 --> 14:22.285
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

14:22.494 --> 14:24.291
-Big Fat Goalie.
-Correct!

14:26.999 --> 14:29.399
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie."

14:29.668 --> 14:30.999
Dangerous Liaisons.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.931
-"Her actual favorite is...?"
-Weekend at Bernie's.

14:36.008 --> 14:40.342
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

14:44.316 --> 14:45.578
No!

14:48.020 --> 14:49.078
Her ear!

14:52.358 --> 14:56.454
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

14:56.829 --> 14:57.887
-Everyday use.
-Fancy.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.530
-Guest.
-Fancy guest.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.734
-Two seconds.
-Eleven?

15:02.868 --> 15:05.029
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct!

15:09.174 --> 15:10.163
All right.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.640
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up!

15:18.484 --> 15:20.475
Thirty seconds on the clock.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.280
Five correct questions
wins the game.

15:23.689 --> 15:27.090
The lightning round begins now.
"Joey's favorite food?"

15:27.293 --> 15:28.726
-Sandwiches!
-Correct.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.394
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

15:31.664 --> 15:32.961
-14?
-No, 19.

15:33.165 --> 15:34.291
Thanks, man.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.400
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.069
-His name was...?"
-Maurice!

15:39.305 --> 15:42.331
-"His profession was...?"
-Space cowboy!

15:43.709 --> 15:45.734
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

15:49.982 --> 15:52.212
It has something to do with numbers!

15:52.418 --> 15:54.579
-And processing!
-He carries a briefcase.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.186
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.584
Something to do
with transponding.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.224
He's a transponster!

16:04.430 --> 16:06.261
That's not even a word!

16:07.900 --> 16:10.425
I can get this! I can get this!

16:27.219 --> 16:30.746
-I call Monica's room.
-You can't just call Monica's room.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.991
Sure I can.
Standard shotgun rules.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.660
I'm in sight of the room
and I called it.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.190
Damn!

16:39.765 --> 16:42.495
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.871
Guess the color of my tonsils.
I bet the apartment!

16:47.106 --> 16:49.666
I would never bet this place.
It's too nice.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.438
Are they in there?

16:54.646 --> 16:56.443
Yeah, I'm implanted.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.713
-How do you feel?
-Well, freaked.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.016
It turns out the odds
are really sucky.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.883
And this is
Frank and Alice's only shot.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.628
They are literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

17:12.664 --> 17:13.892
But I bet it works.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.292
Really? How much?

17:18.237 --> 17:20.899
I'm going to take
a pregnancy test now.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.040
Wow! You can tell this soon?

17:23.242 --> 17:25.506
The doctor says it takes a few days.

17:25.811 --> 17:29.838
But my body's always been a little
faster than Western medicine.

17:33.685 --> 17:37.086
I can't believe you guys think
you're moving in here.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.482
Well, believe it, baby!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.654
-Well, I'm not moving.
-What?

17:44.797 --> 17:48.255
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.594
You can't ignore the bet.
It's a bet!

17:50.836 --> 17:53.669
Bet on a bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet.

17:54.940 --> 17:55.998
We have to move.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.574
We would have made them
get rid of the birds.

18:03.615 --> 18:07.676
I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

18:07.953 --> 18:10.148
...this is all your fault.

18:11.323 --> 18:12.312
What?

18:12.491 --> 18:16.257
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that TV Guide every week!

18:16.462 --> 18:18.487
I knew it!

18:19.465 --> 18:21.695
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.129
Cool! Girl roommate.

18:27.806 --> 18:28.795
Well?

18:29.374 --> 18:31.638
Nope, not knocked up yet.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.136
It's only been a couple hours.

18:34.379 --> 18:38.179
Meanwhile, I'll do
whatever I can to help this.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.841
I'm just going to, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

18:44.022 --> 18:46.820
Good. I'm going
to let gravity do its job.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.758
I won't get in the way.

18:49.895 --> 18:54.161
It'll be just like that time I tried to
count all the bumps on your ceiling.

18:55.334 --> 19:00.499
You know, Pheebs, if you sit there long
enough, you'll be sitting in our apartment.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.162
I can't believe this.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.767
Oh, Rach, FYl: Your new apartment
hasn't had hot water since Christmas.

19:10.949 --> 19:13.076
Can you give me a hand?

19:13.318 --> 19:16.810
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!

19:18.023 --> 19:20.821
This is my apartment and I like it!

19:21.026 --> 19:23.187
This is a girl's apartment!

19:23.428 --> 19:27.762
That is a boy's apartment!
It's dirty and it smells!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.867
This is pretty!
It's so pretty!

19:31.136 --> 19:33.366
And look, it's purple!

19:33.605 --> 19:36.972
I tell you, you with your
steady hand, I am not moving.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.269
And now I have got the steady hand.

19:42.548 --> 19:45.142
Okay, okay.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.284
-I'll take care of it.
-That's right.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.386
You do what the hand says!

20:03.669 --> 20:05.796
-How'd it go?
-I lost our mattresses.

20:11.376 --> 20:15.938
Are you in there, little fetus?
In nine months will you come greet us?

20:17.883 --> 20:21.011
I will buy you some Adidas

20:28.093 --> 20:32.325
We were just at the drugstore
so we got you a little present.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.862
That's where all my blood was.

20:36.001 --> 20:39.960
It's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.399
Don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

20:49.047 --> 20:53.143
You feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

20:55.487 --> 20:57.421
All right. I will.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.248
Remember that
it's still really early.

21:00.525 --> 21:05.394
If it says I'm not pregnant, that
doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.395
Just so I don't go completely nuts...

21:08.600 --> 21:11.364
...try not to put
all your hopes on this.

21:15.674 --> 21:16.663
Great.

21:25.250 --> 21:29.016
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

21:29.254 --> 21:32.485
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

21:32.691 --> 21:35.182
That is not true!
She forced me!

21:35.427 --> 21:37.952
You got the question wrong.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.460
It was a stupid, unfair question!

21:40.666 --> 21:42.293
Don't blame the questions!

21:42.501 --> 21:46.835
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.734
-Stop calling it your apartment!
-lt is!

21:52.377 --> 21:56.143
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!

22:02.587 --> 22:05.852
My sister's going to have my baby!

22:14.499 --> 22:17.525
Okay, but this can't
be good for the baby.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.473
I can't find garbage bags.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.877
I think I saw some in here.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.282
What is it?

22:40.959 --> 22:44.895
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

22:46.398 --> 22:49.231
I can't believe we're living here!

22:54.906 --> 22:56.100
What is it?

22:56.341 --> 22:58.866
Did you see the size of the closets?

23:00.011 --> 23:03.105
I can't believe we live here!
