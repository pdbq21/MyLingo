WEBVTT

00:07.054 --> 00:12.851
The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
was such a turn-on. You wanna...?

00:13.901 --> 00:16.019
You know, I'd love to,
but I'm a little tired.

00:16.624 --> 00:19.140
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.

00:20.307 --> 00:21.867
- Hey.
- What's up?

00:22.069 --> 00:25.952
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
by the way, there's no law against.

00:27.114 --> 00:30.109
And then we're gonna grab some food.
So if you want...

00:30.277 --> 00:32.235
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?

00:32.439 --> 00:35.594
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.394
- Sounds like he's with someone.
- He could be alone.

00:38.566 --> 00:41.925
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.

00:42.089 --> 00:44.480
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.

00:44.852 --> 00:47.448
Yeah, I hear someone else
in there with him.

00:52.379 --> 00:54.737
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.

00:54.902 --> 00:57.897
I didn't even have to ask you
to call me that.

00:59.306 --> 01:02.825
- Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

01:02.990 --> 01:07.192
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

01:09.597 --> 01:11.794
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.279
This is none of our business.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.595
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!

01:17.324 --> 01:21.480
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.040
I love Barbados.

01:30.097 --> 01:32.898
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I'm kissing Rachel!

01:34.942 --> 01:36.855
I know. I'm her.

01:38.385 --> 01:40.697
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

01:40.908 --> 01:42.628
- What?
- Get over here!

01:48.235 --> 01:51.116
Oh, my God! I love how thin
these walls are!

02:00.047 --> 02:01.926
Thank you.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.483
The One After Joey and Rachel kiss

02:50.658 --> 02:54.780
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
happen between us. What changed?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.539
Well, I only said that because of Ross.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.466
- And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
- What?

03:00.628 --> 03:02.541
Ross and Charlie?

03:02.710 --> 03:06.753
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?

03:09.236 --> 03:11.035
- Eh, who am I to talk?
- Yeah.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.713
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

03:15.883 --> 03:18.844
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?

03:19.446 --> 03:22.601
- No one is manning that wall!
- I'm on it!

03:25.172 --> 03:27.130
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.

03:27.334 --> 03:30.249
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.

03:30.457 --> 03:33.578
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!

03:33.781 --> 03:37.220
- You realize that's your brother.
- Not until you said it. Somebody switch!

03:39.547 --> 03:41.540
Wow! Wait a minute.

03:41.909 --> 03:44.379
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.

03:44.552 --> 03:48.025
Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones
leaving with the person we came with!

03:48.235 --> 03:51.948
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.032
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.

03:55.202 --> 03:58.083
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.

04:00.888 --> 04:04.122
You gotta hear this, it's great!
It's like free porn.

04:12.219 --> 04:16.011
- Is everything okay?
- It's just... I don't think I can do this.

04:16.183 --> 04:18.460
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?

04:18.626 --> 04:21.860
- I saw that report, with the infrared...
- No! No.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.862
No.

04:24.752 --> 04:28.510
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.

04:28.676 --> 04:32.388
Before anything more happens between
us, I need to know he's okay with it.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.600
- I completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.

04:40.407 --> 04:43.129
I just need a second before I can,
you know...

04:47.414 --> 04:50.933
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

04:57.024 --> 04:59.415
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay!

05:00.828 --> 05:02.821
That's the door. He's gone.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.871
And she's turning on the TV...

05:06.033 --> 05:10.634
...and watching Miss Congeniality.

05:11.238 --> 05:15.121
Honey? If you know it through a wall,
you know it too well.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.967
Hey, what are you guys doing?

05:27.775 --> 05:31.818
We're just... We're sad to go, so we're
just saying goodbye to the hotel.

05:31.979 --> 05:33.619
I love you...

05:34.702 --> 05:39.018
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.

05:40.427 --> 05:43.183
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.

05:47.474 --> 05:49.068
Bye.

05:50.758 --> 05:53.673
Okay. Hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?

05:53.881 --> 05:56.762
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.440
That's the situation as we know it.

06:02.049 --> 06:04.566
If you see him, could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.884
- You got it.
- Thanks.

06:10.097 --> 06:11.372
Thank you.

06:16.664 --> 06:18.178
Other wall, people! Other wall!

06:22.870 --> 06:25.432
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!

06:25.593 --> 06:27.631
- What are we gonna do?
- Okay, just be calm.

06:27.795 --> 06:29.867
For all he knows,
we're just hanging out.

06:30.037 --> 06:32.554
All right? So just be nonchalant.

06:38.285 --> 06:40.848
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.809
Okay, just hide.

06:44.972 --> 06:48.571
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.

06:52.259 --> 06:53.774
There's no room under the bed...

06:55.302 --> 06:59.299
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

07:06.393 --> 07:09.035
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?
- Hi.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.475
I really don't.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.476
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.128
I don't believe this.
Have you guys been...?

07:22.329 --> 07:24.971
This is the listening side of the wall.

07:30.858 --> 07:33.249
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up...

07:33.420 --> 07:35.857
...and part of the reason
was she had feelings for me.

07:36.303 --> 07:37.339
Right. Yeah.

07:37.545 --> 07:40.459
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie
out since the day I met her.

07:40.668 --> 07:44.027
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.

07:44.191 --> 07:47.106
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

07:47.274 --> 07:49.392
...before you know it, we were kissing.

07:49.557 --> 07:51.789
How angry do you think
Joey's gonna be?

07:52.159 --> 07:55.633
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.796
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.

07:59.006 --> 08:00.440
You would think.

08:04.972 --> 08:06.726
Joey?

08:06.894 --> 08:10.253
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?

08:12.780 --> 08:14.339
What? Hey!

08:14.502 --> 08:17.736
What are you...? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?

08:17.945 --> 08:19.699
Yeah!

08:20.347 --> 08:21.828
Now, what is this?

08:22.269 --> 08:25.070
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...

08:25.232 --> 08:29.468
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.

08:29.637 --> 08:32.950
No, no. Have you thought
about how complicated this could get?

08:33.120 --> 08:35.272
- What about Ross?
- Well, he's with Charlie now.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.876
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.

08:39.046 --> 08:42.725
And as his friend, I mean, don't you
think he deserves the same from you?

08:46.493 --> 08:48.486
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

08:51.018 --> 08:53.011
Look, we appreciate all the advice...

08:53.180 --> 08:55.538
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.937
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.939
- Sure.
- Enunciate.

09:01.228 --> 09:03.300
Get out!

09:09.156 --> 09:10.989
Are they right?

09:12.079 --> 09:15.837
Probably, yeah. I mean,
maybe we should...

09:16.003 --> 09:17.802
...hold off until we talk to Ross.

09:18.846 --> 09:22.638
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.

09:22.850 --> 09:24.364
Yeah, I think that would be best.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.130
So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.493
- Although...
- I like "although."

09:32.419 --> 09:34.218
I mean, you know...

09:34.381 --> 09:37.616
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...

09:37.785 --> 09:39.505
...six years.

09:39.707 --> 09:41.460
Six years?

09:41.909 --> 09:45.143
Wow. That's almost as long
as high school.

09:49.597 --> 09:52.672
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.314
Absolutely.

09:54.481 --> 09:56.952
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

09:58.005 --> 10:00.157
I'm thinking about you.

10:00.928 --> 10:02.328
Yeah.

10:04.091 --> 10:08.213
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.

10:10.097 --> 10:11.851
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10:12.139 --> 10:14.097
Seriously, what is it?

10:15.623 --> 10:18.823
Nothing. It's really... It's nothing.
Come here. Come here.

10:20.628 --> 10:21.823
What's wrong?

10:22.910 --> 10:25.301
Sorry, I just...

10:25.472 --> 10:28.353
I can't seem to get Ross
out of my head.

10:30.558 --> 10:32.630
Well, maybe I can help.

10:38.245 --> 10:41.285
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.889
Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.

10:52.139 --> 10:53.813
Hey. You guys ready to go?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.743
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.

10:56.944 --> 11:00.144
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.743
You're not supposed to take that.

11:02.910 --> 11:05.711
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?

11:05.873 --> 11:07.706
Learn about Jesus.

11:10.518 --> 11:12.636
- Hey!
- So did you talk to Joey?

11:12.800 --> 11:17.002
No. I couldn't find him. I'm just
gonna talk to him on the plane.

11:17.204 --> 11:20.803
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.323
Stop it.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.931
Ph.D.

11:27.134 --> 11:29.252
You're filthy.

11:29.977 --> 11:33.450
- Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?
- Actually, I think she went to the salon.

11:33.661 --> 11:35.858
Oh, yeah. Oh, she went
to the salon, all right.

11:36.023 --> 11:38.459
Check it out!

11:40.027 --> 11:42.020
Whose day just got better?

11:42.710 --> 11:44.668
Chandler!

11:46.113 --> 11:47.149
Hey!

11:49.717 --> 11:51.710
- What do you think?
- I think...

11:51.879 --> 11:54.475
I think I can see your scalp.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.842
Don't you just love it?

11:57.004 --> 11:59.805
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.

12:01.008 --> 12:04.287
It's something. You go, girlfriend.

12:05.853 --> 12:07.891
- You never said that in your life.
- Not once.

12:08.055 --> 12:11.334
- I thought so.
- Oh, and listen to this.

12:15.142 --> 12:19.139
What do you know? It's a treat
for the eyes and the ears.

12:31.999 --> 12:36.474
Wow, it's kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

12:36.684 --> 12:40.316
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.520
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?

12:43.691 --> 12:47.529
Oh, I mean, l... Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.

12:47.695 --> 12:49.129
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.

12:50.578 --> 12:54.176
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
to sit with Allen Iverson over there.

12:59.867 --> 13:03.067
Once we're in the air and the
captain turns off the seat belt sign...

13:03.230 --> 13:06.191
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.

13:07.474 --> 13:11.518
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.

13:11.679 --> 13:14.913
- Because items may shift during...
- Oh, you're not good at this.

13:18.485 --> 13:21.561
- Do you have to go home tonight?
- No, I think I could come over.

13:21.729 --> 13:23.049
It's Saturday, right?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.446
What?

13:25.613 --> 13:29.165
- I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?

13:29.537 --> 13:31.335
I have a date.

13:32.940 --> 13:38.065
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.

13:39.346 --> 13:41.863
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

13:42.069 --> 13:44.791
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.428
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.

13:47.635 --> 13:49.194
Three months?

13:50.157 --> 13:51.672
Okay.

13:51.839 --> 13:56.520
This is none of my business, but how
long are you gonna keep seeing her?

13:57.004 --> 13:59.760
I'll tell her that it's over
tonight at dinner. I promise.

13:59.967 --> 14:02.403
Oh, okay, good. You do that.

14:03.050 --> 14:07.606
When you get home, maybe there'll be a
special delivery package waiting for you.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.570
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.

14:13.420 --> 14:17.383
- Pull out the packing material...
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.

14:23.831 --> 14:27.144
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.

14:27.354 --> 14:30.429
He's in a good mood after
the flight attendant says "duty-free."

14:31.118 --> 14:32.917
Okay. Good luck.

14:36.524 --> 14:39.724
Ross is coming over. I think now
would be a good time to talk to him.

14:40.568 --> 14:42.959
I guess so. I'm just...
I'm really nervous.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.522
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...

14:45.693 --> 14:48.334
...they'll probably be serving dinner.

14:50.297 --> 14:52.051
Still nervous?

14:52.620 --> 14:55.136
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.383
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

14:57.545 --> 15:00.904
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.947
Good luck.

15:07.154 --> 15:09.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:09.957 --> 15:11.631
So I...

15:11.799 --> 15:14.235
I kind of need to talk to you
about Charlie.

15:14.401 --> 15:18.239
- Yeah?
- Last night, after you guys broke up...

15:18.405 --> 15:21.640
So sorry to hear about that,
by the way.

15:22.570 --> 15:27.204
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...

15:28.095 --> 15:29.849
Well...

15:30.377 --> 15:31.653
You kissed.

15:31.819 --> 15:36.101
Wh... What?

15:36.263 --> 15:39.144
What? What would give you that idea?

15:39.346 --> 15:41.909
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.

15:43.190 --> 15:47.073
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?

15:47.274 --> 15:50.235
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
- What?

15:50.397 --> 15:52.834
It's okay. You know, look...

15:53.000 --> 15:55.995
...I totally understand, all right?
You guys...

15:56.163 --> 16:00.764
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And...

16:00.928 --> 16:04.003
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?

16:04.171 --> 16:05.652
Yeah.

16:08.175 --> 16:11.329
- Now I have something...
- I am speechless.

16:12.620 --> 16:17.140
I mean, the fact that you would put
my happiness first like that, I mean...

16:17.304 --> 16:19.662
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?

16:19.867 --> 16:22.429
- Well, look, before you go...
- No, I mean it.

16:22.630 --> 16:29.030
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.

16:29.837 --> 16:31.557
I am those things, yeah.

16:32.239 --> 16:38.241
I've known Chandler longer, so I think
of him as my best friend. But now...

16:39.567 --> 16:41.799
...I may have to rethink some stuff.

16:42.329 --> 16:43.445
Dude!

16:43.651 --> 16:47.773
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you...

16:50.017 --> 16:51.657
I can't think of anything.

16:54.261 --> 16:56.254
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:00.307 --> 17:01.583
- So hi.
- Hi.

17:01.749 --> 17:05.905
- So you talked to Joey?
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.

17:06.073 --> 17:07.906
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

17:08.075 --> 17:10.876
- So everything's okay?
- Oh, no, it's great.

17:11.038 --> 17:16.322
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
- Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.

17:16.804 --> 17:19.479
Well, I'm so excited about this.

17:20.808 --> 17:23.644
Really? Excited?

17:23.811 --> 17:29.129
What, are you kidding? I have had
some very dirty dreams about this.

17:32.179 --> 17:34.297
Excuse me.

17:39.947 --> 17:42.179
You didn't tell him, did you?

17:42.349 --> 17:45.469
I couldn't. He was saying all
these really nice things about me.

17:45.633 --> 17:49.789
I didn't want him to get mad and take
them back. I'm gonna edge out Chandler!

17:50.518 --> 17:53.638
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
to New York, I will tell him.

17:53.801 --> 17:55.521
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

18:13.981 --> 18:16.417
- Hi, Mike's place.
- Hey, it's Mike.

18:16.624 --> 18:19.186
- That was fast.
- Oh, no, she's not here yet.

18:19.987 --> 18:23.586
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.

18:23.791 --> 18:27.184
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
strap on a pair.

18:29.116 --> 18:33.717
Why don't you tell her that we got back
together. Women appreciate honesty.

18:33.881 --> 18:38.914
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYI.

18:40.047 --> 18:44.488
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.

18:44.692 --> 18:46.924
Her name's Precious?

18:47.094 --> 18:50.214
Is she a pure breed,
or did you pick her up at the pound?

18:51.458 --> 18:55.216
- I just want to give you a heads up.
- Okay. And if she gets upset...

18:55.382 --> 18:58.377
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.988
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

19:10.237 --> 19:12.515
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

19:12.680 --> 19:16.563
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?

19:22.089 --> 19:26.132
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!

19:27.895 --> 19:30.047
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

19:30.257 --> 19:32.136
So if you want people to see them...

19:32.299 --> 19:35.180
...you're not having them taken out,
say, at the break of dawn?

19:35.823 --> 19:39.262
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.

19:45.713 --> 19:47.865
You like that, right?

19:54.682 --> 19:57.757
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from 10.

19:57.965 --> 20:00.721
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
from Apocalypse Now.

20:01.769 --> 20:05.527
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

20:05.693 --> 20:09.132
Now that we're home, you don't have
that problem. If you think about it...

20:09.296 --> 20:11.095
I hate them.

20:11.859 --> 20:15.776
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did I? Let's refresh.

20:15.943 --> 20:18.983
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.

20:19.987 --> 20:22.982
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.

20:23.470 --> 20:26.306
Again, let's journey back.

20:26.634 --> 20:31.075
As I recall, Rachel said she had never
noticed the shape of your skull before.

20:31.238 --> 20:35.600
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.

20:36.564 --> 20:39.843
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.

20:40.047 --> 20:43.247
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.

20:46.253 --> 20:48.611
- Get yourself in the tooth?
- And the eye.

20:57.545 --> 21:03.227
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.345
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

21:06.514 --> 21:09.235
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Greene? Huh?

21:09.396 --> 21:13.234
Did she give you a bottle of
antidepressants again to use as a rattle?

21:14.562 --> 21:18.001
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.

21:19.807 --> 21:24.248
Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for
you, okay? I want you to wait right here.

21:24.411 --> 21:26.085
Come here, sweetie.

21:27.174 --> 21:31.296
Ross, actually, there's something
that I really need to talk to you about.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.092
Okay, shoot.

21:33.260 --> 21:38.659
- Okay. All right, here's the deal.
- Oh, no!

21:39.747 --> 21:44.587
- What is it?
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!

21:45.753 --> 21:50.035
- Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!

21:52.720 --> 21:54.758
Why? Why me?

21:55.322 --> 21:58.557
Because you took 300 bottles
of shampoo?

22:00.047 --> 22:02.199
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?

22:02.530 --> 22:07.529
- Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and...
- Oh, not another one!

22:08.976 --> 22:13.532
Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!

22:15.182 --> 22:18.576
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?

22:20.508 --> 22:24.824
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
- You think?

22:28.676 --> 22:30.429
Okay. Bye.

22:30.598 --> 22:33.718
All right, so Mike's on his way over.

22:33.881 --> 22:37.764
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so...

22:37.925 --> 22:42.047
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.

22:42.850 --> 22:46.927
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...

22:47.094 --> 22:49.451
...are you guys getting back together
or something?

22:50.778 --> 22:52.417
All right.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.058
Susie... Can I call you Susie?

22:57.585 --> 22:59.497
My name is Precious.

23:00.267 --> 23:02.385
I can't say that.

23:03.671 --> 23:06.552
Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

23:06.954 --> 23:10.792
Mike and I are back together.
And unfortunately...

23:10.958 --> 23:14.511
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.

23:14.682 --> 23:21.082
He's very sorry about that, and wishes
you the best luck in all your endeavors.

23:22.249 --> 23:25.563
I just can't believe this. Why?

23:25.813 --> 23:27.726
- Well, I don't...
- Why would he do this?

23:27.895 --> 23:30.537
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

23:30.738 --> 23:32.696
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

23:32.900 --> 23:35.975
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

23:36.143 --> 23:39.104
Have some pride, for the love of God!

23:43.350 --> 23:46.311
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

23:46.514 --> 23:50.192
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.

23:50.357 --> 23:55.197
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.

23:55.523 --> 24:00.522
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!

24:04.251 --> 24:07.326
Look, Precious...

24:09.416 --> 24:13.129
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...

24:13.300 --> 24:15.692
...and let's face it,
Mike's kind of a wang.

24:16.864 --> 24:19.745
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.

24:19.947 --> 24:22.544
He was gonna break up with you
on your birthday?

24:22.710 --> 24:27.310
I don't like to kiss and tell, but
he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

24:27.515 --> 24:30.635
Oh, my God, you know, maybe
you're right. Maybe I don't need him.

24:30.798 --> 24:33.679
I deserve to be treated with respect.

24:34.281 --> 24:39.725
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!

24:44.772 --> 24:46.765
You're welcome.

24:51.699 --> 24:55.582
Honey? You've been in there
for a long time. Is everything okay?

24:55.743 --> 24:57.576
Not really.

24:59.787 --> 25:01.700
I have a problem.

25:02.309 --> 25:05.270
Really? What happened?

25:05.472 --> 25:10.757
Well, I was dancing around
and singing "No Woman, No Cry"...

25:12.600 --> 25:14.718
...and I got stuck.

25:15.282 --> 25:18.562
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move.

25:24.411 --> 25:27.247
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?

25:27.454 --> 25:29.333
I guess so.

25:30.818 --> 25:35.373
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

25:39.106 --> 25:40.587
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:40.788 --> 25:44.147
- So? Did you tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...

25:44.311 --> 25:47.351
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.

25:48.035 --> 25:50.471
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
- No, no, no, no.

25:50.638 --> 25:53.997
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.

25:54.161 --> 25:57.122
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
all you have to do is go:

25:57.284 --> 25:59.436
"I didn't mean it.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.763
I'm so sorry."

26:06.253 --> 26:08.132
Yeah, because that's what we do.

26:08.495 --> 26:13.335
All right, all right, okay. How about this?
How about this? Tomorrow...

26:13.781 --> 26:17.140
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.

26:17.304 --> 26:18.944
Okay, that sounds fair.

26:19.146 --> 26:21.788
- That just means, once again, we can't...
- I know.

26:21.949 --> 26:25.662
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.

26:25.873 --> 26:29.711
- No! Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.

26:30.317 --> 26:32.595
All right, so I guess
that means good night then.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.435
Yep. Good night.

26:41.849 --> 26:43.762
Good night.

26:45.092 --> 26:46.652
Good night.

26:53.020 --> 26:55.696
- Seriously, good night.
- Stop saying good night.

27:14.802 --> 27:18.400
I'm so sorry.

27:24.451 --> 27:26.489
Look what I found in the drawer.

27:28.616 --> 27:31.416
And you said I'd never wear this.

27:32.299 --> 27:35.739
Now that I untangled you, how about
you do a little something for me?

27:35.943 --> 27:39.576
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.

27:39.747 --> 27:44.701
- Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it.
- This is what I want to do.

27:45.673 --> 27:47.153
Okay.

27:47.394 --> 27:50.549
I just don't get why you like it so much.

27:50.718 --> 27:54.077
She's an FBI agent posing
as a beauty contestant!

27:56.564 --> 27:57.554
