00:03.072 --> 00:06.842
lt's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?

00:07.014 --> 00:11.182
-l thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
-l thought l'd end up kissing Charlie too.

00:11.355 --> 00:13.188
But surprise!

00:14.428 --> 00:16.899
l missed most of the party.

00:17.067 --> 00:18.467
Charlie's a girl, right?

00:19.606 --> 00:24.047
Yeah, she's this new professor
in my department that l did not kiss.

00:24.582 --> 00:28.955
l don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!

00:30.293 --> 00:34.427
-Why do you care so much?
-Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

00:37.575 --> 00:42.414
Because Ross is the father of my child.

00:42.585 --> 00:46.787
You know, and l want him
to hook up with lots of women.

00:47.227 --> 00:52.101
All l'm saying is, l don't think that Joey
and Charlie have anything in common.

00:52.270 --> 00:56.438
l don't know. They seemed to have
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.321
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?

01:01.489 --> 01:03.960
And if the kids got her intelligence...

01:04.128 --> 01:07.123
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

01:07.300 --> 01:09.703
...those nerds would get laid!

01:11.576 --> 01:15.015
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? l mean....

01:15.183 --> 01:18.280
lt's no big deal.
l just met her. l'm fine with it.

01:21.362 --> 01:23.993
God, l forgot how hot she was.

01:24.702 --> 01:26.968
l'm gonna get some more coffee.

01:27.140 --> 01:30.078
-Oh, you know, l'll come with you.
-Okay.

01:31.148 --> 01:35.556
-So a professor, huh?
-Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

01:35.724 --> 01:38.594
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

01:44.107 --> 01:46.840
Guess that's not how she used it.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.243
l feel like l owe you an explanation.

01:51.422 --> 01:55.419
l don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.066
l'm....

01:57.602 --> 02:01.633
Well, l'm kind of embarrassed.
l really hope you don't think less of me.

02:01.843 --> 02:04.370
Think less of you? No.
l don't think less of you.

02:04.549 --> 02:07.384
l mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.

02:07.555 --> 02:10.925
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...

02:11.095 --> 02:14.933
...those people are stupid.
l hate those people.

02:15.370 --> 02:17.431
Actually, l'm a little surprised at myself.

02:17.608 --> 02:20.808
l mean, Joey's so different
from the guys l usually date.

02:20.981 --> 02:24.147
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.

02:24.321 --> 02:27.293
-You know, very cerebral--
-Yeah, l know the type.

02:27.695 --> 02:32.136
lf we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.

02:34.441 --> 02:37.413
No? Am l getting close?

03:29.151 --> 03:30.176
-Hey!
-Hi.

03:30.386 --> 03:32.823
Hey, you guys.
Look what l just got.

03:34.161 --> 03:37.361
Oh, wow! l love those!
Where did you get them?

03:37.535 --> 03:42.476
l bought them off eBay. They used
to belong to the late Shania Twain.

03:45.483 --> 03:47.920
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

03:48.857 --> 03:50.690
Oh, then l overpaid.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.662
Hey, what's this?

03:54.836 --> 03:57.967
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.

03:58.142 --> 04:01.912
You can't show Phoebe this.
She hates those corporate massage chains.

04:02.484 --> 04:04.682
What, now l can't get a massage?

04:04.856 --> 04:08.226
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.

04:08.395 --> 04:11.527
l can't eat veal. l can't wear fur.

04:11.703 --> 04:14.105
l can't go hunting.

04:15.109 --> 04:18.571
-Do you want to go hunting?
-l would like to have the option.

04:20.687 --> 04:23.385
What's that? Hey, Rachel?

04:23.560 --> 04:25.290
No, you can't go there!

04:25.463 --> 04:28.060
You know how l feel about
these big massage places.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.706
They're putting people like me
out of business.

04:30.874 --> 04:33.174
She wants to go hunting too!

04:36.819 --> 04:38.914
Phoebe, come on,
l don't want to waste it.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.322
lt would be like throwing
away 1 00 bucks.

04:41.495 --> 04:44.490
Okay, this is not about the money. Okay?

04:44.669 --> 04:47.869
lt's about corporate greed
destroying our hearts...

04:48.042 --> 04:51.208
...and leaving us hollow shells.

04:52.551 --> 04:55.181
l don't care about any of that.

04:57.260 --> 05:01.895
Well, do you care about friendship?
l feel really strongly about this.

05:02.103 --> 05:05.804
Please don't use this gift certificate.
l'm asking you as a friend.

05:06.044 --> 05:10.075
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

05:11.021 --> 05:12.250
Fine. l won't use it.

05:12.423 --> 05:14.359
-Promise?
-l promise.

05:14.562 --> 05:18.126
-Thank you.
-Well, l am going hunting.

05:24.014 --> 05:26.416
Hey, honey. l missed you today.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.112
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Hey.

05:29.859 --> 05:34.699
-What do you wanna do tonight?
-Oh, well, maybe we could....

05:44.320 --> 05:47.816
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?

05:48.028 --> 05:49.588
Know your audience.

05:51.234 --> 05:54.537
Besides, tomorrow we're doing
those fertility tests.

05:54.709 --> 05:57.704
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.279
Do we really need to take those tests?

06:01.455 --> 06:03.448
l don't like the words they use,
you know?

06:03.626 --> 06:08.226
They're so clinical.
This is a pee-pee, that's a hoo-hoo.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.465
We've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

06:11.642 --> 06:14.546
l think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.

06:14.715 --> 06:18.780
-Just a few routine tests.
-But l don't want to do it in a cup.

06:19.357 --> 06:23.457
-What is the big deal?
-lt's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.967
lt's not okay to do it
in a doctor's office...

06:26.138 --> 06:29.543
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?

06:32.416 --> 06:36.049
l cannot believe Ross told you that.

06:36.626 --> 06:40.589
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.497
Look, l don't want to do
these tests either.

06:43.673 --> 06:46.007
But l really do think
it's a good idea.

06:46.178 --> 06:48.547
l'm sure a doctor's office
can't be worse...

06:48.716 --> 06:51.984
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.984
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

07:02.143 --> 07:05.445
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?

07:11.394 --> 07:12.419
-Hey!
-Hi.

07:12.664 --> 07:14.793
-Come on in. How are you?
-l'm good.

07:14.969 --> 07:17.736
-Can l offer you a drink?
-Please.

07:17.908 --> 07:20.105
l have been crazed all day.

07:20.279 --> 07:23.479
l had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...

07:23.686 --> 07:25.781
...and l'm writing the foreword
for a book.

07:25.957 --> 07:30.558
l had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today l had to open a door and go:

07:32.971 --> 07:34.941
So l am just so excited to be here.

07:35.109 --> 07:38.343
-l can't wait to explore the city.
-lf you need a tour guide....

07:38.516 --> 07:40.952
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.

07:41.121 --> 07:45.152
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?

07:45.329 --> 07:49.497
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.

07:53.111 --> 07:54.340
Okay.

07:54.515 --> 07:58.512
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.

07:58.790 --> 08:00.657
l know.

08:02.063 --> 08:06.333
-But first, l have to see the Met.
-Okay, let me stop you right there.

08:06.505 --> 08:09.476
The Mets suck, okay?

08:11.381 --> 08:13.784
You wanna see the Yankees.

08:13.953 --> 08:16.652
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.

08:16.826 --> 08:19.262
Which one? They all suck.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.559
The museum.

08:23.338 --> 08:25.365
l don't think so.

08:31.221 --> 08:34.524
-Hi there.
-Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

08:34.695 --> 08:36.562
How may l help you?

08:37.400 --> 08:41.204
Hi. l have a massage appointment
under Rachel Greene.

08:41.374 --> 08:46.180
-Okay.
-And here is my gift certificate.

08:47.721 --> 08:52.595
-This has been torn up.
-And taped back together.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.361
Okay. Well, l'll call you as soon
as your massage therapist is ready.

08:57.541 --> 09:00.103
-Okay.
-Have a seat through the glass doors.

09:00.547 --> 09:04.544
-Through the glass doors.
-Through the glass doors.

09:05.723 --> 09:07.123
All righty then.

09:14.908 --> 09:17.675
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.

09:17.881 --> 09:21.285
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?

09:24.427 --> 09:26.090
Oh, no. No, no.

09:26.699 --> 09:30.297
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?

09:30.507 --> 09:33.843
-Sorry. Everyone is booked.
-That woman can't know l work here.

09:34.013 --> 09:36.541
She's a friend of mine
and l made this big stink...

09:36.719 --> 09:38.848
...about how awful
these massage chains are.

09:39.023 --> 09:42.656
-Then why do you work here?
-Because it's good money.

09:43.131 --> 09:44.828
But that doesn't change the fact...

09:45.002 --> 09:48.202
...that this is an evil,
bloodsucking corporate machine.

09:48.809 --> 09:51.975
Well, l think this is a great place
to work.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.485
Okay, are they listening?

10:00.265 --> 10:01.894
-Ross. Hey.
-Hi.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.200
l need to talk to you about Charlie.

10:05.409 --> 10:07.880
Oh, do you? Do you really?

10:08.448 --> 10:10.919
Yeah, l'm kind of having
a little problem.

10:11.254 --> 10:16.094
Look, if you don't know what the word
''acrimonious'' means, just don't use it.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.629
Look, you know Charlie, right?

10:18.803 --> 10:22.766
-She's cool, funny, her body is so--
-Get to the problem.

10:22.944 --> 10:27.385
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls l've ever dated.

10:27.587 --> 10:29.488
Combined.

10:29.658 --> 10:34.532
You know? And l just--
l don't want her to think l'm stupid.

10:37.507 --> 10:39.977
Are you wearing two belts?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.849
Hey, what do you know?

10:48.395 --> 10:51.527
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.

10:51.702 --> 10:55.266
Well, she wants to go
to all these cultural places...

10:55.442 --> 10:59.713
...and l don't know how to talk about
that stuff. You gotta help me out.

10:59.885 --> 11:02.857
l don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.

11:03.024 --> 11:06.121
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person l know.

11:06.297 --> 11:10.431
And l really like this girl, okay?
l don't want to lose her.

11:13.946 --> 11:15.141
-Fine.
-Thanks.

11:15.315 --> 11:17.148
Okay. Let's see.

11:17.319 --> 11:21.191
-Oh, you should take her to the Met.
-The Mets.

11:22.329 --> 11:26.326
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

11:27.974 --> 11:30.308
Oh, that's what she meant.

11:30.479 --> 11:33.975
lf they're gonna shorten it, they
should call it the ''Muse,'' you know?

11:34.153 --> 11:36.920
Short for ''museum''
and avoid all the confusion.

11:38.261 --> 11:44.137
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.

11:44.306 --> 11:47.176
Okay. All right,
so l'll take her to the Met.

11:47.346 --> 11:53.313
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

11:53.826 --> 11:55.955
You know what?
She loves architecture.

11:56.130 --> 11:59.695
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

11:59.871 --> 12:03.572
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.

12:03.779 --> 12:06.375
Jeez. Sounds like you
should be going on this date.

12:06.985 --> 12:08.716
But l'm not.

12:09.991 --> 12:12.484
-And you know what--?
-Okay, slow down.

12:12.664 --> 12:15.898
You're going way too fast.
Okay? Just go back to the Met.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.769
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.

12:18.943 --> 12:21.436
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?

12:21.615 --> 12:23.208
That's the antiquities wing.

12:23.384 --> 12:26.687
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.

12:29.631 --> 12:33.468
Okay. So l walk in the door
and make a right.

12:46.464 --> 12:49.459
l have a weird feeling about
this place. How do l know...

12:49.638 --> 12:53.669
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the lnternet?

12:55.115 --> 12:59.283
Because, honey, and l mean this
in the sweetest way possible...

12:59.456 --> 13:01.927
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

13:03.464 --> 13:05.195
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

13:05.402 --> 13:08.374
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.010
Deposit my specimen?

13:10.178 --> 13:13.709
l usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.

13:17.961 --> 13:19.863
Thanks. Got it.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.967
All right. Honey, my tests
are down the hall.

13:23.137 --> 13:26.337
-Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
-Yeah, l guess.

13:26.511 --> 13:29.380
Look, l know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.

13:29.551 --> 13:32.351
No one here even knows you.

13:33.759 --> 13:37.756
Oh, my God!

13:41.040 --> 13:42.269
Oh, come on!

13:49.924 --> 13:52.156
How great is this?

13:52.362 --> 13:55.300
We're probably fertile. Let's go home.

13:58.074 --> 13:59.566
Why are you here?

13:59.744 --> 14:03.046
Sid and l are trying again
and we had trouble last time--

14:03.217 --> 14:07.055
No, no, no. l mean, why?
Why is she here?

14:07.426 --> 14:11.925
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.699
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.446
What?

14:22.255 --> 14:26.754
This was fun. But l've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.833
l'd love to stay
but l've got a hot date.

14:32.008 --> 14:36.108
Please go. Just let me know
if you need a hand.

14:41.393 --> 14:44.126
l think it just fell off.

14:49.644 --> 14:51.773
Hello, <i>ja</i>.

14:53.417 --> 14:56.150
lt's time for your massage, <i>ja</i>?

14:56.323 --> 14:58.384
Put your face in the hole.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.269
A Swedish massage
from a real Swedish person.

15:04.439 --> 15:07.206
Okay, then l'm Swedish.

15:09.349 --> 15:11.718
So, what's your name?

15:11.888 --> 15:14.689
lt's a normal Swedish name.

15:14.861 --> 15:16.524
lkea.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.363
-Wow. What an interesting name.
-Yeah.

15:21.541 --> 15:24.741
-You know, l--
-Time for your scalp massage.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.713
Wow. l really love your--

15:31.862 --> 15:35.666
-ls something wrong?
-No, it's just....

15:35.870 --> 15:37.931
lt just feels so good...

15:38.107 --> 15:39.906
...lkea.

15:40.946 --> 15:45.114
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?

15:46.591 --> 15:48.025
Stockholm.

15:48.461 --> 15:51.092
Damn. l wish l knew
if that was right.

15:53.137 --> 15:57.100
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.

15:57.479 --> 16:00.007
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...

16:00.184 --> 16:04.352
...as his elusive subject was light itself.

16:06.297 --> 16:09.828
Now, do you have any idea
what you just said?

16:12.810 --> 16:16.944
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking ''monster trucks.''

16:19.356 --> 16:21.485
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...

16:21.661 --> 16:25.658
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
l just--

16:25.836 --> 16:30.368
-l wrote that out phonetically for you.
-Phonetically?

16:31.246 --> 16:34.686
Yeah, that means--
We just don't have time for this.

16:34.854 --> 16:39.558
l gotta say, l'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.

16:40.031 --> 16:42.297
l'm an actor.
l can memorize anything.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.095
Last week on <i>Days</i>, l had to say:

16:44.272 --> 16:46.607
''Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.''

16:46.778 --> 16:50.741
-Wow. What does that mean?
-No idea.

16:50.919 --> 16:54.289
But the guy l said it to
dies in the next scene...

16:54.459 --> 16:57.397
...so l guess it means,
''You'll get eaten by a bear.''

17:01.306 --> 17:02.832
Okay.

17:03.645 --> 17:06.640
-So let's move on to the Renaissance.
-Okay.

17:07.653 --> 17:10.146
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

17:10.324 --> 17:13.421
...to highlight the anguish
of the central figure.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.328
Touch it. lt's really bumpy.

17:16.805 --> 17:21.371
No, no, no. No ad-libbing.
And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.

17:21.581 --> 17:22.810
-Come on.
-No. No!

17:33.972 --> 17:35.999
My specimen's in the room.

17:36.176 --> 17:40.412
l just want to thank whoever knocked
on the door while l was in there.

17:40.619 --> 17:42.714
Really helped speed the process along.

17:45.762 --> 17:48.426
Janice, you're not gone?

17:49.670 --> 17:50.933
Sid is still in his room.

17:51.140 --> 17:55.514
l don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.

17:56.918 --> 17:59.719
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?

17:59.891 --> 18:04.195
-Yeah. The hard part's over.
-That's not the hard part, honey.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.904
No, there's talking to you,
but Monica's coming out.

18:08.073 --> 18:09.565
And we're gonna go soon.

18:10.244 --> 18:11.405
Chandler.

18:11.581 --> 18:15.145
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?

18:15.321 --> 18:20.059
l mean, oh, when Sid and l did this
last time, my God, l was a mess.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.238
l haven't even thought
about the results.

18:24.406 --> 18:26.741
l just assumed everything
would be okay.

18:26.911 --> 18:29.211
Well, you know what? lt probably is.

18:29.382 --> 18:30.851
But what if it's not okay?

18:31.019 --> 18:34.219
l mean, what if there's a reason
we can't have a baby?

18:34.392 --> 18:37.729
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.961
l'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

18:41.574 --> 18:46.881
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. l can't
believe l didn't even think of that.

18:47.051 --> 18:51.652
l guess l was so worried about
having to come here and do that.

18:51.828 --> 18:54.162
You can do it
in a Taco Bell parking lot...

18:54.332 --> 18:56.826
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?

18:59.175 --> 19:01.441
lt was a Wendy's!

19:11.133 --> 19:15.939
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.479
Wow, lkea.

19:20.151 --> 19:22.554
What a rich culture.

19:22.723 --> 19:25.489
You know what?
l have a friend who's a masseuse.

19:25.662 --> 19:29.396
-Oh? <i>Ja, ja</i>?
-<i>Ja</i>. She's not very good, though.

19:34.847 --> 19:38.377
-And why do you think that is?
-l don't know.

19:38.555 --> 19:41.755
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...

19:41.961 --> 19:44.592
...from playing crummy guitar.

19:52.415 --> 19:56.219
Or maybe she has trouble
loosening your knots...

19:56.390 --> 19:59.852
...because you're such
a high-maintenance tight-ass.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.795
-Phoebe!
-You know it's me?

20:02.001 --> 20:04.233
Well, for like a half an hour!

20:04.406 --> 20:07.242
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

20:08.815 --> 20:10.443
How can you come here?

20:10.619 --> 20:14.149
-Why didn't you tell me you work here?
-l don't have to tell you everything!

20:14.325 --> 20:17.821
You do if you're gonna make me feel
guilty for getting a free massage.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.262
Tip's not included.

20:21.774 --> 20:24.108
Why did you lie to me
about working here?

20:24.279 --> 20:28.584
Because l was ashamed, okay?
l sold out for the cash.

20:28.755 --> 20:33.993
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.

20:39.309 --> 20:44.183
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now l'm this corporate stooge...

20:44.352 --> 20:46.653
...and punching a clock...

20:46.824 --> 20:48.691
...and paying taxes!

20:49.597 --> 20:52.501
Phoebe, honey,
if you hate it so much...

20:52.669 --> 20:56.403
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.

20:56.711 --> 20:59.204
Be true to what you believe in.

20:59.382 --> 21:03.015
Honey, you have principles,
and l so admire that.

21:03.190 --> 21:05.387
l don't have any.

21:07.164 --> 21:10.159
You know what? You're right.
l am gonna quit.

21:10.337 --> 21:14.072
-lt's time l took my life back.
-Good for you, Pheebs.

21:17.351 --> 21:22.191
lf you guys have microphones in
there too, l didn't mean any of that.

21:22.863 --> 21:24.730
l love you.

21:27.438 --> 21:31.880
Got you! Die! Die! Die!

21:32.983 --> 21:37.287
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.

21:38.393 --> 21:39.726
-Hey.
-Hi.

21:39.897 --> 21:41.799
Hey, how was the Met?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.063
The museum was amazing.

21:44.238 --> 21:46.607
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

21:46.777 --> 21:48.940
Not so much, no.

21:49.115 --> 21:51.814
He had clearly memorized
all this stuff to say...

21:51.988 --> 21:54.755
...and some of it didn't
even make any sense.

21:55.528 --> 21:57.292
-What do you mean?
-Well, for one...

21:57.465 --> 22:00.437
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.

22:03.243 --> 22:07.776
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
into the Met, did you go to the right?

22:07.953 --> 22:11.893
-No. No, we went to the left.
-Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

22:14.265 --> 22:17.830
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.

22:18.574 --> 22:21.340
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

22:23.584 --> 22:24.643
What?

22:26.423 --> 22:28.325
Actually, Joey's your friend...

22:28.493 --> 22:31.090
...and you don't know me that well.
lt'd be weird.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.166
Well, l mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.

22:34.338 --> 22:35.363
Well....

22:36.510 --> 22:40.108
l'm thinking that maybe Joey
isn't the right guy for me right now.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.518
You know, maybe l should
be with someone...

22:45.562 --> 22:49.331
...l have more in common with.
You know what l mean?

22:50.638 --> 22:52.231
Yeah.

22:54.747 --> 22:57.240
Yeah, but you know what?

22:58.386 --> 23:01.415
l think you should give Joey a chance.

23:01.594 --> 23:03.426
l mean, he's a great guy.

23:03.598 --> 23:06.160
And sure, he doesn't know
that much about art...

23:06.369 --> 23:09.068
...but you can always talk about
that with someone else.

23:09.242 --> 23:11.474
-l guess that's true.
-lf you think about it...

23:11.680 --> 23:15.814
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.

23:15.989 --> 23:18.688
You know, that's the kind of guy
Joey is.

23:18.895 --> 23:21.422
He is very sweet.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.262
Plus, he is hot!

23:24.606 --> 23:28.101
That was gonna be my next argument.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.512
-You ready?
-Yeah. Let's go.

23:32.689 --> 23:33.714
Wow!

23:35.494 --> 23:37.658
-Thanks, Ross.
-Yeah.

23:38.835 --> 23:42.467
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.

23:44.245 --> 23:45.544
Glad l could help, man.

23:45.748 --> 23:49.813
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
it would be, but l made it work.

24:00.110 --> 24:04.346
lt is not okay that l'm aroused
by this now.

24:07.993 --> 24:09.018
Hello?

24:09.529 --> 24:12.501
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

24:12.869 --> 24:15.237
No. Well, she's not here...

24:15.407 --> 24:16.933
...but l can tell her.

24:17.111 --> 24:19.878
Should l be sitting down for this?

24:35.180 --> 24:37.777
Well, so, what does that mean?

24:42.662 --> 24:45.030
Okay. Okay, thank you.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.829
Thanks.

24:53.149 --> 24:54.618
Hey, sweetie.

24:55.521 --> 24:57.012
Dr. Connelly just called.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.526
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.

24:59.696 --> 25:01.529
You said, ''Dr. Connelly just called.''

25:01.700 --> 25:04.729
lf it was good, you'd have said,
''Dr. Connelly just called!''

25:04.906 --> 25:07.069
So, what is it? ls it...?

25:07.244 --> 25:11.309
ls there a problem? ls there
a problem with me, or with you?

25:13.056 --> 25:15.253
Actually, it's both of us.

25:16.663 --> 25:18.188
What?

25:18.366 --> 25:21.533
Apparently, my sperm
have low motility...

25:21.707 --> 25:26.581
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.

25:34.766 --> 25:36.861
Well, what does that mean?

25:37.071 --> 25:40.567
lt means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...

25:40.745 --> 25:44.445
...and you have a uterus that is
prepared to kill the ones that do.

25:47.257 --> 25:49.489
-lt means--
-Wait, Chandler.

25:53.771 --> 25:56.607
lt means that we can keep trying...

25:57.244 --> 26:00.945
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.

26:06.663 --> 26:08.633
Oh, my God.

26:10.771 --> 26:12.433
l'm sorry.

26:13.009 --> 26:14.842
l'm sorry too.

26:18.521 --> 26:19.887
Well...

26:20.457 --> 26:23.452
...we're gonna figure this out.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.267
l know.

26:43.938 --> 26:47.742
-Good morning, Phoebe.
-Good morning, receptionist.

26:47.912 --> 26:51.442
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1 .

26:52.187 --> 26:55.888
''Rachel Greene.''
Son of a bitch! She came back?

27:04.078 --> 27:07.448
Are you ready
for your Scottish massage?

27:07.785 --> 27:10.051
Put your face in the hole, lassie!
