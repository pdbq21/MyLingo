00:02.437 --> 00:04.304
God, you're beautiful.

00:05.010 --> 00:07.310
Why are we fighting this?

00:07.648 --> 00:10.346
You know you want it to happen
as much as l do.

00:11.823 --> 00:15.923
l want you. l need you.

00:18.369 --> 00:20.271
Let me make love to you.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.944
l don't wanna stand in the way
of true love or anything...

00:24.114 --> 00:27.450
...but l think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.

00:27.622 --> 00:30.024
No, l'm rehearsing my lines.

00:30.193 --> 00:32.994
They're giving me a romantic story
on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.

00:33.199 --> 00:36.934
lt's the first time my character's gotten one.
l'm nervous. l want it to be good.

00:37.107 --> 00:41.572
l haven't seen you this worked-up since
you did that dog-food commercial...

00:41.783 --> 00:45.985
...and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.

00:46.158 --> 00:48.721
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

00:48.897 --> 00:52.837
You wanna come down to the set
and tell me if l'm doing okay?

00:53.005 --> 00:54.599
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

00:54.809 --> 00:57.610
You just have to promise not
to get thrown out again.

00:57.815 --> 01:00.548
-That was an honest mistake.
-Right.

01:00.721 --> 01:05.128
''Oh, my God. ls this the men's room?
l feel so foolish.

01:05.330 --> 01:09.134
Have you always known
you wanted to be an actor?''

01:10.206 --> 01:13.372
Yeah, that was an awesome day.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.757
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:53.226 --> 01:56.666
You guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant in the next few weeks?

01:56.866 --> 01:59.599
-l'd love to.
-Well, you can't.

02:00.941 --> 02:04.471
-We're booked solid for the next month.
-Well, l can't give you a massage...

02:04.649 --> 02:08.110
...because my license
has been revoked again.

02:08.289 --> 02:11.854
-Phoebe, what happened?
-Well, it was an accident, you know.

02:12.030 --> 02:15.469
lt's a lot of oil and sometimes
the hand just slips.

02:17.842 --> 02:20.507
So the restaurant's doing well, you say?

02:20.681 --> 02:23.447
lt is so great. There are people
lining up in the street...

02:23.620 --> 02:27.024
...to taste my food. Saturday,
there's a waiting list of 50 people.

02:27.193 --> 02:30.324
l know how that feels.
Last semester, l had two students...

02:30.501 --> 02:33.962
...who wanted to take my 1 :00 class,
but it was full.

02:34.141 --> 02:38.047
So they had to take my 5:00.

02:39.819 --> 02:41.412
That's not the same.

02:43.292 --> 02:46.059
Have l got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.

02:46.231 --> 02:50.673
Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed
to get divorced for seven years.

02:52.243 --> 02:55.512
What? No, l'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.

02:55.684 --> 03:01.252
Oh, good. Okay, good for you.
Trying to recapture the magic.

03:02.631 --> 03:04.965
-So can you get out of work?
-Honey, l can't.

03:05.136 --> 03:08.906
-Things are crazy at the restaurant.
-You're really that busy?

03:09.111 --> 03:11.776
Yeah. l'm sorry, l really am.

03:11.950 --> 03:15.286
That's okay. l'll just try and reschedule.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.322
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
l made a reservation there...

03:19.498 --> 03:21.867
...and l need to change it.

03:22.638 --> 03:26.738
What do you mean, it's nonrefundable?
Well, can l just come some other time?

03:27.815 --> 03:29.408
Can't you make an exception?

03:29.585 --> 03:32.420
Tell them l'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.

03:32.625 --> 03:37.032
Tell them that in two weeks, l will once
again be a masseuse in good standing.

03:38.436 --> 03:42.103
Look, this is ridiculous.
l'm not paying for that room, okay?

03:42.277 --> 03:45.147
Well, thank you very much.

03:45.551 --> 03:47.383
Yeah, l'm going to Vermont.

03:48.489 --> 03:52.429
-Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
-l don't have travel insurance.

03:52.631 --> 03:55.762
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.209
-Honey, what are you gonna do?
-l'll go.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.907
Okay, l'll pick you up at 1 0.

04:03.085 --> 04:04.554
Oh, go with you?

04:06.291 --> 04:08.386
Oh, l can't go.

04:10.433 --> 04:12.666
Why don't you take Ross?

04:12.838 --> 04:17.040
Don't you think that'll be a little weird?
l mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

04:17.347 --> 04:21.117
-No, not if the room has two beds.
-l guess.

04:21.288 --> 04:25.228
lt still seems a little--
''Moonlight boat ride''?!

04:30.039 --> 04:33.034
Joey, is this the bed
where Olivia lost her virginity?

04:33.212 --> 04:35.911
l don't know,
but one of the extras sure did.

04:36.084 --> 04:39.546
Listen, Rach. Thanks again
for coming down to watch my scenes.

04:39.759 --> 04:43.254
Please, honey. Just the fact that you
want me here to support you, l'm--

04:43.432 --> 04:48.272
Oh, my God. ls that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!

04:48.475 --> 04:51.140
And also, so gay.

04:51.315 --> 04:55.255
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

04:55.456 --> 04:59.830
Well, at the Christmas party, him
and Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.196
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.431
Okay. All right, wish me luck.

05:04.609 --> 05:08.309
Okay. Not that you need it, but good--
God! ls that Chase Lassiter?

05:08.650 --> 05:11.713
-He's straight, right?
-Rach, if you weren't here wondering...

05:11.889 --> 05:15.487
...if these guys were gay,
l don't know if l could do this.

05:15.664 --> 05:18.795
l'm sorry, you're right.
l'm sorry. Good luck.

05:18.970 --> 05:22.465
On a bell, please. Quietly.

05:22.645 --> 05:24.443
And action!

05:25.684 --> 05:27.779
Drake, what are you doing here?

05:27.955 --> 05:29.822
Stopping you from marrying
the wrong man...

05:29.992 --> 05:32.121
...and making the biggest
mistake of your life.

05:32.296 --> 05:34.391
-Get out.
-You don't love him.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.161
What do you know about love?

05:36.338 --> 05:39.174
l know what l felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.

05:39.344 --> 05:43.011
-That kiss never happened.
-Well, what about this one?

05:45.089 --> 05:47.890
Now, l told you to get out.

05:48.062 --> 05:50.032
Fine, l'll go.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.767
But let me ask you one question.

05:52.938 --> 05:57.208
-You look real familiar. Have we--?
-Shh! He's asking her a question.

05:58.115 --> 06:02.112
Can you live the rest of your life never
knowing what we could have been?

06:02.356 --> 06:05.294
-l don't have a choice.
-Yes, you do.

06:05.463 --> 06:10.064
Yes, you do. l'm the one who doesn't
have a choice because l....

06:10.239 --> 06:11.970
Because l can't stop loving you.

06:13.479 --> 06:17.385
-Don't say that.
-Tell me to stop.

06:17.654 --> 06:19.179
Just...

06:20.259 --> 06:22.320
...tell me to stop.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.332
-Cut!
-No!

06:27.473 --> 06:30.969
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.844
-Everything was delicious.
-Thank you.

06:35.022 --> 06:37.550
lt was. The duck in particular
was superb.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.527
Thank you.

06:42.771 --> 06:44.570
You haven't said anything.

06:45.342 --> 06:47.836
Actually, l do have one small complaint.

06:48.015 --> 06:52.650
Well, please, l welcome criticism.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.594
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.

06:56.799 --> 06:57.926
What musician?

07:17.908 --> 07:19.342
What are you doing here?

07:19.511 --> 07:23.041
You said you had customers lined up
in the street, so l'm here to entertain.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.521
-Great.
-Yeah, it really has been great too.

07:26.692 --> 07:28.628
They must have seen me
play before...

07:28.796 --> 07:31.266
...because they requested
a bunch of my songs.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.803
Yeah, ''You Suck'' ...

07:33.973 --> 07:35.943
...and ''Shut Up and Go Home.''

07:37.748 --> 07:42.246
Listen, Phoebe. You know how much
l love listening to your music...

07:42.423 --> 07:45.259
-...but....
-But what?

07:46.866 --> 07:49.336
This is kind of a classy place.

07:50.807 --> 07:52.139
Okay, say no more.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.014
Everyone!

08:03.098 --> 08:04.761
Classy, huh?

08:10.346 --> 08:12.316
Hi, Chandler Bing. l have a reservation.

08:12.483 --> 08:15.387
Welcome to the Chestnut lnn.
Where are you joining us from?

08:15.557 --> 08:17.789
-New York.
-The Big Apple.

08:18.730 --> 08:22.761
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.

08:22.938 --> 08:26.206
l ate all my gifts for everybody.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.983
l'm sorry, there's no record
of your reservation in the computer.

08:31.187 --> 08:35.355
-That's impossible. Check again, please.
-Check again, please.

08:36.932 --> 08:40.063
-l'm sorry, it's not here.
-lt's not there.

08:40.740 --> 08:44.270
Let me get this straight. l called
to try to cancel my reservation...

08:44.447 --> 08:48.285
...was told it's not refundable. Then we
drove six hours all the way up here...

08:48.455 --> 08:51.622
-...and now we don't have a reservation?
-l don't know what to say.

08:51.829 --> 08:54.061
She doesn't know what to say.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.362
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.

08:56.572 --> 09:00.603
The only thing we have available
is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

09:00.780 --> 09:03.216
-That's insane.
-lt's totally insane.

09:03.385 --> 09:07.416
Dude, let's drive home. We'll hit all the
maple-candy stores on the way back...

09:07.594 --> 09:12.228
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.

09:13.806 --> 09:17.267
Does that room have a closet
l can lock him in?

09:18.516 --> 09:21.316
-We'll take it.
-Great.

09:21.822 --> 09:24.953
They are totally ripping us off!
Three hundred dollars each?

09:25.129 --> 09:26.860
''Each?'' l'm your date.

09:29.538 --> 09:32.304
So l pay for everything
and have no sex.

09:32.476 --> 09:35.243
Oh, life before Monica.

09:35.482 --> 09:36.781
Dude, don't worry about it.

09:36.952 --> 09:41.017
l know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

09:41.194 --> 09:46.000
We just load up on those.
Like those apples. lnstead of taking one...

09:46.171 --> 09:48.403
...l take six.

09:49.010 --> 09:52.711
Great. At $ 1 00 an apple, we're there.

09:52.884 --> 09:57.188
Come on, you get the idea. You know,
we'll make our money back in no time.

09:57.393 --> 10:00.889
-Dude, you're shaking.
-lt's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

10:06.444 --> 10:07.845
-Hi.
-Hey.

10:08.014 --> 10:12.820
Joey, l gotta tell you, l have been
thinking all day about that scene you did.

10:12.991 --> 10:15.120
l mean, you were amazing.

10:15.362 --> 10:18.631
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.

10:18.803 --> 10:20.932
And my costar's good.

10:21.107 --> 10:23.134
But they're not as good as me!

10:24.648 --> 10:26.777
You have to tell me
what happens tomorrow.

10:26.986 --> 10:29.685
l'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?

10:29.958 --> 10:33.419
Me? Oh, l'm not an actress.

10:33.599 --> 10:37.470
-All right, l can ask Monica.
-Screw her! That part is mine!

10:37.641 --> 10:40.407
Okay, so just from the top
of the page right here.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.208
Okay.

10:45.289 --> 10:48.660
Hello, Drake.
l'm surprised to see you here.

10:48.829 --> 10:52.097
-l can't believe you married him.
-Well, what choice did l have?

10:52.303 --> 10:55.572
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

10:58.214 --> 11:01.482
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?

11:01.655 --> 11:04.125
lt's over. You have to accept that.

11:04.327 --> 11:08.792
How can l, knowing l'll never
hold you in my arms again...

11:08.969 --> 11:13.069
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...

11:13.612 --> 11:16.242
...knowing l'll never make love to you?

11:16.919 --> 11:19.914
How can l accept
that l can never kiss you again...

11:20.092 --> 11:23.121
...when it's all l can do
not to kiss you right now?

11:26.437 --> 11:27.633
Kiss me.

11:28.876 --> 11:30.310
What?

11:31.381 --> 11:32.748
Kiss me.

11:33.786 --> 11:37.658
-Rach, it doesn't say that.
-No, l'm saying it.

11:38.461 --> 11:41.297
-But--
-Just don't talk.

11:48.448 --> 11:50.418
Well, that's new.

11:58.101 --> 12:01.563
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

12:01.775 --> 12:03.540
l've forgotten a couple of things.

12:03.712 --> 12:07.982
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?

12:08.188 --> 12:11.958
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

12:12.129 --> 12:18.165
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
Band-Aids, shaving cream, after-shave.

12:18.341 --> 12:20.402
And l feel like l'm forgetting something.

12:20.580 --> 12:24.611
ls there anything else you have
that l haven't asked for already?

12:25.523 --> 12:28.757
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.796
-What'd you get?
-<i>USA Today.</i>

12:32.971 --> 12:34.998
Nice. Put it with the others.

12:35.242 --> 12:39.182
And l also got two more apples.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.319
We're four short of a bushel!

12:42.289 --> 12:46.320
God, l feel so alive.
l love being in the country!

12:46.497 --> 12:48.832
Also, got these great
salt and pepper shakers...

12:49.003 --> 12:51.337
-...from the restaurant.
-That's not cool.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.242
Dude, none of this is cool.

12:55.816 --> 12:59.380
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...

12:59.558 --> 13:01.858
...and taking what the hotel owes you.

13:02.029 --> 13:04.865
For example: A hair dryer, no, no.

13:05.068 --> 13:08.165
But shampoos and conditioners,
yes, yes.

13:09.443 --> 13:12.905
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.

13:13.084 --> 13:17.024
But the salt....

13:17.192 --> 13:19.094
l wish l'd thought this through.

13:20.098 --> 13:24.129
l think l get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

13:24.340 --> 13:27.507
...but the bulbs--
Oh, you already got that.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.618
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

13:30.786 --> 13:33.553
-Okay, how about this?
-No, no, no.

13:33.726 --> 13:38.224
-You can't take the remote control.
-Yes, but the batteries.

13:43.311 --> 13:44.974
Thank you. Thank you very much.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.646
-Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
-No!

13:50.025 --> 13:51.995
At least tell me where you hid it.

13:57.039 --> 13:59.977
-Can l ask you a question?
-Yeah.

14:00.278 --> 14:03.273
Have you ever had any...

14:03.451 --> 14:07.984
...weird, romantic dreams?

14:09.229 --> 14:10.823
Let me think.

14:11.033 --> 14:16.305
When l was younger, l used to dream
that l got married to Mayor McCheese.

14:16.477 --> 14:19.541
And on our wedding night,
l ate his head.

14:21.187 --> 14:22.850
Okay.

14:23.692 --> 14:26.162
Well, this is like that...

14:26.330 --> 14:28.232
...in no way.

14:28.401 --> 14:32.364
l had a dream last night
that l wanted to kiss Joey.

14:32.543 --> 14:35.515
Wow! You mean like
''kiss him'' kiss him?

14:35.683 --> 14:39.019
Oh, yeah.
l mean, it was pretty intense.

14:39.223 --> 14:41.352
-What brought that on?
-l don't know.

14:41.528 --> 14:44.557
Maybe it had to do with the fact
l saw him do a love scene.

14:44.768 --> 14:47.102
-A love scene? With who?
-Olivia.

14:47.272 --> 14:50.575
Olivia?! l thought she was
marrying Connor?!

14:50.746 --> 14:53.877
Oh, right. Real life more important.

14:54.086 --> 14:57.526
-You think my dream means anything?
-l don't know.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.925
l mean, you saw him do a love scene.

15:00.098 --> 15:04.004
So maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

15:07.747 --> 15:12.188
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.

15:12.355 --> 15:16.125
Of course it was. Trust me,
when it comes to psychology...

15:16.297 --> 15:19.532
...l know what l'm talking about.

15:19.704 --> 15:21.901
l took two psych classes in college.

15:22.075 --> 15:23.908
You took the same class twice.

15:24.079 --> 15:26.642
-lt was hard!
-l know.

15:27.319 --> 15:29.654
-Hey.
-Hi, Phoebe.

15:29.824 --> 15:34.288
Here, Monica, look what l got to wear
when l play at your restaurant.

15:39.109 --> 15:40.407
Wait.

15:42.850 --> 15:47.690
Right? l think this might even class up
''The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man.''

15:50.532 --> 15:52.160
Phoebe...

15:52.335 --> 15:54.829
...maybe l wasn't clear before.

15:55.441 --> 15:58.937
l really love listening
to your music here.

15:59.149 --> 16:02.019
But my restaurant,
it's sort of an upscale place.

16:02.222 --> 16:06.960
Right, yeah, okay. l'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

16:07.165 --> 16:10.035
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.869
lt's sort of your songs.

16:13.545 --> 16:16.608
l just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.

16:19.389 --> 16:22.293
Okay. Fine, l'll just--

16:22.462 --> 16:24.489
l'll take the hat back.

16:27.105 --> 16:28.802
There.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.651
Hey, so, you guys, the funniest
thing happened at work the--

16:37.827 --> 16:39.990
My songs aren't good enough
for your restaurant?

16:40.164 --> 16:42.761
Okay, we're still on that.

16:42.970 --> 16:46.465
-l didn't say they weren't good enough.
-Then what's wrong with them?

16:46.644 --> 16:49.775
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?

16:50.819 --> 16:53.289
-Tiny portions?
-Yeah, well, ''Excuse me.

16:53.457 --> 16:58.662
l ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but l can't see it. l can't see it.''

17:00.806 --> 17:04.769
-Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
-Well, it's not about quality.

17:05.682 --> 17:08.016
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?

17:08.220 --> 17:12.559
Have you ever heard of a ''key''?
lt's what some people sing in.

17:12.730 --> 17:16.693
Well, at least all my songs
don't taste like garlic.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.398
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.

17:20.445 --> 17:22.039
So that's what we're doing.

17:22.215 --> 17:25.210
When l'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...

17:25.388 --> 17:26.789
...l'm wearing earplugs.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.121
Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

17:31.066 --> 17:33.263
You know what?
l take back what l said before.

17:33.437 --> 17:37.275
Keep playing at the restaurant, because
with your music driving people inside...

17:37.445 --> 17:39.244
...my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.

17:39.416 --> 17:42.388
What are people having,
the garlic martini?

17:50.639 --> 17:52.403
So you wanna hear my work story?

17:52.910 --> 17:53.969
l'll save it.

17:56.718 --> 17:59.018
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

17:59.189 --> 18:01.854
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.771
-l didn't factor in the room tax.
-Dude, don't worry about it.

18:08.942 --> 18:12.346
l found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.

18:14.186 --> 18:16.486
-Oh, my God.
-What?

18:16.658 --> 18:19.288
There's something new in the bowl.

18:19.462 --> 18:24.268
-Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
-No, but l want the pine cones.

18:25.141 --> 18:28.876
-There's a forest right outside.
-lt's not the same.

18:29.115 --> 18:32.451
-No, look. She's gonna see us.
-No, she won't. l'm sly.

18:32.923 --> 18:34.916
Okay, go quick.

18:42.408 --> 18:45.244
Thank you for a delightful stay.

18:53.732 --> 18:54.995
My maple candy!

19:07.458 --> 19:12.264
lt's just you. l thought someone was
swinging a bag of cats against the wall.

19:12.569 --> 19:16.235
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

19:17.278 --> 19:19.806
-Okay, you have to stop playing now.
-Why?

19:19.984 --> 19:22.284
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.

19:22.455 --> 19:27.660
-Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
-Get your garlic peelers off me.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.270
Excuse me? Excuse me?

19:30.438 --> 19:33.969
Hi, l'm Monica Geller.
l'm the head chef here.

19:34.613 --> 19:38.143
Okay, l was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.121
Quick question.
By a show of hands...

19:41.293 --> 19:44.892
...how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?

19:46.336 --> 19:49.503
Okay, okay. Well, l have a question.

19:49.810 --> 19:51.073
You can put your hand down.

19:51.246 --> 19:55.277
You made your point earlier
when you spit in my guitar case.

19:56.557 --> 20:00.360
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?

20:01.734 --> 20:05.104
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...

20:05.274 --> 20:07.745
...but not in keeping with the tone
of the restaurant?

20:08.581 --> 20:14.719
Okay, well, who identified this restaurant's
tone as ''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?

20:14.894 --> 20:21.032
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?

20:21.774 --> 20:25.269
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...

20:25.448 --> 20:28.979
...but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?

20:32.629 --> 20:33.927
Excuse us.

20:37.606 --> 20:39.803
All right, here's a question.

20:40.645 --> 20:44.015
Who was so worried about
her restaurant being fancy...

20:44.185 --> 20:47.385
...that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...

20:47.593 --> 20:50.861
...and feels really bad about it now?

20:51.901 --> 20:54.497
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...

20:54.673 --> 20:57.143
...that she lashed out
against her friend's cooking...

20:57.311 --> 20:59.976
...which she actually thinks
is pretty great?

21:00.819 --> 21:03.757
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry too.

21:04.058 --> 21:07.030
Hey, you wanna stick around
and l'll whip you up some dinner?

21:07.231 --> 21:09.064
Yeah, as long as it's free.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.832
The food here is ridiculously overpr--

21:14.580 --> 21:18.314
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
cute enough that you won't hate me?

21:22.094 --> 21:23.825
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:25.134 --> 21:29.199
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?

21:32.248 --> 21:35.482
Oh, man. l thought l got it all.

21:36.924 --> 21:38.415
How...?

21:38.595 --> 21:40.393
How?

21:40.632 --> 21:43.102
l was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?

21:43.270 --> 21:47.438
l couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.

21:47.613 --> 21:51.781
And l thought, ''Well, you know,
how important can that be?'' Right?

21:52.355 --> 21:54.120
Turns out, very.

21:55.895 --> 21:57.865
Wow, definitely just Drake.

21:58.467 --> 22:00.700
-What?
-How's it going with Drake?

22:01.807 --> 22:04.175
-l don't think it's going very well.
-What?

22:04.379 --> 22:06.212
That scene l saw was so good.

22:06.416 --> 22:11.051
Well, l'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.

22:11.359 --> 22:15.493
ls this that thing you do when you say
you're bad so l'll give you a compliment?

22:15.835 --> 22:17.600
A little.

22:18.006 --> 22:24.383
No, l really am worried. l have to make it
convincing that l'm in love with Olivia.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.548
-So?
-So l've never played that.

22:27.726 --> 22:31.564
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
l mean, you've been in love before.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.605
Well, just once...

22:35.775 --> 22:37.540
...with you.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.917
Okay. Well, this could be
a little awkward.

22:42.088 --> 22:44.422
l'm just gonna blow past it.

22:44.593 --> 22:47.622
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...

22:47.866 --> 22:51.430
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?

22:52.909 --> 22:55.311
What the hell are you talking about?

22:58.621 --> 23:03.620
All right, look, just try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...

23:03.798 --> 23:07.293
...and think about that
when you're playing the scene.

23:09.543 --> 23:12.845
Okay. Yeah, l think l can do that.

23:13.016 --> 23:16.113
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.

23:16.289 --> 23:18.556
And Olivia and her husband are there...

23:18.728 --> 23:23.066
...and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.

23:24.071 --> 23:28.638
That makes me think about those times
l wanted to grab you and kiss you...

23:28.815 --> 23:32.083
...but you didn't know, so l would
just pretend everything was cool...

23:32.254 --> 23:34.315
...but really it was killing me.

23:36.329 --> 23:40.360
Joey, you never
talked about that before.

23:42.474 --> 23:45.002
Hey, you know what else l could use?

23:45.615 --> 23:48.951
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

23:49.121 --> 23:52.321
...and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.

23:54.900 --> 23:59.899
l mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.

24:01.279 --> 24:02.748
You know?

24:02.916 --> 24:07.915
And l remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...

24:08.093 --> 24:13.468
...when l would think to myself,
''My God, she is beautiful.''

24:15.173 --> 24:19.615
And it hurt so much because
l knew l could never tell you.

24:22.956 --> 24:27.226
But it was worth it just to be there
looking at you.

24:33.611 --> 24:35.513
Thanks, dude. This is great!

24:45.902 --> 24:48.236
l got you something from Vermont.

24:48.406 --> 24:50.604
Besides tampons and salt?

24:52.181 --> 24:53.912
Oh, my God.

24:54.085 --> 24:57.684
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

24:58.728 --> 25:00.721
That's weird, it's empty.

25:01.065 --> 25:05.530
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or...?

25:12.655 --> 25:14.557
Do you guys hear a buzzing?
