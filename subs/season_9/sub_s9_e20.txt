00:01.903 --> 00:04.704
Hey, you guys?
What are you doing tomorrow night?

00:04.876 --> 00:08.110
Oh, well, let me see.
l believe l'm....

00:08.282 --> 00:10.445
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

00:11.556 --> 00:14.858
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.659
l could fall asleep at a play.

00:17.802 --> 00:19.863
-What is it?
-lt's a one-woman play called:

00:20.040 --> 00:24.105
<i>Why Don't You Like Me?</i>
<i>A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.</i>

00:24.749 --> 00:27.413
-That sounds interesting.
-That does sound interesting.

00:27.588 --> 00:32.188
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. l don't think it gets bet--

00:33.734 --> 00:37.070
l know! l know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.734
What more do these broads want?

00:40.581 --> 00:43.074
Well, you guys will have a great time.
l promise.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.983
What? How come you don't have to go?

00:45.156 --> 00:46.750
l wish l could, but l found out...

00:46.927 --> 00:50.422
...that l have to be at work really early
the next day, so l can't go.

00:50.601 --> 00:53.197
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

00:53.941 --> 00:56.343
Let's see. Who do l hate?

00:58.550 --> 00:59.950
Oh, sorry.

01:00.286 --> 01:01.721
-Oops, sorry.
-Okay.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.483
-Okay.
-Okay. Up we go.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.857
-Oh, gosh, okay!
-All right.

01:15.518 --> 01:17.818
Can l ask you a question?

01:18.222 --> 01:22.060
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

01:22.230 --> 01:25.498
...and not have it be a big deal?

01:26.873 --> 01:29.400
No, l don't think that ever works. Why?

01:30.413 --> 01:32.884
-No reason.
-No, no. Rachel?

01:33.186 --> 01:36.853
-Who do you want to fool around with?
-Nobody! Forget it.

01:37.127 --> 01:38.425
Joey?

01:39.064 --> 01:40.795
Maybe.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.361
-You can't.
-Why?

01:43.540 --> 01:45.065
Because!

01:48.249 --> 01:50.948
Okay, seriously, did not understand
a word you just said.

01:52.758 --> 01:54.990
-ln the hall.
-Okay.

01:57.668 --> 01:59.570
-You wanna fool around with Joey?
-Yeah.

01:59.739 --> 02:03.269
Ever since l had that dream about him,
l can't get it out of my head.

02:03.446 --> 02:06.077
l mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.917
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

02:09.091 --> 02:13.327
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.

02:13.499 --> 02:16.232
-Who are they?
-l know them from work.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.140
-Both of them?
-No, just one of them.

02:19.311 --> 02:21.110
Which one?

02:21.516 --> 02:24.214
l don't know.
What were the names l just said?

02:24.388 --> 02:27.155
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

02:27.327 --> 02:30.789
All right. You're right. l won't do anything
with Joey. l just thought it--

02:30.968 --> 02:35.842
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
one pound of baking soda and a red onion?

02:37.314 --> 02:39.011
What the hell are you cooking?

03:31.890 --> 03:34.760
You guys won't believe
what l have to do for work today.

03:34.962 --> 03:39.494
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

03:40.574 --> 03:44.069
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

03:44.782 --> 03:48.243
...and l have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

03:48.422 --> 03:49.584
What's so bad about that?

03:49.759 --> 03:52.457
l just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

03:52.631 --> 03:56.195
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

03:57.207 --> 03:58.266
Ross?

03:58.442 --> 04:01.141
What? These aren't suede.

04:04.755 --> 04:07.784
Excuse me. l'm looking for someone.

04:07.962 --> 04:10.991
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.466
No.

04:15.844 --> 04:19.078
Hi. Hi, l'm Ross Geller.

04:19.251 --> 04:21.984
Oh, hi. l'm Professor Wheeler.

04:23.192 --> 04:26.460
Oh, that's-- That's--
That's nice.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.465
lt's good to meet you.

04:28.637 --> 04:31.507
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

04:31.676 --> 04:33.509
No, it's no big deal.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.449
lf l weren't doing this, l'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

04:39.124 --> 04:40.353
ls he gonna introduce us?

04:40.527 --> 04:43.863
l think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

04:44.802 --> 04:47.034
By the way,
l really enjoyed your paper...

04:47.206 --> 04:51.671
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

04:52.150 --> 04:54.815
l wrote that in one night.

04:56.526 --> 04:59.053
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.366
Well, we should probably get going.

05:03.272 --> 05:05.333
You know, we've got a lot
of ground to cover.

05:05.510 --> 05:08.208
lsn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

05:09.017 --> 05:11.078
l don't think so.

05:11.455 --> 05:14.086
l'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

05:14.260 --> 05:17.357
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

05:17.534 --> 05:21.473
lf you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

05:21.676 --> 05:24.807
An option that many of my students use.

05:25.717 --> 05:27.778
-Shall we?
-We shouldn't wait for him?

05:27.955 --> 05:31.223
You know what, he's a big boy.
l'm sure he'll find us, okay?

05:31.395 --> 05:33.798
-Professor Geller?
-Oh, damn it!

05:44.354 --> 05:47.155
<i>Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.</i>
<i>Can't wait for your party tonight.</i>

05:47.326 --> 05:51.961
<i>Listen, I forgot your address.</i>
<i>Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.</i>

05:55.376 --> 05:56.606
What's happening?

05:57.681 --> 06:01.051
lt's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

06:01.221 --> 06:04.284
l'd love to, but l gotta get up
so early the next day.

06:04.461 --> 06:08.162
-You know me, work comes first.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:09.304 --> 06:13.210
<i>Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.</i>
<i>Can't wait for your party tonight.</i>

06:15.015 --> 06:17.315
Stupid Jan Rogers!

06:18.322 --> 06:20.292
You are having a party tonight?

06:20.459 --> 06:22.053
-No.
-Joey!

06:22.230 --> 06:23.859
Yeah.

06:24.033 --> 06:27.199
l'm kind of having a thing
for the <i>Days of Our Lives</i> people.

06:27.373 --> 06:28.740
And you weren't gonna tell us?

06:28.910 --> 06:31.346
How did you think you were
gonna get away with that?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.348
l do it every year.

06:34.989 --> 06:37.016
You do that every year?!

06:37.193 --> 06:39.322
l didn't have to tell you that!

06:39.698 --> 06:42.396
God, l'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

06:43.405 --> 06:46.606
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

06:46.779 --> 06:47.872
Yeah.

06:48.048 --> 06:51.487
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

06:51.656 --> 06:52.885
Yeah.

06:53.793 --> 06:58.359
And the year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

06:58.536 --> 07:01.667
l can't believe you guys went
for that one.

07:01.843 --> 07:04.109
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

07:04.682 --> 07:08.588
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

07:08.756 --> 07:11.694
Well, then, so just invite me.

07:12.230 --> 07:15.464
Please, l was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

07:15.637 --> 07:19.634
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. l will behave. l promise.

07:19.812 --> 07:23.307
-l will behave. Please, please, please.
-Okay, fine. You can come.

07:23.485 --> 07:27.118
But don't tell anybody else.
lt's up on the roof at <i>8</i>.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.886
A soap-opera roof party?!

07:29.063 --> 07:32.696
l'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:35.376 --> 07:37.471
And it's out of my system.

07:43.125 --> 07:48.694
And then my wife and l went
on a cruise to the Galápagos.

07:48.870 --> 07:53.106
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

07:53.478 --> 07:58.386
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

07:58.556 --> 08:00.856
...and cracked crab...

08:01.027 --> 08:03.190
...and snow crab...

08:03.365 --> 08:05.859
...and king crab.

08:06.037 --> 08:09.237
lt's a pity l'm allergic to shellfish.

08:10.747 --> 08:13.685
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

08:13.853 --> 08:17.588
-And that's not all l'm allergic to.
-Oh, it's not over.

08:17.761 --> 08:21.895
l'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

08:22.069 --> 08:24.301
...and almonds and filberts--

08:24.474 --> 08:26.068
So basically all nuts!

08:26.378 --> 08:28.542
lnterestingly, no.

08:29.317 --> 08:33.189
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word ''interesting.''

08:34.895 --> 08:37.526
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to use the restroom.

08:37.701 --> 08:39.728
When l come back,
remind me to tell you...

08:39.905 --> 08:44.677
...about the different types
of animal dander l'm allergic to.

08:46.585 --> 08:48.851
Oh, my God!

08:49.057 --> 08:51.220
l've lost the will to live.

08:52.931 --> 08:54.422
-Let's ditch him.
-What?

08:54.601 --> 08:57.299
While he's still in the bathroom.
l am begging you.

08:57.473 --> 09:01.277
Okay. Okay, fine,
but l just have one question for you.

09:01.448 --> 09:04.512
When we exit, should we walk or run...

09:04.721 --> 09:06.987
...or prance or stroll--?

09:07.159 --> 09:10.599
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

09:19.618 --> 09:24.423
-We actually managed to salvage the day.
-Yeah, we did.

09:24.595 --> 09:26.997
Thanks for spending
so much time with me.

09:27.166 --> 09:30.468
l'm so lucky it worked out
you don't have class on Tuesday.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.869
Right.

09:36.685 --> 09:38.985
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

09:39.190 --> 09:42.026
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

09:42.196 --> 09:45.362
-Hi.
-Charlie will be joining my department.

09:45.537 --> 09:47.734
-You're a paleontologist too?
-Yeah.

09:48.041 --> 09:50.068
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

09:50.245 --> 09:54.584
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

09:56.457 --> 10:01.229
Well, l think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.874
Oh, l'm sorry. l have to take this.
Excuse me.

10:05.108 --> 10:07.739
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

10:07.914 --> 10:12.014
l saw the article on your coffee table.
l memorized the title to freak you out.

10:15.229 --> 10:16.892
So did you two have fun?

10:17.066 --> 10:19.560
Oh, my God. She's great.

10:19.738 --> 10:24.042
We have so much in common,
and she's just cool, you know? And funny.

10:24.213 --> 10:27.846
And l don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

10:28.221 --> 10:29.588
Hi!

10:35.402 --> 10:39.206
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
l'm not feeling really well...

10:39.377 --> 10:42.817
...and l don't think l'm gonna get
to go to the play.

10:42.984 --> 10:44.316
Really? What's wrong?

10:44.487 --> 10:46.685
l don't know.
l think it's kind of serious.

10:46.859 --> 10:50.320
You know, l was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

10:50.499 --> 10:54.736
...about Newcastle disease,
and l think l might have it.

10:55.108 --> 10:57.602
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

10:57.814 --> 11:00.547
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

11:02.724 --> 11:04.488
Okay, who's this?

11:05.028 --> 11:08.364
l'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

11:08.536 --> 11:10.437
Hi. Well, l would shake your hand...

11:10.606 --> 11:13.908
...but l'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

11:14.447 --> 11:17.648
-Rachel, can l see you for a second?
-Sure.

11:22.897 --> 11:24.126
You're not sick.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.266
What? Yes, l am!

11:26.437 --> 11:28.874
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

11:31.013 --> 11:34.919
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

11:36.525 --> 11:39.861
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

11:40.031 --> 11:42.764
No, l heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

11:42.937 --> 11:44.907
Okay, then what is this?

11:45.910 --> 11:47.310
Okay.

11:48.014 --> 11:51.180
Joey is having a secret
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> party up on the roof.

11:51.354 --> 11:53.882
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

11:54.326 --> 11:56.057
What?!

11:56.865 --> 11:58.128
What? What's going on?

11:58.301 --> 12:01.934
Joey is having a secret
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> party up on the roof!

12:02.109 --> 12:06.551
He didn't want you to know about it,
but l came over here to tell you.

12:07.152 --> 12:10.648
-You came to say you were sick.
-All right, professor or detective?

12:11.762 --> 12:15.394
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

12:15.570 --> 12:19.168
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

12:19.343 --> 12:23.512
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

12:23.686 --> 12:25.986
And that horrible museum tour?

12:26.290 --> 12:28.123
No, l arranged that.

12:31.702 --> 12:34.902
Hey, you guys, l'm turning in.
Have fun.

12:38.314 --> 12:40.011
We know about your party, Joey.

12:40.185 --> 12:43.716
-What party?
-The game's over. Take off your robe.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.660
Okay, l mean....

12:49.236 --> 12:52.072
Close it up! Close it up!

12:54.614 --> 12:55.912
Nice to meet you.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.336
Hey, you made it! All right!

13:06.505 --> 13:08.702
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

13:09.076 --> 13:12.048
-Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
-Hi.

13:12.717 --> 13:14.447
l love you!

13:14.621 --> 13:18.287
Hey. That's why l didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

13:18.494 --> 13:20.464
Just go get yourself a drink
or something.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.537
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

13:24.608 --> 13:27.374
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

13:27.547 --> 13:29.072
l can barely control myself.

13:29.249 --> 13:31.880
Monica, you might want to remember
that you're married.

13:32.055 --> 13:34.287
Where is Chandler anyway?

13:34.460 --> 13:35.986
Oh, my God! Chandler!

13:42.644 --> 13:45.410
Where the hell is everybody?

13:47.587 --> 13:50.251
<i>Why Don't You Like Me?</i>

13:54.166 --> 13:57.468
Chapter 1 : My First Period.

14:02.082 --> 14:04.143
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

14:04.319 --> 14:06.448
But if she's getting one,
l want one too!

14:06.625 --> 14:10.690
''To Monica.'' And none of this
''best wishes'' crap. l want ''love.''

14:11.501 --> 14:15.908
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

14:16.077 --> 14:18.913
Oh, man! lf l had known
l was coming to this party...

14:19.116 --> 14:20.983
...l never would've gotten married!

14:22.122 --> 14:24.115
-lt was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

14:24.293 --> 14:26.490
-Call me.
-We will!

14:28.234 --> 14:32.801
Look at you with all the guys!
l guess you've forgotten all about Joey.

14:32.977 --> 14:35.744
Yeah, well, l guess l have forgotten
about Joey.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.318
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

14:39.323 --> 14:41.418
Please. Chandler's the love of my life.

14:41.628 --> 14:43.689
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

14:47.072 --> 14:50.169
So do you get to go
to things like this often?

14:50.345 --> 14:52.406
Come on, this is New York.

14:52.583 --> 14:56.113
l mean, one night you're at a rooftop
party filled with soap stars...

14:56.290 --> 14:58.487
...and the next night, you're....

14:59.096 --> 15:01.362
Who am l kidding, this is so cool.

15:02.770 --> 15:06.231
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

15:06.410 --> 15:10.282
Actually, l'm kind of happy to be leaving.
l just broke up with someone.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.718
Oh, so sad.

15:13.257 --> 15:15.956
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

15:16.130 --> 15:20.195
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

15:20.639 --> 15:23.439
Actually, Albie is the guy
l broke up with.

15:23.612 --> 15:26.709
-You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
-Yeah.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.823
And you called him ''Albie''?

15:30.659 --> 15:34.861
l mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein....

15:35.669 --> 15:37.069
Albie.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.739
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

15:40.913 --> 15:43.076
You think?
l mean, you dated the guy...

15:43.284 --> 15:46.587
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 1 0!

15:46.758 --> 15:51.222
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

15:51.400 --> 15:53.063
...he had a lot of issues.

15:53.237 --> 15:55.104
Oh, like what?

15:55.509 --> 15:58.675
l'm sorry. l don't mean to pry.
lt's just that this must be...

15:58.849 --> 16:02.983
...what regular people experience
when they watch <i>Access Hollywood.</i>

16:03.457 --> 16:05.222
Okay, you want the dirt?

16:05.395 --> 16:07.525
Albie was seriously insecure.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.900
He was really intimidated by the guy
l dated before him.

16:11.073 --> 16:14.477
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

16:14.647 --> 16:16.640
A guy who won two.

16:17.218 --> 16:18.481
Two? What--?

16:18.655 --> 16:21.627
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

16:21.795 --> 16:23.697
Yeah, for three years.

16:23.865 --> 16:25.265
Oh, my God.

16:26.103 --> 16:30.441
Have you ever been in a relationship with
someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

16:31.915 --> 16:33.509
No.

16:34.319 --> 16:36.448
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

16:36.624 --> 16:38.958
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

16:39.129 --> 16:42.397
No, but he did just win
the MacArthur ''genius grant.''

16:43.337 --> 16:45.432
What a loser.

16:47.012 --> 16:48.914
Some more wine?

16:53.090 --> 16:55.527
Hey, Ross. How's it going with Charlie?

16:55.696 --> 16:57.563
Oh, great. After l finish my wine...

16:57.733 --> 17:01.673
...l'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

17:02.142 --> 17:03.405
What's the matter?

17:03.578 --> 17:08.212
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

17:08.387 --> 17:11.188
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

17:11.360 --> 17:15.699
...l put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.105
l always loved that.

17:18.274 --> 17:21.770
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

17:23.250 --> 17:25.949
l can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

17:26.123 --> 17:28.651
They're so out of my league.

17:29.129 --> 17:30.290
Oh, my God!

17:30.465 --> 17:32.435
-Worse?
-Oh, much, much worse.

17:32.603 --> 17:36.668
l did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

17:36.845 --> 17:38.074
''Can we walk?''

17:40.284 --> 17:42.585
-Oh, you like that?
-No.

17:42.756 --> 17:43.985
What?

17:44.159 --> 17:47.495
Come on! l think that's funny!

17:48.167 --> 17:49.796
Woolly mammoth.

17:49.971 --> 17:51.668
lt's good!

17:53.812 --> 17:57.946
l bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.785
Oh, yes. God, yes.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.296
Well, you're not gonna get one!

18:03.464 --> 18:06.835
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

18:08.140 --> 18:11.910
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

18:13.752 --> 18:16.245
How could he leave me?!

18:17.993 --> 18:20.658
l don't know. You seem lovely.

18:27.646 --> 18:31.882
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

18:32.055 --> 18:34.457
-Nice to meet you.
-So, what show are you on?

18:34.627 --> 18:38.031
l'm not an actor.
l'm a professor of paleontology.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.599
That's science.

18:41.173 --> 18:43.906
Hey, well, listen,
l play a scientist on <i>Days.</i>

18:44.079 --> 18:46.949
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

18:48.888 --> 18:53.762
Ross, Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you guys are together?

18:55.001 --> 18:56.230
Well, no, but....

18:56.403 --> 19:00.309
l mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

19:00.478 --> 19:03.610
Hey, l got a 690 on my SATs.

19:05.321 --> 19:06.915
l'd lead with that.

19:09.229 --> 19:11.996
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

19:12.870 --> 19:13.929
Monica!

19:14.372 --> 19:17.242
Don't worry, Joe.
l won't come next year!

19:21.654 --> 19:22.917
What the--?

19:23.090 --> 19:24.353
What do you got there?

19:24.527 --> 19:27.020
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

19:27.198 --> 19:29.464
Oh, really? Let me see.

19:30.271 --> 19:32.674
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

19:32.843 --> 19:34.277
Are you a little slutty?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.150
l think l am.

19:39.322 --> 19:42.317
Let me see if l approve
of any of these clowns.

19:42.495 --> 19:44.728
-This guy wears a rug.
-Well....

19:44.900 --> 19:47.336
This guy's Canadian.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.402
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

19:50.579 --> 19:54.484
lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and l don't feel any different.

19:56.958 --> 19:59.019
Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.

19:59.195 --> 20:02.395
-Why? What's wrong with these guys?
-Well, nothing major.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.905
lt's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

20:06.076 --> 20:07.545
...and you deserve the best.

20:08.515 --> 20:10.781
Joey, you're so sweet.

20:10.952 --> 20:15.325
lt's true, but it doesn't matter. l already
know who you're going home with.

20:15.494 --> 20:17.225
Who?

20:20.772 --> 20:22.172
Me.

20:22.341 --> 20:23.901
What?

20:24.479 --> 20:26.244
Really?

20:26.584 --> 20:29.750
Yeah, because we live together.
lt's a joke! lt's a joke.

20:29.924 --> 20:32.190
Right! That's funny! l get it!

20:32.361 --> 20:35.299
-Got you!
-You're funny, Joey.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.567
Oh, my God.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.384
So how did you enjoy the play?

20:46.891 --> 20:51.799
Oh, my God.
Honey, l am so, so, so, so sorry.

20:51.968 --> 20:52.993
Well, you should be.

20:53.170 --> 20:57.338
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

20:57.513 --> 21:00.679
-You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah. l mean, at first l hated it.

21:00.852 --> 21:05.054
But why wouldn't l? Because as a man,
l've been trained not to listen!

21:08.033 --> 21:10.060
But after Chapter 1 6:

21:10.237 --> 21:12.902
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

21:14.078 --> 21:16.207
...l was uplifted.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.377
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.

21:18.555 --> 21:21.823
l had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

21:22.228 --> 21:25.998
Tell me--
Tell me about your first period.

21:27.706 --> 21:29.004
No!

21:30.712 --> 21:32.340
Did somebody sign your bra?

21:32.516 --> 21:36.513
So l got it when l was 1 3.
Very difficult.

21:37.726 --> 21:42.394
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

21:42.569 --> 21:46.235
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

21:46.409 --> 21:48.744
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

21:48.915 --> 21:50.976
lt's actually a million-dollar prize.

21:51.252 --> 21:53.313
Go, Charlie!

21:53.891 --> 21:56.259
But my point is...

21:56.429 --> 22:00.335
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

22:00.538 --> 22:06.072
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

22:07.451 --> 22:12.086
Yeah, maybe, and l do have
my whole career in front of me.

22:12.261 --> 22:13.696
l mean....

22:13.865 --> 22:16.803
l could still win a Nobel Prize.

22:16.971 --> 22:22.813
Although the last two papers
l've written were widely discredited.

22:24.653 --> 22:29.686
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

22:29.997 --> 22:31.431
And sexy.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.663
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

22:35.107 --> 22:37.009
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

22:37.178 --> 22:39.706
-Thanks. l'm gonna go find her.
-Good for you.

22:39.883 --> 22:44.791
And your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.021
Stop going through my stuff!

22:51.507 --> 22:54.342
l just wanted to let you know
l've changed my mind.

22:54.513 --> 22:56.540
l'm gonna do it.
l'm gonna kiss Joey.

22:56.717 --> 23:00.212
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

23:00.390 --> 23:02.360
Please! What about you and Chandler?

23:02.529 --> 23:05.501
That's different. l was drunk and stupid.

23:05.668 --> 23:08.036
Well, hello?

23:09.208 --> 23:12.408
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

23:12.582 --> 23:15.144
-Why don't you just kiss one of them.
-l could...

23:15.320 --> 23:18.782
...but l don't want to.
l want to kiss Joey.

23:19.563 --> 23:23.560
All right. l think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

23:28.313 --> 23:29.805
l'm gonna do it.

23:29.983 --> 23:32.511
-And l can't stop you?
-No.

23:34.492 --> 23:36.622
Well, can l at least have
the phone numbers.

23:48.019 --> 23:51.253
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

23:57.037 --> 23:59.473
l'm smarter than him!

24:05.655 --> 24:08.525
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

24:08.694 --> 24:13.101
This was a really important experience
for me and l wanted to share it with you.

24:13.270 --> 24:15.035
You're so wonderful.
