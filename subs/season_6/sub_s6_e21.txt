WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:03.500
- Okay, Chandler.
- Okay.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.500
And your horoscope says:

00:05.705 --> 00:09.163
"On the 5th, a special
someone will give you a gift. "

00:09.376 --> 00:11.310
Well, thank you in advance.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.708
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat. "

00:14.914 --> 00:17.439
You're going to make fun
of my present.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.079
Why would you do that?

00:20.954 --> 00:25.653
Wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself. "

00:31.498 --> 00:32.624
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:32.832 --> 00:36.131
It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.033
That's right. It's your first day.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.471
Are you psyched to fight crime
with your robot sidekick?

00:43.676 --> 00:46.304
Am I?
The lead in my own TV series?

00:46.513 --> 00:49.107
I've dreamed about this for years!

00:49.282 --> 00:51.341
Why have I not been preparing?

00:52.685 --> 00:54.516
You're gonna be great.

00:54.821 --> 00:58.621
But I gotta act with a robot.
I know nothing about technology.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.692
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

01:03.163 --> 01:06.860
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

01:08.034 --> 01:10.935
Our spat will start early this month.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.468
I'll be waiting.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.236
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad

01:54.214 --> 01:58.674
Are you judging them by their covers?
You're really not supposed to.

01:59.519 --> 02:03.114
I'm deciding which one to use. I'm
going to write another book.

02:04.591 --> 02:07.253
Because the last one
was such a big seller?

02:07.894 --> 02:10.727
If you must know,
I have written 14 books.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.730
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

02:13.933 --> 02:17.391
I can tell you that
they have been well received.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.503
But I lost all of them in the fire.

02:21.674 --> 02:26.373
So this one I'm gonna keep in an
asbestos-lined box far away from Rachel.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.780
Who I forgive.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.417
What are you doing later?

02:34.621 --> 02:36.885
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.249
- We do?
- I wanna see what he wants.

02:41.561 --> 02:44.121
Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.421
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.726
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

02:52.472 --> 02:54.667
That's the only one you get.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.567
And he hates me.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.610
He asked Elizabeth why she'd want
to go out with a guy...

02:59.779 --> 03:01.770
who couldn't get a girl his own age.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.274
And what did she say to that?

03:06.286 --> 03:08.550
And that's yours.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.586
Come on. I really want
this guy to like me.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.818
It would really help if you guys
could make me look good.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.054
- Of course we'll help.
- Thanks.

03:18.631 --> 03:22.795
We know how tough those
parent-teacher conferences can be.

03:26.839 --> 03:30.104
- So here's your office set.
- Wow!

03:32.645 --> 03:35.546
Mac Machiavelli, private investigator.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.779
Look at all the books I've read.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.147
Let's get you to wardrobe.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.419
When do I meet the robot?

03:46.726 --> 03:49.354
Right now. He's right here.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.360
Joey Tribbiani, this is..

03:51.564 --> 03:54.499
Wow! He's so lifelike.

03:55.868 --> 03:56.892
Unbelievable.

03:57.103 --> 04:00.539
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.536
How do you do there, buddy?

04:03.276 --> 04:05.767
I'll let you two guys get acquainted.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.276
Sorry about that.

04:07.480 --> 04:11.644
- So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
- C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.388
Nice to meet you, Mac.

04:22.895 --> 04:26.558
- This is the temporary robot, right?
- No. Why?

04:27.066 --> 04:30.297
I thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.768
Like the Terminator,
or when I first saw you.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.467
I spent two years developing this.
It's state of the art.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.647
Sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.342
It can do this.

04:55.828 --> 04:59.696
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.024
It's great to meet you, Paul.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.832
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends
address me as Mr. Stevens.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.535
Of course. Mr. Stevens.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.335
So, Ross...

05:12.879 --> 05:14.369
what's your problem?

05:16.349 --> 05:17.475
Excuse me?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.876
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.284
It's funny...

05:24.223 --> 05:25.554
It's not funny.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.819
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.963
Okay, I can see that.

05:32.298 --> 05:36.735
I think if you give me one chance,
I can change your mind.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.334
- Okay.
- What?

05:40.206 --> 05:42.868
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.270
You've got one minute.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.979
- Daddy.
- Fine. Two minutes. Go.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.413
A minute and 50 seconds.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.823
I want you to know, I've
never done anything like this before.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.190
I mean, I've been in relationships
in general.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.562
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not...

06:11.471 --> 06:14.167
Not "it. " We haven't done "it. "

06:15.842 --> 06:17.901
I mean, we've done stuff...

06:20.079 --> 06:24.243
Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.008
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is Irish.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.316
- I'm Irish.
- And the Irish guy wins the joke.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.028
Ross! How crazy
that we would run into you.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.225
Oh, my God! Thank you.

06:40.032 --> 06:44.298
I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica and Chandler.

06:44.837 --> 06:45.895
- Phoebe.
- Hello.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.300
- Monica.
- Hi.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.997
Chunder.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.166
- Chandler.
- Never going to remember that.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.844
You're Elizabeth's dad?
I see where she gets her...

06:58.084 --> 06:59.779
rugged handsomeness.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.982
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

07:05.691 --> 07:07.181
There's a Mr. Bing!

07:09.495 --> 07:13.192
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed
away after she was born.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.092
I raised her by myself.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.469
I get that a lot.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.101
Why don't we all take a seat?

07:23.309 --> 07:26.676
I'll get us all some coffees.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.503
Yeah, why don't you...

07:29.882 --> 07:32.282
Talk about
whatever you want.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.318
Whatever pops into your head.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.954
It is strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

07:40.159 --> 07:42.889
because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.126
But not looking for dates.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.527
Monica is Ross's sister.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.463
He's a great brother!

07:54.674 --> 07:56.539
I had a sister.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.276
She passed away.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.045
You don't have to do that every time.

08:01.414 --> 08:05.544
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.048
Funny story...

08:08.554 --> 08:11.387
Your roommate in college died,
didn't he?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.851
A part of him did, yes.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.257
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

08:18.464 --> 08:21.092
I hope you guys are finding
something to talk about.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.234
- Yes. We were just..
- Sorry I'm late.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.599
But I am ready to talk you up.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.038
- When does Liz's father get here?
- I'm already here.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.445
Ross is so great!

08:37.950 --> 08:40.316
Hey, Phoebe.
How's the book writing going?

08:40.486 --> 08:43.046
Really well. I'm up to page 47.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.281
- Wow! What are you writing?
- Page numbers.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.950
Honey, you got the kind
with the little girl.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.292
You said you'd buy the kind
with the baby.

08:51.497 --> 08:54.557
- You said the baby creeps you out.
- The little girl does.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.299
- You said the baby.
- Why would a baby creep me out?

08:57.503 --> 09:00.233
Why would the little girl
creep you out?

09:00.406 --> 09:02.806
Can you please talk a little slower?

09:03.009 --> 09:05.341
- This is for your book?
- It's about relationships.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.070
The traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.442
Keep going. This stuff's great.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.811
Excuse me.

09:12.985 --> 09:17.422
And how none of it matters when
the people really love each other.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.995
And how people will believe anything
as long as it's a compliment.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.062
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

09:32.138 --> 09:36.131
- I left my keys here somewhere.
- Well, let's look for them.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.141
Hey, look! Are these them?

09:41.414 --> 09:43.245
No.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.213
All right.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.877
- Here they are.
- Good.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.919
- Thanks for your help.
- Wait! Sorry!

09:51.123 --> 09:53.023
- Mr. Paul?
- Just call me Paul.

09:53.225 --> 09:56.194
Paul.
I just wanted you to know that...

09:56.395 --> 09:58.590
Ross really is a great guy.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.992
Maybe you could date him. It'd
save me the trouble of killing him.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.462
Are you okay?

10:08.874 --> 10:11.672
You don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

10:11.877 --> 10:14.277
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.938
- We?
- It usually takes two people to...

10:18.651 --> 10:21.017
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!

10:21.220 --> 10:26.021
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.486
I'm just me.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.956
My wife died shortly after
Lizzie was born.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.526
So you raised her all on your own?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.028
Yes, I did.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.334
- What are you writing there?
- I'm drawing a picture of you.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.702
Well, that's very flattering.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.475
But it'd be great if you could draw me
with some clothes and a head.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.515
How was your first day?

10:56.722 --> 10:59.247
Pretty good. Except I got
attitude from the robot.

10:59.625 --> 11:03.186
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

11:04.363 --> 11:06.763
It was the guy who controls the robot.

11:06.966 --> 11:10.424
He hates me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
knock over the sandwich table...

11:10.636 --> 11:12.729
right when I was reaching for one.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.599
Why don't you get him fired?

11:14.807 --> 11:18.334
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

11:18.711 --> 11:23.307
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.408
Excuse me.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.682
Joey Tribbiani.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.415
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.687
But it's kind of on the q. t.

11:35.895 --> 11:39.592
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.824
It's the lead in a series.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.558
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.230
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.312
Joey?

11:56.082 --> 11:57.174
Hi, Ross.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.850
I was just getting him to like you.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.086
Joey!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.426
Ross, Joey is not here.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.724
I'll just wait for him in here!

12:16.068 --> 12:18.628
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.732
Yeah. It's okay. It's me...

12:21.574 --> 12:23.337
Mr. Stevens.

12:24.510 --> 12:28.207
I didn't... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

12:28.914 --> 12:32.008
You did. You came in, got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.913
You were shouting, "Joey!"

12:36.589 --> 12:37.954
- Bye, Rachel.
- Bye.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.146
I'll call you later.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.915
- See you.
- Bye, Ross.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.590
What? What the..? How did...? What?

12:48.868 --> 12:53.271
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

12:53.472 --> 12:54.962
In your mouth?

12:57.042 --> 12:58.475
No!

12:58.644 --> 13:00.703
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

13:00.913 --> 13:04.906
for two hours. I liked him.
I invited him for coffee.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.947
You were at the coffeehouse!

13:09.355 --> 13:12.188
What's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.951
He is my girlfriend's father.
It's weird!

13:16.796 --> 13:19.629
- You dated my sister!
- That was different!

13:20.132 --> 13:23.795
- What? Why?
- This is weird for me!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.768
Ross, look. This is good for you.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.332
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.

13:31.510 --> 13:35.002
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

13:35.181 --> 13:39.515
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

13:39.885 --> 13:43.321
Plus the guy
is a very successful lawyer.

13:43.622 --> 13:47.558
- How is that important?
- It's important!

13:49.328 --> 13:52.092
There's a million guys
who can play Mac...

13:52.298 --> 13:53.560
and there's one robot.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.429
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

13:57.636 --> 14:01.663
- What am I gonna do?
- You're a pretty charming guy.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.533
Thanks. But I have a problem
to deal with.

14:04.877 --> 14:08.176
No, you've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.146
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

14:13.152 --> 14:14.744
That's not a bad idea!

14:15.487 --> 14:20.117
If I have to be charming tomorrow,
I'm not wasting it on you guys.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.692
I got some saved for you, Phoebe.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.298
Do you think Joey is
more charming than me?

14:29.802 --> 14:32.032
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.031
You wish.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.500
"You wish. "

14:39.912 --> 14:41.106
Stop writing about us.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.612
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.818
- Who?
- Marsha and Chester.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.981
Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.594
- "Phyllis is sitting in the chair. "
- I see what you're doing.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.432
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing. "

15:03.068 --> 15:06.970
I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter!

15:13.045 --> 15:14.239
Morning!

15:14.813 --> 15:17.338
How's my favorite genius
and his robot?

15:17.549 --> 15:19.676
- Don't touch him!
- Okay.

15:21.654 --> 15:25.886
Level with me. I keep hearing
rumors that I might get fired.

15:26.191 --> 15:29.217
They even have actors reading
for my part.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.153
Come on. You gotta give me
a second chance.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.025
I love this little guy.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.030
That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right?

15:42.441 --> 15:45.001
I can't believe it. God!

15:46.345 --> 15:48.870
Hey, how are you doing?

15:53.719 --> 15:57.086
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

15:57.456 --> 16:01.950
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.322
What a nice story.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.157
So Ross was in college...

16:06.332 --> 16:10.996
and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.333
I definitely did not see
that one backfiring.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.267
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Take your time.

16:22.481 --> 16:26.781
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as..

16:27.152 --> 16:29.985
Look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

16:31.123 --> 16:34.388
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

16:34.994 --> 16:40.057
and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

16:41.233 --> 16:45.169
I admit after all the
wonderful things Lizzie told me...

16:45.371 --> 16:50.604
and the many, many, many stories
that Rachel has told me...

16:51.477 --> 16:52.637
well...

16:54.113 --> 16:55.774
you're not...

16:56.615 --> 16:58.742
all bad.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.479
"Not all bad. "

17:02.454 --> 17:05.685
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.816
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

17:10.329 --> 17:14.026
I know what you mean. I do that too.

17:15.501 --> 17:20.165
- I beg your pardon?
- I don't see her as a 12-year-old.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.899
I mean, I have a son who is 6
and I still think of him as a baby.

17:25.110 --> 17:29.877
- A son?
- My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.382
Incidentally, Carol and I
are on excellent terms...

17:33.585 --> 17:35.780
as I'm sure you are with your wife.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.080
I'm sorry.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.024
It's unbelievable!

17:40.859 --> 17:43.555
Don't worry. I didn't realize
you were married.

17:44.096 --> 17:47.463
We were. But that was just a...

17:50.169 --> 17:53.661
That was just a big drunken mistake.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.536
You're back.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.403
You two were married?

18:02.347 --> 18:05.908
I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.418
We said we would meet
at the coffeehouse at 6:00.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.648
We said 7:00.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.390
We said 6:00!

18:14.660 --> 18:16.457
The only way that I said 6:00...

18:16.662 --> 18:21.429
would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

18:22.167 --> 18:24.863
If I had said 7:00, I would have said:

18:25.070 --> 18:28.699
"My boyfriend is such a
wiseass. 7:00!"

18:29.842 --> 18:31.901
- Hi!
- Oh, my good God!

18:32.678 --> 18:34.771
- I know what time you said.
- What?

18:35.214 --> 18:38.615
Well, I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.576
What time?

18:41.753 --> 18:42.811
Interesting turn of events.

18:43.021 --> 18:46.457
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.058
Very interesting.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.223
Well this certainly clears things up.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.057
What does it say?

18:54.500 --> 18:58.527
I will tell you as soon as you thank
me for writing my book.

18:59.071 --> 19:02.529
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

19:02.708 --> 19:05.370
and you are the
queen of everything.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.676
Thanks. So are you.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.983
I told you I should
not wear this color.

19:20.726 --> 19:26.255
"Monica.. Marsha and Chester are
planning on seeing a movie Sunday.

19:27.065 --> 19:31.434
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at
6:00. Chester thinks it's 7:00."

19:32.171 --> 19:35.197
- You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
- Right.

19:35.641 --> 19:40.101
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

19:40.279 --> 19:42.804
"Marsha and Chester
are mad at Phyllis. "

19:48.587 --> 19:50.680
I can't believe
I'm gonna lose this job.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.457
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

19:53.992 --> 19:58.122
Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.028
Joey, I want to talk to you.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.704
I don't want to talk to you.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.501
I hate you. You ruined my life.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.702
- Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
- Hi.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.939
I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.246
Why should I help you out?

20:19.418 --> 20:23.548
- The reason he just said.
- What do you need?

20:24.556 --> 20:28.083
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

20:28.293 --> 20:31.660
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.055
- Are you in love with her?
- Yeah.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.160
Her. All of them. Anyone.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.332
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.200
Listen, I guarantee you
keep your job...

20:43.375 --> 20:46.503
if you can teach me to talk
to women like you do.

20:48.046 --> 20:51.641
You can't teach it.
It's something you're born with.

20:51.850 --> 20:55.081
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.449
- Really?
- Sure. Yeah. I taught him.

20:57.623 --> 21:01.320
Yeah. You should see the woman I'm with,
way out of my league.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.825
In fact, if you want, I can get you her.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.690
Well, if you think about it...

21:09.868 --> 21:12.928
Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.437
How to make the next one even shorter?

21:15.641 --> 21:17.302
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

21:17.509 --> 21:20.603
He was married to me a hell of a lot
longer than he was to Emily.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.679
He just didn't tell me.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.649
Maybe I have to pee again.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.125
Well, this is fun.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.492
So, Ross, did you kill any
of these wives?

21:41.900 --> 21:46.428
I have had enough of this! I
care a great deal about your daughter.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.038
And I have treated her with respect!

21:49.241 --> 21:51.471
So if you've got a problem with me..

21:51.777 --> 21:54.575
- Are you yelling at me?
- God, no.

21:56.214 --> 21:59.547
You know what?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.

22:00.018 --> 22:03.181
It doesn't matter.
I'm going out with him anyway.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.356
Really?

22:05.524 --> 22:07.924
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

22:08.093 --> 22:12.052
it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.163
What can I say?

22:19.738 --> 22:21.467
I still don't like you.

22:21.673 --> 22:25.404
I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.772
- Then we agree?
- I guess so.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.047
- Neither of us like Ross.
- I like Ross.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.548
Kids!

22:34.920 --> 22:38.185
I just thought of a story
about how nice Ross is.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.955
That's okay.
We're not liking Ross right now.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.793
Well, I got a lot of those too.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.857
You were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.

22:50.235 --> 22:53.762
- The shipment never made it to Omaha?
- You got it.

22:53.972 --> 22:57.237
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horsehair.

22:57.442 --> 23:00.707
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.941
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.481
Wayne! Wayne!
