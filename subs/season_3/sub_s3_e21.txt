WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:06.036
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

00:06.214 --> 00:09.274
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

00:09.517 --> 00:12.452
- Oh, my God! They took my idea!
- That was you?

00:13.555 --> 00:14.920
Okay, there you go.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.388
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

00:17.592 --> 00:19.082
Oh, that's so...

00:20.862 --> 00:23.262
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

00:26.734 --> 00:28.065
Oh, my.

00:31.806 --> 00:32.795
The One With a Chick and a Duck

01:19.621 --> 01:21.452
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.252
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

01:26.694 --> 01:29.822
So that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

01:31.566 --> 01:33.625
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

01:34.869 --> 01:36.598
You should come out with Ross and me.

01:36.771 --> 01:39.672
Anything is better than sitting
here crying all day about Kate.

01:40.308 --> 01:45.143
I was crying because
nobody believed Quincy's theory.

01:47.048 --> 01:48.743
I'm gonna be on TV!

01:48.917 --> 01:50.145
- No way!
- Yeah.

01:50.518 --> 01:54.147
They're putting together a panel
to talk about these fossils in Peru.

01:54.355 --> 01:55.947
The Discovery Channel's filming it!

01:56.190 --> 01:59.887
Oh, my God!
Who's gonna watch that?

02:01.396 --> 02:03.023
- Thanks. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

02:03.531 --> 02:05.294
I saw a girl with that vest.

02:05.566 --> 02:06.590
Thanks.

02:09.137 --> 02:13.267
Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

02:13.474 --> 02:16.568
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

02:17.745 --> 02:22.876
Unfortunately, most of these little guys
won't live to see the 4th of July...

02:23.084 --> 02:26.383
...because, as a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

02:26.921 --> 02:28.718
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

02:28.923 --> 02:34.452
I was watching this commercial on TV,
and, man, those things are cute!

02:36.798 --> 02:37.787
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:37.966 --> 02:41.424
Pete, you're back!
Hey, check this out!

02:41.736 --> 02:43.761
Skates!

02:47.241 --> 02:51.007
You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

02:51.312 --> 02:52.336
So how was your trip?

02:53.181 --> 02:55.172
What'd you bring me?

02:56.517 --> 02:59.816
Hotel toiletries from Japan!

03:00.154 --> 03:02.714
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

03:02.890 --> 03:05.324
You know what that says in English?
Made in Texas.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.288
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

03:13.101 --> 03:14.398
Regular or decaf?

03:15.269 --> 03:16.827
Whichever's closest.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.273
- So ask me what I did today.
- So, what did you do today, Pete?

03:21.476 --> 03:24.001
I bought a restaurant, and I'd
like you to be the chef.

03:24.178 --> 03:26.009
What?

03:30.885 --> 03:33.080
Can you believe he
offered me a restaurant?

03:33.287 --> 03:36.381
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

03:37.091 --> 03:39.958
This has been my dream since
I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

03:40.261 --> 03:42.855
...and opened Easy Monica's Bakery.

03:49.871 --> 03:53.102
I would kill for this job.
I can totally do this job...

03:53.374 --> 03:57.071
...and God knows, I've paid my dues.

03:58.479 --> 04:01.243
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

04:01.416 --> 04:03.350
You're still not attracted to him at all?

04:03.518 --> 04:08.285
No. I mean, how could I accept
a restaurant from him? I can't.

04:08.556 --> 04:11.684
I couldn't accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the 7th grade.

04:11.893 --> 04:15.989
But, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

04:17.265 --> 04:18.391
What, honey?

04:18.566 --> 04:21.763
My side still hurts from when
you crashed into me yesterday.

04:21.936 --> 04:23.563
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.067
Oh, God!

04:25.973 --> 04:27.634
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.072
Got a job on a riverboat?

04:36.150 --> 04:39.449
You know what? I didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.679
You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

04:41.889 --> 04:44.153
I see. So this suit is making a point.

04:44.425 --> 04:48.657
Now that you're on your own, you're
free to look as stupid as you'd like.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.388
You like it, right?

04:50.565 --> 04:54.023
Absolutely! I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

04:54.936 --> 04:56.631
Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.

04:56.804 --> 04:58.499
- What were you gonna tell us?
- Yeah.

04:58.706 --> 05:02.369
- Was it how you invented the cotton gin?
- Okay, goodbye.

05:04.412 --> 05:06.676
- Was that a little harsh?
- Are you kidding?

05:06.848 --> 05:09.248
Remember when you used to wear
that gray sweat suit.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.214
And I used to call you the Hindenberg.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.915
No.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.381
My mistake.

05:18.326 --> 05:20.988
So after you put the suggestion
in the box...

05:21.162 --> 05:24.256
...how long did it take
for the roller skating to happen?

05:24.432 --> 05:25.421
About three months.

05:25.666 --> 05:30.126
Okay, so I guess that's about two
weeks before the topless thing kicks in.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.941
I got you something.
Open it! Open it!

05:40.448 --> 05:42.541
Okay.

05:46.454 --> 05:48.115
It's a chicken.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.687
It's cute, huh?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.224
You guys, do you know
anything about chicks?

05:53.528 --> 05:55.689
Fowl? No.

05:56.030 --> 05:58.328
Women? No.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.731
They are a huge responsibility.

06:01.936 --> 06:04.769
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

06:05.006 --> 06:08.169
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.934
Well, no problem there.

06:16.450 --> 06:17.508
Easy, Lenny.

06:22.523 --> 06:25.253
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

06:25.593 --> 06:26.855
Okay, here's the thing.

06:27.161 --> 06:29.959
Oh, no. Not "the thing."
I hate "the thing."

06:30.198 --> 06:31.426
What's "the thing"?

06:32.967 --> 06:33.956
I can't do it.

06:34.535 --> 06:36.503
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

06:36.671 --> 06:39.435
...but you have these feelings for me.

06:39.707 --> 06:41.834
Wait. That's what you're worried about?

06:42.109 --> 06:45.010
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

06:45.179 --> 06:49.673
I was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but I met somebody else on my trip.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.220
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
We met on the plane.

06:54.388 --> 06:55.753
She asked to finish my peanuts.

06:55.923 --> 06:59.051
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

07:01.829 --> 07:04.161
Yeah, I just...
I mean, I got tired of waiting.

07:04.332 --> 07:09.565
That's great. I'm sorry,
but I'm so happy for you.

07:09.904 --> 07:12.031
- And now I can work for you!
- I guess you can.

07:12.306 --> 07:16.208
Oh, my God! This is incredible!

07:17.078 --> 07:20.639
You know what? I'm gonna roll
right into that office and quit!

07:20.915 --> 07:22.473
All right!

07:22.984 --> 07:25.714
- Could you give me a little push?
- Yeah, sure.

07:25.886 --> 07:28.013
- Good luck!
- I'm quitting!

07:32.260 --> 07:34.592
I'm okay! I'm all right!

07:37.865 --> 07:41.596
That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

07:42.303 --> 07:43.497
What?

07:43.738 --> 07:47.572
I'm just saying, this woman,
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

07:48.442 --> 07:50.774
- Why would you say that?
- You're still into Monica.

07:50.945 --> 07:53.937
You said there's somebody else,
so she'd agree to work with you.

07:54.215 --> 07:57.412
If you spend a lot of time together,
maybe something might happen.

07:58.886 --> 08:00.786
You're good. You're good.

08:01.656 --> 08:04.716
No, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic.

08:05.126 --> 08:07.117
It's a substantial gift.

08:08.462 --> 08:11.124
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her though?

08:11.399 --> 08:15.028
Absolutely. I promise.
Tell her what?

08:15.970 --> 08:17.232
Thanks a lot.

08:17.505 --> 08:20.269
No, I'm serious.
I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

08:22.576 --> 08:24.635
Okay, but this is the last time.

08:25.313 --> 08:28.248
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

08:28.416 --> 08:31.112
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

08:31.285 --> 08:33.378
Chicken

08:34.889 --> 08:36.447
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:36.624 --> 08:38.182
How's she doing?

08:38.592 --> 08:39.616
She?

08:40.261 --> 08:41.956
Yeah, don't you think it's a she?

08:42.797 --> 08:44.162
I don't know.

08:54.275 --> 08:56.937
I can't tell. Whatever it was
went back in too quickly.

08:58.479 --> 09:01.642
Anyway, I gotta go change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

09:01.816 --> 09:03.010
Excuse me?

09:03.284 --> 09:04.273
What?

09:04.719 --> 09:06.846
I stayed home while
you were at rehearsal...

09:07.121 --> 09:09.612
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

09:09.957 --> 09:13.893
Who was up from 2:00 this
morning until 5:00 this morning...

09:14.161 --> 09:16.152
...trying to get her back to sleep?

09:16.731 --> 09:18.722
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

09:19.867 --> 09:21.129
Oh, here it comes.

09:21.335 --> 09:24.896
Yes! Here it comes!
I'm stuck here all day!

09:25.206 --> 09:28.198
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us.

09:30.010 --> 09:33.377
And then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

09:33.581 --> 09:35.572
Well, I don't think so, mister!

09:36.684 --> 09:39.778
I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

09:40.588 --> 09:43.682
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

09:46.427 --> 09:48.918
That's not what I said.
I just meant...

09:49.163 --> 09:51.757
I know what you meant!

09:57.872 --> 10:00.705
Have you noticed that ever since
we got this chick...

10:01.208 --> 10:04.041
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

10:06.147 --> 10:09.048
I don't know. Maybe we weren't
ready to have a chick.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.448
I sure want one someday though.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.780
I know. I know.

10:16.424 --> 10:18.892
I'll take her back tomorrow.

10:19.059 --> 10:21.857
You think we'll get our $3 back?

10:22.663 --> 10:24.961
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.802
- I can't believe you still have that.
- We're taking her back.

10:28.969 --> 10:31.836
No, that ridiculous thing on your face.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.735
- Thank you.
- All right?

10:33.908 --> 10:37.105
I have that TV thing in, like, two hours,
and I need your help, okay?

10:37.344 --> 10:41.405
What do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

10:41.582 --> 10:43.447
The brown one brings out your eyes.

10:43.651 --> 10:45.846
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

10:47.955 --> 10:49.183
Really?

11:03.504 --> 11:06.268
That aspirin dance really works.

11:09.243 --> 11:11.677
- Oh, my God. Is that still?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:11.912 --> 11:13.777
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.744
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.385
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

11:21.622 --> 11:24.557
I have got to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.023
There's a lot of people there
that I have to meet.

11:27.194 --> 11:30.322
I'm sure you'll make a great
impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel Greene.

11:30.498 --> 11:32.932
It's nice to meet you."

11:33.634 --> 11:35.465
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

11:35.636 --> 11:39.037
I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.731
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.672
Look, either help me or go.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.576
Fine. I'll go.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.379
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

11:53.287 --> 11:55.380
Sure. I'll help you.

11:56.290 --> 11:59.851
Good! Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

12:10.271 --> 12:14.731
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.410
Would you please help me
with this too?

12:24.618 --> 12:27.416
- Okay, let's use this brush.
- Okay.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.779
- This stuff?
- Careful.

12:29.957 --> 12:30.981
- Okay.
- Light.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.592
Just sweep it across the lid.
Just sweep it.

12:36.263 --> 12:37.491
Sorry!

12:38.165 --> 12:39.757
That's just poking me in the eye.

12:39.934 --> 12:41.162
I'm sorry. Close.

12:41.435 --> 12:43.403
- Just sweep it.
- I'm sweeping.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.669
Sweep, sweep.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.199
Okay, now make it even
because we don't...

12:48.375 --> 12:49.364
What?

12:49.543 --> 12:52.569
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

12:52.746 --> 12:54.680
You don't wear enough of this.

12:59.019 --> 13:02.853
Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

13:03.123 --> 13:05.751
Close your eye.
You're gonna like this better.

13:07.494 --> 13:09.394
- Close, close.
- Blow it.

13:09.563 --> 13:14.262
Sorry. Because I think this will make
you a little more sophisticated.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.826
Sophisticated like a hooker?

13:19.239 --> 13:20.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:21.075 --> 13:22.838
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

13:23.043 --> 13:24.977
I'm checking out
the restaurant with Pete.

13:25.212 --> 13:27.646
Monica, I am so excited for you!

13:28.983 --> 13:30.348
I have to tell you something.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.175
- What?
- I can't tell you.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.450
Wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell
me something that you could tell me?

13:38.659 --> 13:40.650
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

13:42.496 --> 13:46.330
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to all my gods.

13:49.403 --> 13:51.200
Does it have to do with
Ross and Rachel?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.839
No.

13:53.007 --> 13:54.998
- Does it have to do with Joey?
- No.

13:55.175 --> 13:58.667
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock he keeps by his bed?

14:00.981 --> 14:02.846
No, but let's come back to that later.

14:07.021 --> 14:10.513
There you go!
Good enough for your party?

14:16.563 --> 14:17.825
Sure.

14:18.565 --> 14:24.731
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from purchasing.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.601
Come on!
Okay, come on.

14:27.775 --> 14:30.835
All right, I gotta go,
so good luck at the party, okay?

14:31.045 --> 14:33.946
Oh, wait. Ross, could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

14:36.417 --> 14:37.782
Sure. Okay.

14:38.519 --> 14:42.011
Okay, great. Okay, just turn around.

14:42.456 --> 14:43.445
What?

14:43.691 --> 14:45.215
I don't want you to see me naked.

14:45.392 --> 14:49.795
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million
times. I ate hot fudge off you naked.

14:50.030 --> 14:53.158
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

14:54.535 --> 14:57.163
Yeah, but that was different.
We were going out then.

14:57.404 --> 14:59.133
Now it's weird.

14:59.373 --> 15:02.865
Rach, you know, I can see
you naked anytime I want.

15:03.544 --> 15:05.102
What?

15:05.379 --> 15:09.247
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See?

15:12.820 --> 15:15.948
- Ross, stop that!
- I'm sorry.

15:16.123 --> 15:19.058
Come on! I don't want you thinking
of me like that anymore.

15:19.259 --> 15:20.988
Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

15:21.228 --> 15:23.753
It's one of my rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

15:26.934 --> 15:30.267
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

15:30.537 --> 15:32.664
I'm sorry. It will never happen...

15:32.906 --> 15:34.339
Wait a minute! Wait, wait.

15:34.641 --> 15:37.906
Now there are 100 of you,
and I'm the king!

15:39.480 --> 15:42.972
- Ross.
- Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

15:44.518 --> 15:47.146
All right. Fine.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.518
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

15:56.029 --> 15:59.430
Oh, my God. All right, look, look.
Okay. Rach!

15:59.600 --> 16:02.831
Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

16:03.003 --> 16:04.868
- Okay, I do. I really do.
- Okay?

16:05.072 --> 16:07.597
I'm gonna get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.604
Wait! You're not gonna come with me?

16:13.213 --> 16:15.443
Of course I am.

16:15.649 --> 16:17.549
I just have to make a call.

16:17.718 --> 16:18.707
- Okay
- Okay.

16:18.886 --> 16:19.944
Thank you.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.050
What's wrong?

16:27.327 --> 16:30.888
I'm sorry. I just can't go
to the hospital looking like this.

16:32.232 --> 16:34.325
- Does it involve travel?
- No.

16:34.601 --> 16:36.762
Does it involve clogs?

16:37.037 --> 16:39.505
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

16:39.940 --> 16:41.464
- Clogs.
- No.

16:41.675 --> 16:43.165
- Claws?
- No.

16:45.946 --> 16:49.814
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross
or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.

16:50.350 --> 16:52.409
- What about Pete?
- No.

16:52.586 --> 16:54.247
What is it?

16:55.088 --> 16:57.750
- What about Pete?
- I don't know!

16:58.392 --> 17:00.758
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

17:02.863 --> 17:06.424
- Phoebe, would you just tell me?
- I can't!

17:06.700 --> 17:09.533
- Okay, I gotta go.
- But you're so close! No!

17:09.736 --> 17:11.704
Does it involve
Pete's computer company?

17:11.939 --> 17:14.908
Just go! You're never gonna get it!

17:23.150 --> 17:24.412
I know.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.280
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

17:28.555 --> 17:31.285
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

17:35.295 --> 17:37.229
I love you both.

17:38.332 --> 17:40.926
But in very different ways.

17:41.668 --> 17:44.034
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:46.006 --> 17:48.998
What are you doing? I thought
you were gonna take her back today.

17:49.176 --> 17:51.167
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

17:51.345 --> 17:55.042
So then I took her to the shelter,
and you know what I found out?

18:00.420 --> 18:04.117
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her!

18:04.291 --> 18:06.589
I'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

18:09.029 --> 18:12.829
Okay, good, good, good, because I was
kind of having second thoughts too.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.959
Okay, and it's not just chicks.
It's all kinds of other animals.

18:17.204 --> 18:19.729
That's horrible.
You did the right thing, man.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.965
Thanks. I'm glad
you see it that way.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.012
Funny story!

18:38.759 --> 18:40.818
I don't believe this!

18:41.061 --> 18:44.360
Look at this refrigerator!
It's gigantic!

18:44.531 --> 18:48.331
I mean, I could live in this thing!
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

18:50.037 --> 18:53.529
Oh, my God! Look at these spider
burners! I love spider burners!

18:53.707 --> 18:55.197
So you like it?

18:55.442 --> 18:59.208
It is so perfect!
Thank you so much.

18:59.413 --> 19:00.903
You're welcome.

19:07.587 --> 19:09.020
Did you just smell my hair?

19:10.257 --> 19:12.589
No! No way! What? No.

19:13.393 --> 19:15.190
- Oh, God.
- What?

19:16.830 --> 19:18.730
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

19:19.032 --> 19:22.832
No, I'm just excited about
the restaurant, that's all.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.194
- Pete.
- Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

19:27.374 --> 19:29.604
No, it's not bad.
It's not bad at all.

19:29.843 --> 19:31.674
It's really nice.

19:32.179 --> 19:35.910
The only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.711
You may be okay with getting hurt...

19:38.885 --> 19:42.116
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

19:44.024 --> 19:45.753
That's why I can't take this job.

19:46.026 --> 19:47.186
What?

19:48.462 --> 19:51.260
We probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.597
I'm sorry.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.031
Okay, yeah.

19:56.236 --> 20:00.229
I mean, if that's
really what you want, okay.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.067
Okay, bye.

20:10.650 --> 20:14.017
- I'm sorry things didn't work out...
- Shut up for a second...

20:14.187 --> 20:16.883
...and let me just see something.

20:30.170 --> 20:31.603
You'd tell me the truth, right?

20:31.905 --> 20:35.966
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

20:36.643 --> 20:41.774
Okay, now you stay out here,
and you think about what you did!

20:43.517 --> 20:46.008
- That's a duck!
- That's a bad duck!

20:48.955 --> 20:51.355
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

20:52.793 --> 20:53.851
What thing? What thing?

20:54.027 --> 20:56.757
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

20:57.664 --> 20:58.756
Easy.

21:00.467 --> 21:04.927
Now, when you come back, I hope you
remember that that chick is not a toy!

21:09.176 --> 21:11.007
What thing? What is this thing?

21:11.278 --> 21:15.578
I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.014
Oh, my God!

21:18.285 --> 21:20.014
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

21:20.287 --> 21:22.983
Because I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

21:23.223 --> 21:27.284
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.527
- I cannot believe you.
- What?

21:30.730 --> 21:33.699
That is the sweetest thing.

21:44.044 --> 21:45.511
You should get some sleep.

21:47.914 --> 21:50.212
- So I'll...
- Sorry I spoiled your evening.

21:50.383 --> 21:52.681
No, that's...
No, as long as you're okay.

21:52.886 --> 21:55.980
So I'll see you tomorrow.

21:56.156 --> 21:58.590
Yeah.

22:05.065 --> 22:06.362
See you.

22:19.045 --> 22:20.376
What did you do?

22:31.124 --> 22:32.216
What you doing?

22:32.425 --> 22:34.256
Having a swim.

22:34.794 --> 22:36.785
What about the chick?

22:37.197 --> 22:38.687
Chicks don't swim.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.389
Are you sure?

22:42.269 --> 22:43.896
I don't know.

22:45.272 --> 22:47.206
- Should we try?
- Sure.

22:54.447 --> 22:57.644
See, I told you.
They don't swim.

22:58.385 --> 23:01.183
- Wait, give him a minute.
- No!

23:02.322 --> 23:04.756
It's okay.
It's okay, baby, baby, baby.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.417
