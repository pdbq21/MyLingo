WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:03.630
-Oh! Hey, Rach!
-Hi.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.635
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!

00:06.807 --> 00:08.399
How's living at Ross'?

00:08.609 --> 00:14.241
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

00:14.448 --> 00:19.909
Something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.588
Oh, thank you.
I'll see you guys later.

00:27.094 --> 00:30.655
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

00:32.733 --> 00:36.430
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.

00:36.670 --> 00:41.334
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.373
Thanks. Maybe later.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.943
-Gunther, can I get a scone?
-Want anything?

00:48.181 --> 00:50.308
I want a lot of things.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.280
I wanna be with the woman I love
on Valentine's Day.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.451
I want her to love me back.

00:55.689 --> 01:01.389
And I want relief from the wrenching
pain of knowing that won't happen!

01:02.496 --> 01:04.088
We have red bagels.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.297
Okay.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.737
So how do you guys
like living together so far?

01:49.910 --> 01:51.605
-Oh, it's been good.
-Yeah.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.246
Except Ross is more uptight
about crumbs than you are.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.008
There was a drumstick in the couch.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.750
And I am not uptight about crumbs.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.388
It's just that, you know..

02:02.556 --> 02:05.491
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.593
And that's how the plague started.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.389
So you wanna relive that again..

02:10.831 --> 02:12.628
Mice didn't start the plague.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.027
Rats did.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.499
Rattus norvegicus, to be exact.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.631
Oh, good God, Ross.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.269
Nick at Nite, once in a while.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.109
All right, I'm going.
Bye.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.508
Phoebe, will you wait here?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.775
-I wanna get your opinion on something.
-Yeah.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.312
How does Mona feel about
Rachel moving in?

02:34.554 --> 02:36.647
I'm on my way to tell her.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.883
She's been away all week,
but she'll be cool.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.789
She's been so supportive.

02:41.962 --> 02:46.490
She even got the baby a T-shirt
that says "Fossils are my friends."

02:48.268 --> 02:50.828
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.001
So I'm gonna take off.

02:53.273 --> 02:57.334
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Rachel wanted to see this tape.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.307
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.209
Could you take it to your apartment?

03:03.483 --> 03:06.384
"Candy and Cookie"?

03:06.653 --> 03:09.247
Candy's the mom,
Cookie's the daughter.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.789
The father's name is also Cookie.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.594
Why am I friends with these people?

03:17.230 --> 03:18.527
Phoebe, come here.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.792
I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.593
Monica, grow up.

03:24.237 --> 03:30.437
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.477
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.478
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.480
Okay, big brother.

03:38.685 --> 03:44.089
Which one would make your best friend
want to do your little sister?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.424
The red one.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.132
Hey.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.809
I know you're depressed,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.639
Right outside is a real,
live, furry playmate.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.011
I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.951
Hey, a dog!

04:18.191 --> 04:21.627
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

04:22.062 --> 04:26.658
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.925
So you can keep him
till he cheers you up.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.501
I borrow him myself
from time to time..

04:32.672 --> 04:34.537
when I get depressed
thinking about..

04:34.708 --> 04:36.232
world hunger, poverty..

04:36.409 --> 04:39.207
Not to trivialize your pain.

04:39.379 --> 04:43.611
Thanks so much, Pheebs.
We are gonna have so much fun!

04:43.817 --> 04:45.785
Oh, not that kind of fun.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.391
Happy Valentine's!

04:55.762 --> 05:01.997
I'm slipping into something a bit less
comfortable and a bit more slutty.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.268
"Candy and Cookie"?

05:10.577 --> 05:13.011
"Candy and Cookie"?!

05:13.246 --> 05:15.612
Monica got me porn?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.952
Girl-on-girl porn?!

05:20.854 --> 05:23.288
She really must love me!

05:33.466 --> 05:37.493
-Yeah, just relax.
-I love you, St. Valentine.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.978
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.680
Now push!

05:52.185 --> 05:54.312
Oh, God, it hurts!

05:54.521 --> 05:57.888
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

05:58.358 --> 06:02.260
-Oh, make it stop!
-I am trying!

06:04.531 --> 06:06.863
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

06:07.334 --> 06:10.030
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.399
Did I just throw this?

06:18.278 --> 06:19.336
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.913
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.346
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.920
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.

06:31.191 --> 06:36.219
You are so cute. I wish I could play,
but I've gotta go to work.

06:36.429 --> 06:40.866
I hope I stop talking like this
before my meeting. Yes, I do.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.795
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.675
Come here! Hey!

06:51.111 --> 06:54.376
That's Rachel. She used to live here.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.540
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.412
But we can't have her.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.315
I really miss her.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.590
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.629
Well, you used to be.

07:21.741 --> 07:24.141
So, what do you think?

07:26.413 --> 07:28.074
I've still got it.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.846
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?

07:32.052 --> 07:36.887
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.490
Oh, the dilating!

07:41.628 --> 07:46.588
Is this the video of the birth? It's
Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?

07:51.137 --> 07:55.301
I thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

07:56.509 --> 08:01.071
If you thought I was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day..

08:01.281 --> 08:03.249
you were right.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.617
It's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom..

08:08.788 --> 08:12.155
but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.825
It got four stars.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.460
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.928
-Anyway, you wanna take a look?
-Well..

08:21.101 --> 08:26.334
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
-Hey, what's going on?

08:26.539 --> 08:29.474
Remember the first time
you saw Jaws..

08:29.709 --> 08:33.702
how long it took
to go back in the water?

08:35.548 --> 08:38.676
We can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.675
You gotta get past it.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.151
Just get back on the horse.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.258
Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the
bedroom and change into her sweatpants.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.696
-Okay, you don't know. You didn't see it.
-Childbirth is beautiful.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.424
Oh, beautiful? Really?

08:55.635 --> 08:58.103
You think this is beautiful?

09:01.908 --> 09:05.742
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

09:07.714 --> 09:10.512
-See, honey, there's..
-Don't touch me!

09:12.952 --> 09:15.614
-Hi!
-Hey!

09:16.656 --> 09:18.851
-How was Atlantic City?
-Good.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.616
I brought you back a present.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.658
You didn't have to..

09:23.930 --> 09:26.160
Saltwater taffy?!

09:27.067 --> 09:28.932
Thanks.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.036
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.470
It's actually made
with salted fresh water.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.476
That's not interesting.

09:39.679 --> 09:43.137
-I think it's interesting.
-Me too. I missed you!

09:43.316 --> 09:44.305
Me too.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.349
-How was your week?
-Good.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.951
-The baby started kicking.
-How exciting!

09:50.123 --> 09:54.992
It was amazing. The only thing is,
I wasn't there the first time.

09:55.195 --> 09:59.291
-Oh, no.
-I was missing out on all this stuff.

09:59.499 --> 10:04.562
-Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
-Yeah, right.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.436
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.

10:08.675 --> 10:12.702
"Have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward."

10:17.650 --> 10:20.016
Imagine, I go away for a few days..

10:20.186 --> 10:24.088
and my boyfriend is living
with a woman he got pregnant.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.321
So, what'd you tell him?

10:40.773 --> 10:43.469
You didn't tell Mona
Rachel moved in?

10:43.743 --> 10:47.304
She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

10:47.580 --> 10:51.607
Plus, she got me taffy.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.651
-Really? I've never had any.
-Ever?

10:54.854 --> 10:59.757
My mom was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.992
Thank you.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.759
Are you gonna tell her?

11:04.964 --> 11:07.660
I will. I want to butter her up first.

11:07.934 --> 11:12.371
I'm gonna take her to dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.802
When she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend ever..

11:16.042 --> 11:20.035
I'll tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

11:20.280 --> 11:25.183
If I haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

11:26.286 --> 11:30.245
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?

11:32.458 --> 11:36.121
Is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?

11:38.464 --> 11:40.864
Oh, it's nice.
May I try a pink one?

11:43.570 --> 11:47.131
So I just have to plan
the perfect night.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.332
Hey, what's the best date
you ever had?

11:49.842 --> 11:53.073
Last year, Greg Hayman took me
to a very nice sushi dinner.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.181
Then we took a romantic walk
to a nearby research lab..

11:56.349 --> 11:58.943
where we trashed the place
and freed 20 monkeys.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.781
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!

12:05.358 --> 12:08.816
Last year, a monkey
did attack me at the bus stop!

12:11.531 --> 12:16.833
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross..

12:17.103 --> 12:19.128
it just isn't gonna happen.

12:19.372 --> 12:23.638
It'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.138
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:27.380 --> 12:32.044
How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.648
You're subdued.

12:34.854 --> 12:38.654
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.822
-Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
-Sure.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.998
Oh, me, right.

12:48.668 --> 12:52.536
-He's miserable. What happened to him?
-Nothing.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.139
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.772
Rachel stuff.

12:58.378 --> 13:03.782
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.451
He spends a day with you, and look!

13:08.388 --> 13:10.185
He's breathing.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.652
Okay, well, he's watching us
so just look happy, okay?

13:20.733 --> 13:23.065
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
-He's fine.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.395
Look.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.003
Here's your ball!

13:26.239 --> 13:29.504
Get your ball!
Get your ball!

13:29.842 --> 13:32.037
Get..

13:33.179 --> 13:34.441
Of course.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.514
You don't want a tennis ball.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.675
Not when you can have a meatball.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.613
Come on, get the meatball.

13:46.592 --> 13:49.755
God, what have I done to you?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.625
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
I broke the dog!

13:58.738 --> 14:00.069
Thanks.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.706
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?

14:09.949 --> 14:12.383
Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.

14:12.618 --> 14:16.884
I got my Chinese food on the way,
and your saltwater taffy.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.350
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater..

14:21.561 --> 14:24.860
We actually watched
the documentary together.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.234
Oh, my Chinese food.
I'll get my cash.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.070
Mona?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.937
What are..?
Hi! How are you?

14:40.246 --> 14:42.680
I'm supposed to pick you up.

14:42.915 --> 14:46.749
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!

14:50.256 --> 14:54.625
-Oh! Hey, Mona!
-Hi, Rachel.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.920
What's she doing here?

14:57.296 --> 14:59.491
I have no idea.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.799
I'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.903
What is she doing?

15:06.105 --> 15:09.472
Lately she just likes
hanging out here.

15:09.709 --> 15:13.008
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.

15:13.813 --> 15:17.146
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.682
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

15:20.953 --> 15:24.320
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

15:27.193 --> 15:29.855
That's just my Chinese food.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.053
She has food delivered here?

15:32.298 --> 15:37.065
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

15:38.838 --> 15:43.138
I'm gonna get in my sweats
and eat this in bed.

15:46.045 --> 15:50.004
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

15:50.550 --> 15:54.884
Open the champagne,
and I will be right back.

15:55.154 --> 15:59.454
-I've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?

16:00.726 --> 16:02.956
Please start drinking.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.231
-I'm just gonna grab the phone.
-Rachel, wait.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.101
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.707
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.736
No.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.916
Ross is too nice to say it,
but this is his apartment.

16:25.117 --> 16:29.486
We need boundaries, so why don't
you go back to your place.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.681
But, Mona, I live here.

16:34.894 --> 16:38.591
Happy Valentine's Day!

16:42.869 --> 16:47.431
Or, something to remember me by.

16:55.414 --> 16:59.009
-How long has it been this time?
-Ninety seconds.

16:59.252 --> 17:03.086
Ninety seconds is a long time
not to think about it.

17:03.322 --> 17:06.018
Except all I did was think about it.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.886
I know. It haunts me.

17:08.127 --> 17:13.929
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was
my dad doing shots off the houseboy.

17:14.166 --> 17:18.296
After this, I would gladly
make that my screen saver.

17:18.571 --> 17:23.599
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.270
I could do that.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.245
Now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.125
-Oh, thank God!
-I know.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.270
Come in!

17:53.439 --> 17:56.533
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

17:56.709 --> 18:00.509
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.079
-Oh, my God.
-Poor Ross.

18:06.686 --> 18:11.680
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,
but for this he closes the drapes.

18:13.125 --> 18:16.288
You know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

18:16.529 --> 18:17.587
It's here.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.893
We should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.632
You saw it? Is it scary?

18:24.837 --> 18:28.364
It's ironic how footage
of someone being born..

18:28.608 --> 18:31.600
can make you want to kill yourself.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.572
Honey, she may not have to watch it
but she's going to have to do it.

18:36.749 --> 18:40.742
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?

18:40.987 --> 18:45.583
No, but I'll leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.089
Monica, come on.
You want to have kids.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.125
I do.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.696
But the stork
is gonna bring mine.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.594
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.434
She's right. Of course not.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.804
Honey, get the tape.

19:12.852 --> 19:16.845
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

19:17.657 --> 19:21.218
Oh, sure. But if you leave a drumstick
under there and you're a bad roommate.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.022
Here we go.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.926
Okay.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.729
Oh, my.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.403
Come on, come on.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.940
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

19:38.144 --> 19:41.636
Why have I seen this thing
three times?

19:43.649 --> 19:44.877
It's beautiful.

19:45.084 --> 19:50.716
-It's horrible!
-I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!

19:51.657 --> 19:54.490
What do I do? I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?

19:55.795 --> 19:59.959
-You guys! You guys, look!
-What? Did her ass explode?

20:02.468 --> 20:05.596
No, the baby's out. Look.

20:07.273 --> 20:11.437
Look at those little fingers and toes.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.770
Look how happy the mom is now.

20:14.980 --> 20:19.383
-Oh, Rach.
-Screw you! You don't have to do it!

20:23.489 --> 20:25.286
-Hey.
-Hey!

20:25.558 --> 20:29.085
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.093
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

20:32.298 --> 20:36.792
Lately, I haven't exactly been
the perfect boyfriend.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.631
I didn't tell her
I got Rachel pregnant.

20:39.905 --> 20:44.968
I gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.736
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

20:48.981 --> 20:53.918
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.920
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.821
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

21:02.027 --> 21:04.928
Joey without a date
on Valentine's Day?

21:05.164 --> 21:08.463
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

21:09.935 --> 21:12.267
-Sort of.
-Really?

21:12.505 --> 21:15.372
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.142
Maybe I can help.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.346
Whatever it is,
I am sure it has happened to me.

21:24.483 --> 21:28.442
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.

21:33.492 --> 21:37.519
-So anyway, what is it?
-Forget about it. It's no big deal.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.265
-Come on, what is it?
-It's nothing.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.263
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

21:45.771 --> 21:49.366
Okay. Sit down.

21:53.212 --> 21:57.012
There's this woman that I like a lot.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.378
But it can't happen.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.145
She's not a Tribbiani?

22:04.857 --> 22:05.983
No!

22:07.426 --> 22:10.395
So is she someone from work?

22:11.931 --> 22:12.989
Yes.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.564
Well, does she like you?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.868
Sometimes I think she could.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.699
But I can't do anything about it.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.034
Why not?

22:24.310 --> 22:26.039
It's complicated.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.105
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.543
Someone from work too.

22:34.086 --> 22:37.613
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.383
Wait, I thought you
hated everyone at work.

22:40.659 --> 22:43.651
No, no. I only say that..

22:44.129 --> 22:48.759
so Chandler won't feel threatened
because I'm his only friend.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.068
Excuse me?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.730
Sorry, sorry.
And I'm your only friend too.

22:59.678 --> 23:04.877
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.985
-No, I don't think so.
-Okay.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.983
Is he a good guy?

23:11.624 --> 23:13.558
Yeah, he's the best.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.489
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.892
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.726
I do, so much.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.799
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..

23:25.070 --> 23:28.506
You know what?
You have to go for it.

23:28.741 --> 23:33.872
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.538
Here's your warm milk.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.146
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

23:46.158 --> 23:51.118
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

23:51.297 --> 23:53.765
Let me know how it goes.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.101
It's Rachel.

24:06.912 --> 24:10.075
You're having a baby
and you need to prepare.

24:10.282 --> 24:15.185
You're gonna make yourself watch
the whole thing. Just do it!

24:18.390 --> 24:21.951
I came to the big city
to become a star.

24:22.594 --> 24:26.792
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?

24:26.966 --> 24:31.494
Maybe it starts with
how she gets pregnant.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.831
I wonder which one of these guys
becomes the father.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.172
No, no.
Can't get pregnant that way.
