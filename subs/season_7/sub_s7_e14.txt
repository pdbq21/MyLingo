WEBVTT

00:05.117 --> 00:06.277
Happy birthday!

00:06.485 --> 00:07.679
Happy birthday!

00:10.689 --> 00:12.316
Rach, come on.

00:12.958 --> 00:13.947
It's your birthday!

00:14.793 --> 00:15.817
Hey....

00:17.429 --> 00:20.626
She's not as pretty as
she was when she was 29.

00:21.867 --> 00:26.497
Ms. Green wants to estabIish some
ground ruIes before she comes out.

00:26.705 --> 00:30.072
She'd appreciate it if you didn't use
the words ''oId'' or ''downhiII'' ...

00:30.309 --> 00:32.800
...or ''They stiII Iook
pretty damn good.''

00:36.915 --> 00:38.109
They do.

00:39.384 --> 00:41.181
RacheI, come on out.

00:41.687 --> 00:43.314
Monica made breakfast.

00:43.522 --> 00:44.955
ChocoIate chip pancakes.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.357
We've got presents.

00:50.429 --> 00:51.828
Good ones?

00:52.397 --> 00:55.764
They aII came from the Iist
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

00:56.368 --> 00:59.394
Can I keep the presents
and stiII be 29?

01:00.439 --> 01:03.875
Come on, Rach, turning 30
is not that big a deaI.

01:04.242 --> 01:07.040
ReaIIy? Is that how you feIt
when you turned 30?

01:07.279 --> 01:09.270
Why, God, why?

01:09.948 --> 01:13.475
We had a deaI.
Let the others grow oId, not me!

01:22.427 --> 01:26.227
You know, I'm stiII 29 in Guam.

01:27.332 --> 01:29.892
Hey, 30 is not that oId.

01:30.068 --> 01:32.832
Do you know how oId the Earth is?

01:34.573 --> 01:36.040
Late 30s?

01:37.376 --> 01:40.004
You guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

01:40.212 --> 01:44.876
No, it's not just you.
My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.

01:45.617 --> 01:47.141
And now ChandIer!

01:49.154 --> 01:51.054
We're aII getting so oId.

01:51.256 --> 01:53.816
Why are you doing this to us?

01:58.030 --> 02:00.157
The One Where They AII Turn Thirty

02:35.500 --> 02:40.130
You're in a great pIace in your Iife.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

02:40.305 --> 02:42.364
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

02:42.674 --> 02:44.471
Your character is in a coma.

02:46.745 --> 02:49.680
I promised myseIf
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

02:51.249 --> 02:54.810
I know my Iife's going pretty weII,
but I see so many peopIe...

02:55.053 --> 02:58.454
...who've accompIished their goaIs
before they're 30.

02:58.657 --> 03:01.490
Yeah, but you shouIdn't compare
yourseIf to me.

03:02.594 --> 03:04.892
-Come on, Phoebe!
-You can do it!

03:05.864 --> 03:07.354
-Come on.
-There you go.

03:13.872 --> 03:17.103
I did it!
One miIe on a Hippity Hop.

03:17.743 --> 03:20.906
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

03:21.179 --> 03:24.012
E<i>x</i>cept I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

03:24.249 --> 03:25.409
Oh, weII. But, yeah!

03:27.419 --> 03:31.082
GirIs, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean.

03:41.166 --> 03:44.294
Thirty. Oh, I mean, 30.

03:44.469 --> 03:48.496
Monica, you remember mean, oId
Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was 30.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.768
Let's have some fun.
What do you want to do?

03:52.944 --> 03:54.707
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

03:54.913 --> 03:59.873
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, Iike Ross.

04:00.752 --> 04:02.947
That was a practicaI purchase.

04:03.188 --> 04:05.918
I needed that car for transportation.

04:06.191 --> 04:08.557
Okay? I have a chiId.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.288
How hot do I Iook in this?

04:13.131 --> 04:14.655
Ross, a sports car?

04:14.866 --> 04:18.199
WouIdn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

04:19.070 --> 04:21.129
That's not what this is about.

04:21.373 --> 04:23.637
I am a sports car enthusiast.

04:23.875 --> 04:27.572
-I've aIways been into cars.
-What's the horsepower?

04:28.079 --> 04:30.377
I don't know, but Iook how shiny!

04:32.784 --> 04:38.086
-I can't beIieve you bought this.
-ReaIIy. God, Ross, what were you thinking?

04:38.256 --> 04:41.157
I know it's reaIIy shaIIow,
but part of me wants him again.

04:41.326 --> 04:44.056
WeII, get in Iine, missy.

04:44.763 --> 04:46.424
So can I have a ride, stud?

04:46.731 --> 04:48.096
Hop in.

04:49.434 --> 04:53.063
Get ready for the
smoothest ride of your Iife.

05:17.395 --> 05:18.760
Damn it.

05:20.732 --> 05:22.495
Okay, who's ne<i>x</i>t?

05:25.437 --> 05:29.897
I am gonna do something today. I'm
not just gonna sit around Iike some oId Iady.

05:30.108 --> 05:32.474
I want to get something pierced.

05:32.711 --> 05:36.010
Like my nose or my tongue or something.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.943
ReaIIy? Because that hurts.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.013
So what?
The way I see it--

05:40.252 --> 05:41.719
Son of a bitch!

05:43.655 --> 05:46.283
Look, I know what
you're going through.

05:46.491 --> 05:49.756
I'm totaIIy freaked out
about turning 25.

05:53.231 --> 05:55.096
Get out of my apartment.

05:56.101 --> 05:58.592
Rach, I think that you're doing great.

05:58.837 --> 06:01.635
Let's face it,
no one handIes this weII.

06:02.007 --> 06:03.770
Least of aII you.

06:04.776 --> 06:08.473
-Why, what did you do?
-Weren't you asked to Ieave, sonny?

06:14.519 --> 06:17.181
Put that back on.
Monica wiII be here any minute.

06:17.422 --> 06:19.583
But it hurts my Joey's appIe.

06:22.093 --> 06:26.826
For the Iast time, it's not named
after each individuaI man.

06:30.468 --> 06:34.529
You've done a wonderfuI job with
this party, ChandIer. Everything's so IoveIy.

06:34.773 --> 06:36.297
WeII, not as IoveIy as you.

06:36.541 --> 06:39.999
I can't beIieve you have a
30-year-oId daughter.

06:40.211 --> 06:44.045
And I can't beIieve you have
a tu<i>x</i> that's 30 years oId.

06:44.916 --> 06:49.444
It's oIder than that. Ross was actuaIIy
conceived right near this tu<i>x</i>edo.

06:52.557 --> 06:54.548
Everybody hide! I saw her.
She's coming.

06:55.493 --> 06:57.324
Everybody down!

06:58.163 --> 06:59.755
Crap.

07:04.869 --> 07:08.430
Everybody stay here.
I'II find out what's going on.

07:10.475 --> 07:13.273
Hey, you got the door open!

07:15.046 --> 07:17.241
Hey, are you drunk?

07:17.515 --> 07:18.675
No.

07:21.019 --> 07:22.179
Okay.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.823
Okay.

07:29.260 --> 07:32.593
See, I was a IittIe nervous
about turning...

07:32.864 --> 07:34.229
...30.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.228
So the busboys took me out
for some drinks.

07:41.439 --> 07:44.067
Might want to puke on you Iater.

07:45.610 --> 07:50.547
Here's the thing. We've thrown
a very formaI surprise party for you.

07:50.749 --> 07:53.650
-Your friends are in there, and your parents.
-No!

07:53.885 --> 07:54.909
-Yes! Yes!
-No.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.351
Oh, no! My parents have never
seen me drunk.

07:58.757 --> 08:00.088
That they know of.

08:01.059 --> 08:05.257
We'II get you some coffee.
They'II never know that you're drunk.

08:05.463 --> 08:07.954
-You promise?
-I'II take care of it.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.225
I Iove you so much.

08:10.568 --> 08:14.504
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.806
What about your breath?

08:18.877 --> 08:20.902
That's stiII yours.

08:22.647 --> 08:25.514
Now remember,
it's a surprise party.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.082
So when you go in, act surprised.

08:29.487 --> 08:30.647
Ready?

08:37.962 --> 08:39.259
Surprise!

08:45.470 --> 08:47.131
Okay, forward. Forward.

08:47.338 --> 08:48.498
Stop!

08:50.041 --> 08:51.633
Okay, back-- Stop!

08:53.611 --> 08:54.976
Okay, for-- Stop!

08:55.180 --> 08:56.772
Stop! Stop!

08:57.248 --> 09:00.217
Ross, just forget about it.
The guy's got you totaIIy wedged in.

09:01.820 --> 09:06.450
-Is this yours?
-No, it's mine! It's mine.

09:07.992 --> 09:10.654
Dude, you so need this car.

09:12.831 --> 09:15.061
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.063
I'II break into this minivan,
put it in neutraI.

09:18.303 --> 09:21.101
You push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

09:22.407 --> 09:24.204
AII right. Here we go.

09:30.448 --> 09:31.710
HauI ass!

09:43.394 --> 09:45.885
Happy 30th birthday! Here.

09:47.031 --> 09:49.966
It's for the chiId in you.
And the woman.

09:50.735 --> 09:51.929
Happy 30th!

09:52.137 --> 09:53.934
Right. Why do you keep saying that?

09:54.272 --> 09:56.604
Because it's our 30th birthday.

09:56.841 --> 10:00.208
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31 . Okay.

10:01.045 --> 10:02.410
Wait.

10:04.449 --> 10:06.041
Oh, it's you.

10:06.251 --> 10:07.946
Yeah. What?

10:08.153 --> 10:10.212
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31 .

10:11.890 --> 10:14.381
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

10:14.592 --> 10:16.150
You have a birth certificate?

10:16.427 --> 10:19.294
I got a big bo<i>x</i> of famiIy stuff
when my mom died.

10:19.964 --> 10:21.261
Our mom.

10:21.432 --> 10:22.626
Right. Okay.

10:24.402 --> 10:28.463
-Do you have mine?
-No, I soId it to a Swedish runaway.

10:31.242 --> 10:32.641
Oh, my God.

10:33.578 --> 10:35.671
Oh, my God, we are 31 !

10:35.947 --> 10:37.437
Yeah.

10:38.449 --> 10:41.282
I just Iost a whoIe year of my Iife.

10:41.519 --> 10:42.781
Okay.

10:44.255 --> 10:46.780
-Your middIe name is PameIa?
-Yes.

10:46.991 --> 10:50.017
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

10:50.295 --> 10:52.388
Yes. Phoebe.

10:53.631 --> 10:57.431
-That's my first name.
-Right. Okay. Then, no.

11:01.172 --> 11:04.039
We made it across the room.
You're doing great.

11:04.475 --> 11:05.533
What's going on?

11:05.777 --> 11:07.335
Monica's a IittIe drunk.

11:07.645 --> 11:09.670
Yeah! I Iove drunk Monica.

11:11.216 --> 11:14.447
Oh, she's so much more fun
than reguIar Monica.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.782
She doesn't want her parents to know.

11:20.358 --> 11:23.350
AII right, aII right.
Here's what we'II do.

11:23.561 --> 11:27.520
I'II get twice as drunk,
then no one wiII even notice her.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.296
-Drunk Phoebe's mean.
-Okay, you watch your tone with me!

11:37.675 --> 11:39.108
What's going on?

11:40.044 --> 11:41.238
Monica's wasted.

11:41.446 --> 11:44.040
Maybe that wiII Iiven up this party.

11:44.749 --> 11:47.115
WiII you just heIp her get changed?

11:47.452 --> 11:50.785
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems Iike a job for Joey.

11:55.793 --> 11:57.727
This one's from me.

11:57.962 --> 12:00.590
It wasn't on your Iist,
but it's reaIIy fun.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.994
A scooter.

12:05.770 --> 12:07.931
Stick to the Iist.

12:09.574 --> 12:12.634
AIways stick to the Iist.

12:13.344 --> 12:15.778
No, no, I Iove it. Thank you.

12:16.781 --> 12:18.772
Open ours ne<i>x</i>t! Open ours ne<i>x</i>t!

12:18.983 --> 12:21.474
Now that you're a coupIe,
we don't get two gifts?

12:21.719 --> 12:24.813
For my Iast birthday,
you gave me a hug.

12:25.723 --> 12:27.816
Read the card! Read the card!

12:31.629 --> 12:33.961
''Happy birthday, Grandma.

12:36.267 --> 12:38.963
It's better to be over the hiII...

12:39.637 --> 12:41.764
...than buried under it.

12:44.876 --> 12:47.936
AII our Iove, Monica and ChandIer.''
That's funny.

12:48.179 --> 12:50.545
No, no. That was a joke.

12:50.782 --> 12:53.546
I know, I get it. It's funny.

12:53.785 --> 12:55.753
Because you're not a grandma.

12:55.953 --> 12:59.480
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have chiIdren.

12:59.691 --> 13:04.185
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

13:04.796 --> 13:06.195
I'm just gonna go....

13:10.768 --> 13:13.566
AII you had to do was buy the card.

13:18.910 --> 13:22.402
Hey, Iook who's back.
It's the birthday girI.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.344
How's the birthday girI feeIing?

13:27.318 --> 13:30.810
WeII, I feeI fine, but I think
you're bumming out the rest of the kids.

13:34.726 --> 13:38.685
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.

13:38.930 --> 13:41.194
AII I reaIIy needed was a pIan.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.395
See, I want three kids.

13:43.668 --> 13:48.662
And you want to have them aII at the
same time and have them for your brother.

13:50.508 --> 13:52.203
As I was saying....

13:52.677 --> 13:55.942
I shouId have the first one
by the time I'm 35.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.307
Which gives me five years.

13:58.816 --> 14:01.011
I Iove this pIan. I'm gonna marry this pIan.

14:01.185 --> 14:04.052
If you couId do that,
I'd marry the Hippity Hop.

14:05.189 --> 14:09.353
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
have to get pregnant untiI I'm 34.

14:09.594 --> 14:13.291
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity cIothes.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.034
But I want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

14:20.405 --> 14:22.305
ReaIIy? That Iong?

14:27.145 --> 14:30.114
Look aII you want, it's happening.

14:33.017 --> 14:37.113
I don't have to get married untiI
I'm 33. That's three whoIe years.

14:37.388 --> 14:38.616
Wait a minute, though.

14:38.890 --> 14:42.451
I'II need a year and a haIf
to pIan the wedding.

14:42.727 --> 14:45.662
And I'd Iike to know the guy
for a year, year and a haIf...

14:45.930 --> 14:48.091
...before we get engaged.

14:49.033 --> 14:53.265
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

14:54.605 --> 14:58.598
Which is fine
because you just turned...

14:58.843 --> 15:00.572
...28!

15:01.612 --> 15:03.842
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

15:04.081 --> 15:07.608
I shouId aIready be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.616
WiII you <i>q</i>uit hogging it?

15:21.799 --> 15:25.701
I'm teIIing you, it's Iike
watching Bambi Iearn how to waIk.

15:27.205 --> 15:28.604
You're drunk.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.532
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

15:34.745 --> 15:36.610
Maybe I'm a IittIe drunk.

15:39.350 --> 15:40.612
Are those crab cakes?

15:40.885 --> 15:44.582
Did I not teII you to come straight to me
when more crab cakes were ready?

15:46.858 --> 15:48.223
How you feeIing?

15:49.193 --> 15:51.855
You are so handsome.

15:53.798 --> 15:57.131
I want to make Iove to you
right here, right now.

15:59.904 --> 16:02.737
I reaIIy wish that you wouIdn't.

16:08.279 --> 16:12.978
Just get through a IittIe bit more,
then we can put you in bed.

16:13.251 --> 16:17.278
Just smiIe and don't taIk to anyone.

16:17.989 --> 16:21.789
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girI.

16:22.860 --> 16:23.884
Pheebs!

16:24.095 --> 16:26.086
See, everybody's Iooking at me.

16:26.297 --> 16:27.730
The pIan's working.

16:28.933 --> 16:31.902
I didn't even have to
take off my top yet.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.370
Speech. Come on, speech!

16:37.975 --> 16:41.308
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.

16:41.579 --> 16:43.103
I think it's nice.

16:43.314 --> 16:45.282
I think it's necessary.

16:53.424 --> 16:56.257
I want to thank you aII for coming.

16:56.694 --> 16:58.423
My famiIy and...

16:58.663 --> 16:59.687
...my friends.

17:03.901 --> 17:06.495
I'd reaIIy Iike to say that I'm....

17:08.406 --> 17:11.273
You know what I'd reaIIy Iike to say?

17:12.009 --> 17:13.704
I'm drunk!

17:16.314 --> 17:18.179
That's right, Mom and Dad.

17:18.416 --> 17:21.783
Your IittIe Harmomica is hammered.

17:24.322 --> 17:25.311
And guess what?

17:25.556 --> 17:27.547
I've been drunk before.

17:28.426 --> 17:30.917
And I've smoked a cigarette.

17:32.129 --> 17:35.826
And I've had a bo<i>x</i> of Ding Dongs
hidden in my underwear drawer.

17:38.069 --> 17:40.731
It's aII okay.
It's okay because...

17:41.005 --> 17:42.870
...I turned 30 today.

17:43.908 --> 17:46.536
And I can do anything I want.

17:47.044 --> 17:49.877
Because I am a grownup.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.416
Okay, <i>q</i>uick. HeIp me get this off.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.927
I Iost a whoIe year.

18:04.128 --> 18:06.756
I can't beIieve it.
This is so unfair!

18:06.964 --> 18:08.932
Come on, Pheebs, it'II be okay.

18:09.133 --> 18:10.430
WiII it? WiII it?

18:11.769 --> 18:14.431
How wouId you feeI if
you found out you were 31 ?

18:14.639 --> 18:18.473
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deaI.

18:19.777 --> 18:21.904
PIus, it ruined my scheduIe.

18:22.113 --> 18:26.140
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31 .

18:26.350 --> 18:30.650
-Like what?
-Like I haven't met any Portuguese peopIe.

18:30.921 --> 18:33.481
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

18:33.724 --> 18:35.954
And I haven't been to sniper schooI.

18:37.995 --> 18:41.158
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake.

18:41.532 --> 18:45.628

See you guys Iater. Thanks.

18:47.805 --> 18:49.170

18:56.747 --> 18:59.307
-Oh, man.

19:26.210 --> 19:27.677
Oh, yeah.

19:29.714 --> 19:32.478

19:36.687 --> 19:38.780

Oh, okay.

20:42.853 --> 20:44.912
Whatever. I'm not your mother.

20:45.923 --> 20:47.618
Not in the street!

20:51.328 --> 20:55.560
-Are you feeIing any better?

And we have so much fun together.

21:08.746 --> 21:09.974
-But I--
-Wait.

21:10.948 --> 21:12.916
I think I see where you're going.

21:13.150 --> 21:16.847
But before you say anything eIse,
can I say one more thing?

21:25.362 --> 21:26.727
WeII said.

21:29.099 --> 21:32.364
And a good e<i>x</i>ampIe of the fun
I was referring to.

21:33.737 --> 21:38.731
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.

21:38.943 --> 21:42.470
RacheI, don't do this. This is just
because you're turning 30.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.170
Yeah, it is.

21:44.982 --> 21:48.247
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

21:48.953 --> 21:51.251
-Twenty-four, actuaIIy.
-Oh, God.

21:53.757 --> 21:58.660
You know what I wish?
I wish you were si<i>x</i> years oIder.

21:58.896 --> 22:03.299

22:04.335 --> 22:07.099
-Me too.
-Yeah. Sorry.
