WEBVTT

00:02.257 --> 00:04.589
All right, they got water,
orange juice...

00:04.759 --> 00:07.353
...and what looks like cider.

00:07.896 --> 00:08.885
Taste it.

00:14.002 --> 00:16.562
Yeah, it's fat.
I drank fat!

00:18.306 --> 00:20.365
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

00:24.246 --> 00:25.679
Hey, Mr. Tux.

00:25.881 --> 00:28.509
- Why aren't you dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

00:28.683 --> 00:31.914
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 7:40.

00:32.154 --> 00:35.715
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us
two minutes to get dressed.

00:35.891 --> 00:38.086
I'd feel better if you
got dressed now.

00:38.593 --> 00:39.992
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:43.832 --> 00:45.857
Oh, look at you. All sexy.

00:46.034 --> 00:47.023
Really?

00:52.407 --> 00:58.107
- How come you didn't come over earlier?
- Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.

00:58.813 --> 01:01.714
- Hey, Ross, want some cider?
- No.

01:03.218 --> 01:04.981
So you're pretty close, huh?

01:05.187 --> 01:08.645
- Makeup's on. Hair's done.
- I just have to get dressed.

01:08.924 --> 01:11.688
And that takes what,
six or seven minutes?

01:11.960 --> 01:14.394
Yeah. Once I figure out
what I'm wearing.

01:17.132 --> 01:18.360
Glass of fat?

01:20.068 --> 01:22.229
The One Where No One's Ready

02:08.717 --> 02:11.584
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?

02:11.853 --> 02:13.218
Nope.

02:14.756 --> 02:18.123
- You wanna hear it?
- Am I in it?

02:21.730 --> 02:24.528
After I thank everyone
for giving to the museum...

02:24.766 --> 02:27.530
...I sing a song about
the wonder that is Joey.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.232
Hello! You look great!

02:33.508 --> 02:35.635
Thank you. I know, though.

02:37.245 --> 02:41.341
You see this? This is a person
who is ready to go.

02:41.516 --> 02:42.505
Phoebe, you...

02:43.018 --> 02:44.110
You are my star.

02:45.220 --> 02:47.688
Well, you're my lucky penny.

02:50.425 --> 02:55.556
All right, I took the quiz. And it
turns out I do put career before men.

02:58.633 --> 02:59.861
Get up.

03:00.035 --> 03:01.229
What?

03:01.403 --> 03:04.031
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

03:07.509 --> 03:10.410
- Because I was sitting there.
- But you left.

03:11.012 --> 03:13.537
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

03:14.382 --> 03:16.782
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.

03:16.951 --> 03:18.748
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!

03:18.953 --> 03:22.514
The big deal is I was
sitting there last! So...

03:22.757 --> 03:24.054
...it's my seat.

03:24.592 --> 03:28.756
Well, actually, the last place
you were sitting was in there, so...

03:29.264 --> 03:31.824
You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

03:32.067 --> 03:36.595
You both have to go get dressed before
the big vein in my head pops.

03:36.871 --> 03:39.635
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.

03:39.908 --> 03:41.034
Get up!

03:44.079 --> 03:46.343
Phoebe, you look great!

03:46.948 --> 03:48.779
All right already.

03:49.718 --> 03:51.583
Are you gonna do magic?

03:54.089 --> 03:55.954
That's funny. Change.

03:56.124 --> 03:57.989
- I just got in.
- I don't care.

03:58.259 --> 04:03.162
- It starts at 8. We can't be late.
- He could not, would not, want to wait.

04:03.898 --> 04:06.628
Our table is in front.
My boss will be there.

04:06.901 --> 04:09.392
Everyone will see if we arrive
after it starts.

04:09.571 --> 04:11.539
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

04:13.074 --> 04:16.942
Does this look like something a
paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

04:17.112 --> 04:19.637
I don't know.
You might be the first one.

04:20.949 --> 04:23.213
- Rach, did you check the machine?
- No.

04:23.385 --> 04:27.583
Wait. This is the outfit that makes
my calves look fat. Never mind.

04:31.393 --> 04:34.260
Well, Joey, I wrote
a little song today.

04:34.696 --> 04:36.186
It's called, "Get up!"

04:37.732 --> 04:40.792
I wish there was something
I could do to help you.

04:40.969 --> 04:44.803
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

04:44.973 --> 04:47.635
All right. You can have the chair.

04:47.842 --> 04:51.141
- Really?
- Oh, my. Would you look at that?

04:55.183 --> 04:56.673
It's me, I'm coming over.

04:56.918 --> 04:59.512
What if I'm already there
when you play this message?

04:59.754 --> 05:01.654
Is that too spooky?

05:03.792 --> 05:06.192
Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me. Pick up.

05:06.761 --> 05:08.661
Rachel? Rach?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.457
What?

05:11.866 --> 05:13.959
Never mind.

05:14.335 --> 05:15.859
Hi, Rach, it's your sister.

05:16.037 --> 05:19.734
Did you ever sleep with Donnie Mazzio
because last night he kept shouting:

05:19.908 --> 05:21.933
"Two for two."

05:23.445 --> 05:27.711
Do you want me to get dressed
or hear a long story about a hayride?

05:27.882 --> 05:30.214
Are you only asking him because...

05:35.490 --> 05:38.186
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

05:41.663 --> 05:44.530
Is that message old or new?

05:44.699 --> 05:46.291
Old or new? Old or new?

05:46.568 --> 05:49.469
It's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?

05:49.637 --> 05:52.003
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.

05:52.207 --> 05:55.005
It could be important.
Shouldn't I call him back?

05:55.210 --> 05:57.644
Honey, you did call him back.
It's old.

05:57.846 --> 05:59.939
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

06:00.148 --> 06:02.275
When Carol and I broke up...

06:02.517 --> 06:05.577
...I went through the same thing.
You know what I did?

06:05.787 --> 06:07.778
I got dressed.

06:10.358 --> 06:13.293
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

06:13.495 --> 06:15.520
There we go. There we go.

06:16.297 --> 06:18.731
You know what? Don't get up.
Just sit there.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.026
I just hope you don't mind
my hand right here.

06:23.338 --> 06:26.637
Not touching. Can't get mad!
Not touching. Can't get mad!

06:26.808 --> 06:29.038
Not touching. Can't get mad!

06:30.378 --> 06:33.677
Oh, my God!
You rotten boys!

06:34.716 --> 06:37.116
- Sorry, Phoebe.
- What am I gonna do?

06:37.285 --> 06:41.312
Don't rub it! What gets out hummus?
What gets out hummus?

06:41.489 --> 06:43.582
Monica!
What gets out hummus?

06:44.559 --> 06:48.393
If it is a new message,
what is he calling to say?

06:48.730 --> 06:51.130
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

06:52.567 --> 06:54.933
Maybe he called to say you're obsessive.

06:55.103 --> 06:57.230
- So should I call him back?
- No!

06:58.640 --> 06:59.664
No!

07:01.376 --> 07:03.344
Okay, do these match?

07:03.511 --> 07:06.708
- Yes, they definitely match.
- They don't match.

07:10.752 --> 07:13.186
What? They didn't match.

07:13.354 --> 07:17.051
- Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
- Fine with me.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.327
I am so comfortable.

07:23.531 --> 07:24.520
Me too.

07:24.899 --> 07:28.494
In fact, I think I might
be a little too comfortable.

07:28.670 --> 07:30.399
All right.

07:32.607 --> 07:36.168
Okay, we have 19 minutes.
I want you to go and change.

07:36.411 --> 07:40.609
When you come back, Joey will go
change and he'll have vacated the chair.

07:41.015 --> 07:42.073
- Okay.
- All right.

07:42.350 --> 07:44.113
Fine. I'm going.

07:44.285 --> 07:47.686
When I get back, it's Chair City.
And I'm the guy...

07:47.889 --> 07:49.618
...who's sitting in a chair!

07:51.726 --> 07:53.057
Is this a little too...?

07:53.294 --> 07:55.489
Pheebs? What happened?

07:55.663 --> 07:57.028
I got the hummus.

07:57.198 --> 08:01.157
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?

08:01.369 --> 08:03.564
- It won't go with this dress.
- You're right.

08:03.838 --> 08:08.298
- Well, let's just get you out of that.
- No, no, no. Not "out of that."

08:08.476 --> 08:11.707
- Not out of clothes.
- Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

08:11.879 --> 08:13.176
I called him.

08:14.015 --> 08:17.143
Yes. I got his machine
and I left a message.

08:17.385 --> 08:18.852
But it's okay. It's okay...

08:19.087 --> 08:22.250
...because it was, like,
a casual, breezy message.

08:22.523 --> 08:23.547
It was breezy.

08:24.459 --> 08:26.450
God, what if it wasn't breezy?

08:26.628 --> 08:30.997
How could it not be breezy? No.
Because you're in such a breezy place.

08:31.699 --> 08:36.033
I got it. I will play my message and
you can tell me if it's breezy enough.

08:36.204 --> 08:38.297
But how you gonna do that?

08:38.806 --> 08:41.297
I know the code
to his answering machine.

08:41.542 --> 08:44.067
Okay, Mon, I really don't think
this is the...

08:44.312 --> 08:47.042
Okay, you're dialing.
You are dialing.

08:58.326 --> 09:01.124
- What's going on?
- Monica's beeping into Richard's machine.

09:01.295 --> 09:02.557
Is she crazy?

09:02.730 --> 09:04.595
Like a straw.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.323
Remember? Crazy straws?

09:08.503 --> 09:12.371
Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.236
You have two new messages.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.105
Wow, what a cool job.

09:17.378 --> 09:19.346
You have two new messages.

09:21.149 --> 09:23.515
Please pass the pie.

09:25.853 --> 09:29.880
Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking
in because I got a message...

09:30.058 --> 09:34.188
...from you and didn't know
if it was old or new. So I'm checking.

09:34.395 --> 09:36.022
So let me know.

09:36.264 --> 09:37.663
Or don't. Whatever.

09:37.832 --> 09:39.459
I'm breezy!

09:40.802 --> 09:44.329
You can't say you're breezy.
That negates the breezy.

09:46.574 --> 09:50.101
Hola. It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.

09:50.278 --> 09:52.872
Call me about this weekend, okay?

09:55.783 --> 09:57.410
Now, she sounded breezy.

10:05.827 --> 10:09.263
He's seeing someone.
I can't believe he's seeing someone.

10:09.430 --> 10:11.990
- You don't know that.
- Well, whose voice was that?

10:12.200 --> 10:15.192
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.

10:16.571 --> 10:20.564
Michelle. Of course! It was Michelle.
Did it sound like Michelle?

10:21.776 --> 10:23.971
I cannot remember her.

10:25.913 --> 10:30.213
Great. It's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.

10:30.918 --> 10:31.907
It was Michelle.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.848
It was definitely Michelle.

10:34.122 --> 10:38.286
Try Monica's green dress. If it
doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

10:38.559 --> 10:41.255
- Unless I wear it.
- You don't know what you're wearing?

10:41.429 --> 10:44.125
I'm just trying to look nice
for your big night.

10:44.298 --> 10:47.461
Which we have
to leave for in 12 minutes.

10:47.635 --> 10:49.694
I'll pick something out for you.

10:49.871 --> 10:53.534
- There! There! That looks good.
- Ross, that's a towel!

10:54.942 --> 10:57.672
You will notice that I am fully dressed.

10:57.845 --> 11:01.212
I, in turn, have noticed
that you are not.

11:01.449 --> 11:06.318
So in the words of A.A. Milne,
"Get out of my chair, dill-hole."

11:08.723 --> 11:10.088
Okay.

11:17.765 --> 11:20.393
- What are you doing?
- You said to give you the chair.

11:20.635 --> 11:22.728
You didn't say anything about cushions.

11:22.904 --> 11:24.701
They're the essence
of the chair!

11:24.872 --> 11:27.466
That's right! I'm taking the essence.

11:28.576 --> 11:30.407
Oh, he'll be back.

11:30.611 --> 11:33.045
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

11:33.648 --> 11:37.345
- I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
- That was a Halloween costume.

11:37.585 --> 11:40.918
Unless you would like me to go
as Little Bo Peep.

11:41.355 --> 11:44.153
I didn't recognize it
without that inflatable sheep.

11:44.325 --> 11:48.125
Which, by the way, Chandler,
I would like back one of these days.

11:50.798 --> 11:53.392
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this
perfect for me?

11:53.634 --> 11:56.125
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

11:56.304 --> 11:59.603
Of course, not for tonight.
Hi. I'm going to a benefit.

11:59.807 --> 12:02.037
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?

12:02.210 --> 12:05.475
No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
I love you. Breathe.

12:06.881 --> 12:09.873
We used them as pillows
when we went camping.

12:10.084 --> 12:11.073
What?

12:12.086 --> 12:13.519
The sheep.

12:14.689 --> 12:17.590
Hey, what you do on your own time...

12:21.162 --> 12:22.959
Where's my underwear?

12:23.798 --> 12:27.393
- Come on, you took his underwear?
- He took my essence!

12:27.568 --> 12:32.505
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear
the underwear you're wearing now?

12:32.673 --> 12:35.335
Because I'm not wearing
any underwear now.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.935
Why do you have
to wear underwear tonight?

12:39.113 --> 12:40.808
It's a rented tux, okay?

12:41.048 --> 12:44.484
I'm not gonna go commando
in another man's fatigues.

12:46.687 --> 12:50.282
Then somebody's gonna have
to give somebody back his cushions.

12:50.958 --> 12:55.292
Okay. You hide my clothes, I'm gonna
do the exact opposite to you.

12:57.465 --> 13:00.798
What, are you gonna
show me my clothes?

13:00.968 --> 13:02.230
Hey, opposite...

13:03.237 --> 13:04.465
...is opposite.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.932
He's got nothing!

13:08.943 --> 13:10.706
Okay, I'm ready.

13:15.683 --> 13:18.846
Rachel didn't have anything
I liked but this ribbon.

13:19.053 --> 13:21.681
I thought, all right,
I'll be political.

13:23.257 --> 13:26.317
- What are you supporting?
- Christmas.

13:27.862 --> 13:32.822
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,
and I have exactly 12 minutes...

13:33.701 --> 13:35.191
What?

13:35.569 --> 13:37.901
My watch stopped.
My watch. Okay, see...

13:38.072 --> 13:41.269
...the dinosaur tail
isn't going around anymore.

13:41.676 --> 13:45.874
What time is it? It's 7:33. I have
seven minutes. I have seven minutes!

13:46.047 --> 13:48.880
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?

13:49.183 --> 13:51.583
- Just pick one, okay?
- Oh, okay, okay. The black.

13:51.786 --> 13:54.380
Do you have black
with little strappies?

13:54.555 --> 13:58.651
Yeah. But those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.

13:58.826 --> 14:03.763
Yeah, pants! What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.

14:03.931 --> 14:07.059
I don't know what you're doing,
but just get in there...

14:07.335 --> 14:09.803
...and pick out any shoes
that fit your feet.

14:10.004 --> 14:13.462
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make...

14:13.708 --> 14:18.338
...your ankles or your knees or your
earlobes look fat. Just do it!

14:18.546 --> 14:21.208
Go in there, pick something out
so we can go.

14:24.018 --> 14:26.509
- All right.
- Thank you.

14:27.388 --> 14:31.051
I've got to call Michelle to see
if that was her voice.

14:31.292 --> 14:33.226
It was. It was her voice.

14:33.394 --> 14:36.454
Monica, I think you've gone over
to the bad place.

14:40.534 --> 14:42.331
Hola.

14:42.703 --> 14:45.001
Hello? Hello?

14:46.374 --> 14:49.434
- Okay. That was her, right?
- Definitely. Yeah.

14:49.710 --> 14:51.302
So there you go.

14:51.712 --> 14:55.045
We're out of the woods.
I think I'll get dressed now.

14:56.584 --> 14:58.347
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.087
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

15:01.589 --> 15:04.615
Yeah, just a second.
Can I ask who's calling?

15:04.825 --> 15:06.292
It's Michelle!

15:08.396 --> 15:12.355
She must have that caller ID thing.
You should get that.

15:15.369 --> 15:16.495
Michelle?

15:17.071 --> 15:20.905
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.

15:21.142 --> 15:22.268
Just try to be...

15:24.278 --> 15:25.711
You're so sweet.

15:26.414 --> 15:28.507
Yeah, we were a great couple.

15:28.682 --> 15:30.650
I know, I really miss him.

15:31.218 --> 15:33.880
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that...

15:34.055 --> 15:35.716
You know what's weird?

15:37.658 --> 15:39.751
Donald Duck never wore pants.

15:41.162 --> 15:43.062
But when he gets
out of the shower...

15:43.297 --> 15:45.925
...he always puts a towel
around his waist.

15:48.602 --> 15:51.469
I mean, what is that about?

15:52.473 --> 15:57.001
I only beeped in so I could hear my
own message. I mean, that's allowed.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.014
I would really appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell your dad about...

16:04.251 --> 16:08.654
What do you mean, you don't feel
comfortable with this? We're friends!

16:09.890 --> 16:11.824
That bitch always hated me.

16:12.093 --> 16:13.458
I'm calling her back.

16:15.696 --> 16:17.459
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

16:18.766 --> 16:22.099
- She's got a phone in there, right?
- Okay, we're on it.

16:33.147 --> 16:36.810
I know it says "black tie optional"...

16:37.051 --> 16:39.713
...but this may be pushing it a little.

16:40.154 --> 16:41.781
I'm not gonna go.

16:43.958 --> 16:45.186
You're not gonna go?

16:45.459 --> 16:49.122
No, I think I'm gonna catch up
on my correspondence.

16:50.564 --> 16:53.624
How can you not be going?

16:54.201 --> 16:55.498
I'm not gonna go.

16:55.736 --> 16:59.467
So I think that will accomplish
the not going.

17:04.378 --> 17:06.869
You know, just out of curiosity...

17:07.047 --> 17:10.346
Since I was humiliated
and yelled at in front of my friends...

17:10.584 --> 17:15.317
...I'm just, I don't know, not in a
very museum benefity kind of mood.

17:15.489 --> 17:19.482
Right. Well, okay. Okay.
God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

17:19.693 --> 17:21.888
- That's fine.
- No, but you're mad.

17:22.163 --> 17:24.097
I'm not mad. I'm just not going.

17:24.298 --> 17:25.788
- Right.
- Okay.

17:27.101 --> 17:30.161
You know that I have to go, right?

17:30.404 --> 17:34.841
So is it gonna be, like,
I'm abandoning you while you're upset?

17:35.009 --> 17:35.998
- No.
- No?

17:36.243 --> 17:40.373
- You're not upset about the yelling.
- Right. And the humiliating.

17:40.548 --> 17:42.675
Well, of course, the humiliating.

17:44.718 --> 17:45.742
So we...

17:46.353 --> 17:47.479
...we're okay?

17:47.721 --> 17:49.712
- We're good.
- Right.

17:53.127 --> 17:55.357
- Honey? I love you.
- Yes, Ross.

17:56.830 --> 17:58.695
Get away from the phone!

18:01.268 --> 18:03.259
She's just getting dressed now.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.739
Is it wrong that I was
totally aroused by that?

18:17.785 --> 18:20.185
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

18:20.588 --> 18:24.422
You hide my clothes,
I'm wearing everything you own.

18:24.925 --> 18:26.552
Oh, my God!

18:28.195 --> 18:31.995
That is so not the opposite
of taking somebody's underwear!

18:32.166 --> 18:33.724
Look at me! I'm Chandler.

18:33.934 --> 18:36.869
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

18:38.405 --> 18:40.896
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...

18:45.913 --> 18:48.177
It's hot with all this stuff on.

18:48.415 --> 18:50.975
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

18:53.721 --> 18:56.087
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.

18:56.323 --> 18:58.951
I'm sick of this.
I've had it up to here.

18:59.193 --> 19:01.684
Neither of you can come to the party!

19:02.196 --> 19:03.857
Jeez, what a baby!

19:04.765 --> 19:07.598
Way to ruin it.
I was gonna go get dressed.

19:07.768 --> 19:10.066
The only person
I cared about getting dressed...

19:10.304 --> 19:12.738
...is the person who's
not even gonna go.

19:12.973 --> 19:14.838
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?

19:15.109 --> 19:19.603
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.680
I need you there.

19:22.583 --> 19:26.519
What can I do to show you
how much I want you to be there?

19:27.521 --> 19:29.421
You could drink the fat.

19:31.992 --> 19:34.620
Welcome to an adult conversation.

19:35.029 --> 19:37.327
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

19:37.598 --> 19:41.432
- That actually sounds interesting.
- What?

19:41.602 --> 19:43.866
I think you should drink the fat.

19:50.044 --> 19:54.344
Okay, if that's what it takes to
show you how much you mean to me...

19:54.515 --> 19:57.211
...and how much I want you there,
that's what I'll do.

19:57.384 --> 20:00.649
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.

20:01.155 --> 20:03.419
I think this will be fine.

20:03.891 --> 20:06.985
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake...

20:07.261 --> 20:10.059
...with chicken bits floating in it.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.790
Cheers.

20:14.968 --> 20:17.402
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.

20:17.671 --> 20:18.797
You will?

20:19.907 --> 20:22.933
- You were really gonna do that.
- Well, yeah.

20:24.011 --> 20:26.172
You were gonna drink the fat.

20:29.717 --> 20:32.208
Let's see what else he'll do!

20:33.587 --> 20:36.420
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.

20:36.623 --> 20:39.922
I'll get a cab. I want everyone
downstairs in two minutes.

20:40.127 --> 20:41.253
Monica!

20:41.929 --> 20:44.227
Stop it. Stop it!

20:48.702 --> 20:50.363
Ross went to get a cab, so we...

20:50.604 --> 20:53.232
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

20:56.543 --> 20:58.010
Hi, this is Richard.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.405
You have three new messages.

21:03.450 --> 21:05.008
Not anymore.

21:05.719 --> 21:07.846
Message erased.

21:09.456 --> 21:13.790
To record your message,
begin speaking at the tone.

21:14.928 --> 21:16.919
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

21:17.164 --> 21:20.133
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

21:20.334 --> 21:23.269
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

21:23.937 --> 21:29.341
I beeped into your machine and I heard
this message that freaked me out...

21:29.510 --> 21:32.809
You know what?
Michelle will tell you the rest.

21:32.980 --> 21:37.542
I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we
can just forget the whole thing.

21:40.354 --> 21:44.085
Your outgoing message
has now been changed.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.114
Outgoing?

21:46.360 --> 21:49.261
Did that say outgoing?
Not outgoing!

21:52.466 --> 21:54.366
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

21:54.635 --> 21:57.661
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.466
Maybe I'm getting
my period or something.

22:00.641 --> 22:03.132
- How did you do that?
- I don't know!

22:03.377 --> 22:05.811
- Goodbye.
- No!

22:07.481 --> 22:12.817
Okay. Okay. Okay, I've got two
cabs and no people! Go, go, go!

22:12.986 --> 22:16.149
Maybe we can call the phone company
to change the message?

22:16.390 --> 22:17.687
They could change his number.

22:17.891 --> 22:21.554
I think after this,
he'll be doing that himself.

22:22.930 --> 22:23.954
Rachel!

22:29.870 --> 22:32.498
You...
You look...

22:35.008 --> 22:38.136
And I still have about
five seconds to spare.

22:44.151 --> 22:47.814
- That was about seven seconds.
- So we're a little late.

22:47.988 --> 22:49.717
Come on.

22:50.724 --> 22:53.659
- Oh, and by the way...
- What?

22:54.428 --> 22:56.828
I'm going commando too.

23:06.406 --> 23:10.103
So I said, "Who are you
Cro-Magnum P. I?"

23:12.212 --> 23:13.304
Dr. Geller?

23:14.448 --> 23:18.214
- Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
- What a pleasure.

23:18.385 --> 23:23.015
I was quite impressed with your
paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.750
Yes. It confirmed everything
I'd written.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.188
Excuse me.

23:27.361 --> 23:28.555
Hi.

23:28.729 --> 23:30.060
Yes?

23:30.230 --> 23:33.222
Well, you're kind of sitting in my seat.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.094
What do you mean, your seat?

23:35.602 --> 23:38.503
- I mean, I was sitting there.
- But you got up.

23:38.739 --> 23:40.900
But I never left the room.

23:41.608 --> 23:43.974
But you left the chair area.

23:45.479 --> 23:47.606
That's it.
Give me your underwear.

23:51.285 --> 23:52.274
