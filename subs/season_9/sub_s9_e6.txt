00:11.991 --> 00:13.357
Hello.

00:16.432 --> 00:17.765
Hello.

00:18.236 --> 00:19.535
I love my new job!

00:19.940 --> 00:22.537
- Honey, you're screaming.
- You bet your ass I am!

00:22.746 --> 00:24.682
I just had the best first day ever!

00:24.850 --> 00:27.013
The kitchen?
Twice as big as Allessandro's.

00:27.354 --> 00:29.017
Oh, that's great.

00:29.392 --> 00:33.492
And clean? Not just health
department-clean, Monica-clean!

00:34.201 --> 00:35.260
Awesome.

00:35.638 --> 00:38.006
Oh, and the people are so nice.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.270
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,
he's the maitre d'.

00:40.648 --> 00:42.584
Chandler, you will love him!

00:42.786 --> 00:46.783
He is without a doubt
the funniest guy I have ever met!

01:39.700 --> 01:42.398
- This is nice.
- I know.

01:51.489 --> 01:54.290
- You need both hands for that?
- Yeah, I kind of do.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.489
Well, how's this?

02:07.154 --> 02:09.488
Are you sure that's sweet enough?

02:13.601 --> 02:17.199
Look at you two holding hands.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.276
Is this getting serious?

02:21.282 --> 02:23.275
Have you not talked about it yet?

02:25.123 --> 02:27.025
Am I making you uncomfortable?

02:29.131 --> 02:31.192
If you were bigger you'd hit me.

02:36.245 --> 02:37.338
I'm sorry.

02:37.515 --> 02:41.420
It's obviously way too early
for us to be having that conversation.

02:41.824 --> 02:43.760
- Is it?
- Maybe not. Is it?

02:44.996 --> 02:46.021
When I got divorced..

02:46.199 --> 02:49.330
I didn't think I'd feel this way about
someone for a really long time.

02:49.506 --> 02:52.341
Then again, I didn't think I'd meet
someone like you. And..

02:52.512 --> 02:56.577
This may be crazy-soon,
but I want you to have this.

02:58.156 --> 03:00.023
No, not.. That's gum.

03:02.397 --> 03:05.564
Oh, five bucks!
I love it when that happens, you know?

03:05.738 --> 03:07.799
- You don't know it's there..
- I know. Keep digging.

03:08.209 --> 03:09.302
Sorry.

03:13.888 --> 03:14.913
It's a key.

03:15.090 --> 03:18.460
To be honest, I think I'd prefer
the five dollars.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.067
- It's to my apartment.
- Wow!

03:23.206 --> 03:24.732
Big step for Phoebe and Mike.

03:24.910 --> 03:28.110
I don't want you to feel like you
have to give me your key..

03:28.483 --> 03:31.011
- No, I want to.
- Thank God.

03:33.493 --> 03:37.126
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that..

03:37.301 --> 03:39.100
I wanted to do this with.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.669
Here you go.

03:43.313 --> 03:45.546
- This is cool.
- It really is.

03:45.952 --> 03:51.452
I know it. It is amazing.
These little things open doors!

03:55.504 --> 03:57.565
So I don't go back to work
for another four weeks..

03:57.775 --> 03:59.711
but we would like our nanny
to start right away..

03:59.879 --> 04:01.644
so that Emma could get
a chance to know her.

04:02.017 --> 04:03.987
I think that's really smart.

04:04.154 --> 04:06.523
The easier we can make the
transition for her the better.

04:06.693 --> 04:07.718
That's great. Great.

04:07.895 --> 04:10.263
- So do you have any questions for us?
- Not really.

04:10.433 --> 04:12.768
All right. Well, thank you
so much for coming.

04:12.939 --> 04:15.536
- Thank you.
- It was really nice to meet you.

04:15.711 --> 04:18.204
- We will call you.
- Oh, you know, wait.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.080
I do have one question.

04:20.253 --> 04:23.225
Do you guys do random drug testing?

04:25.531 --> 04:28.229
Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.

04:28.403 --> 04:32.366
That's cool. But if you do,
I'm gonna need three days' notice.

04:32.745 --> 04:33.974
Okey-dokey!

04:35.718 --> 04:37.243
We're never gonna find a nanny.

04:37.421 --> 04:40.952
Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.
We have more interviews.

04:41.128 --> 04:45.262
Worse comes to worst, we can always
reconsider the first one we met with.

04:45.638 --> 04:49.236
- What, the blond with no bra?
- She was blond?

04:51.817 --> 04:52.876
Just a sec.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.655
Okay, this one's name is Sandy.

04:55.825 --> 04:59.663
She's got a degree in
Early Childhood Education.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.334
She worked for her last family
for three years.

05:06.613 --> 05:09.551
Hi. I'm Sandy.

05:12.925 --> 05:15.452
And she's a little mannish.

05:22.879 --> 05:24.542
Oh, my God! David!

05:26.051 --> 05:30.014
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's a great time! Come in!

05:30.226 --> 05:32.321
Wow! Hi!

05:32.497 --> 05:36.062
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?

05:36.238 --> 05:37.537
Just for a couple of days.

05:37.909 --> 05:40.277
I'm here to explain to the people
who gave us our grant..

05:40.480 --> 05:43.783
why it's a positive thing that
we've spent all their money..

05:43.987 --> 05:46.720
and accomplished nothing.

05:47.394 --> 05:49.227
Who cares? It got you here.

05:49.398 --> 05:52.565
It got me to New York.
Then I got in a cab at the airport..

05:52.738 --> 05:54.400
and the guy said, "Where to?"

05:54.576 --> 05:58.379
I just gave him your address.
I didn't even think about it.

06:00.554 --> 06:01.886
Where's your luggage?

06:03.894 --> 06:05.328
Damn it.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.926
All right, I'll call the cab company.

06:09.204 --> 06:13.235
We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?

06:15.718 --> 06:16.879
Boy.

06:17.053 --> 06:19.889
There's an old Russian expression
that goes:

06:24.067 --> 06:26.060
Roughly translated, that means:

06:26.238 --> 06:29.507
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."

06:31.716 --> 06:33.048
Thank you.

06:33.219 --> 06:36.784
You should see me when..
Actually, no, I look pretty good.

06:37.862 --> 06:39.387
Are you kidding?

06:39.565 --> 06:42.229
You know, when you don't see
someone for a long time..

06:42.404 --> 06:44.875
you build them up in your head,
you start thinking:

06:45.043 --> 06:47.776
"Come on, don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautiful."

06:47.948 --> 06:50.441
But, well, you are.

06:52.390 --> 06:55.419
Well, so are you seeing anyone?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.491
No.

06:59.972 --> 07:02.238
I'm just the worst person ever!

07:02.611 --> 07:04.979
How can I not tell David
that I'm seeing Mike?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.776
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.422
He said, "Are you seeing someone?"
and I said, "No."

07:11.663 --> 07:14.361
Well, that would've been your window.

07:14.869 --> 07:18.308
I mean, I don't know.
I was looking in his eyes..

07:18.476 --> 07:22.041
and I was just thinking,
"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."

07:22.250 --> 07:24.653
He's so irresistible.

07:25.022 --> 07:28.153
- Really? The scientist guy?
- Really? Chandler?

07:34.575 --> 07:36.339
Continue.

07:37.648 --> 07:38.673
Then it gets worse..

07:38.850 --> 07:40.911
because I told him
I would see him tomorrow night.

07:41.321 --> 07:44.556
- Phoebe!
- I know! Evil!

07:46.833 --> 07:52.242
I like Mike so much, you know?
It's just going really well. Oh, my God!

07:52.745 --> 07:54.772
Isn't it ironic that David
would show up..

07:54.949 --> 07:57.442
on the same day that
you and Mike exchange keys?

08:00.126 --> 08:03.360
Yeah. You know, and given
my lifelong search for irony..

08:03.533 --> 08:05.560
you can imagine how happy I am!

08:07.641 --> 08:11.136
- What are you gonna do?
- I mean, I guess I just have to..

08:11.348 --> 08:14.844
tell David that nothing
can happen between us.

08:15.089 --> 08:17.286
Unless I don't.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.453
You know, complicated moral situation?

08:19.632 --> 08:22.296
- No right, no wrong?
- You have to tell David.

08:22.505 --> 08:26.274
I knew I should've had this conversation
with Joey.

08:28.817 --> 08:31.447
Funniest guy she's ever met.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.684
I'm funny, right?

08:34.094 --> 08:36.428
What do you know? You're a door.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.331
You just like knock-knock jokes.

08:41.976 --> 08:44.446
Save it for inside.

08:47.555 --> 08:52.223
So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,
they call it the Sooner State.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.867
Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state!

08:57.006 --> 08:59.476
And what's with Oklahoma
having a panhandle?

08:59.645 --> 09:01.341
Can all states have stuff like that?

09:01.516 --> 09:04.886
Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistband
of Wyoming.

09:05.089 --> 09:09.154
But when I was 7,
we headed over to the crotch.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.499
Was your cabin pressurized?

09:13.873 --> 09:16.902
And don't get me started on the way
the people from Tulsa talk.

09:17.715 --> 09:18.876
Okay.

09:20.019 --> 09:24.927
What's with the word "y'all"? You know,
just two words just pushed together?

09:25.096 --> 09:28.797
Are we all allowed to do that?
Because if so, I say why stop there?

09:29.004 --> 09:32.204
You know, your new poodle
could be your noodle.

09:32.443 --> 09:35.074
And fried chicken could be fricken.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.152
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,
I'll have the fricken!

09:41.261 --> 09:43.630
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?

09:43.800 --> 09:47.672
No, it just reminds me of something
this guy did today at work.

09:47.841 --> 09:49.834
I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,
right?

09:50.312 --> 09:51.941
Yeah, he came up.

09:52.818 --> 09:57.122
Well, he did this bit.
You probably had to be there..

09:57.293 --> 10:01.962
but it was Liza Minnelli locked
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.

10:06.879 --> 10:10.318
- Were you there?
- No, but it sounds fricken funny.

10:13.292 --> 10:17.289
I really understand how hard it's gotta be
to leave your child with another person.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.736
I mean, it's like leaving behind
a piece of your heart.

10:21.509 --> 10:25.107
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.

10:26.519 --> 10:28.420
Are you gay?

10:30.527 --> 10:35.902
I'm sorry, that's our Ross.
He's just Mr. Shoot Straight From The Hip.

10:38.777 --> 10:40.872
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.

10:41.081 --> 10:43.381
But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.

10:43.987 --> 10:46.686
- Her name's Delia.
- That's pretty.

10:48.395 --> 10:52.734
So you're just, like,
a guy who's a nanny.

10:54.909 --> 10:58.245
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox
for some people.

10:58.415 --> 11:02.446
But I really believe the most satisfying
thing you can do with your life..

11:02.624 --> 11:04.115
is take care of a child.

11:04.562 --> 11:06.224
Okay.

11:08.903 --> 11:10.269
Like at my last job.

11:10.439 --> 11:12.569
I met Daniel when he was
3 weeks old.

11:12.744 --> 11:16.342
And I got to watch him grow
into this awesome person.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.649
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."

11:19.825 --> 11:22.854
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"

11:24.702 --> 11:26.934
That was his name for me.

11:27.473 --> 11:32.142
"I'll see you every day right in.."

11:38.028 --> 11:41.991
- It's okay.
- Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

11:46.478 --> 11:48.711
Oh, God, she must need
her diaper changed.

11:48.883 --> 11:53.621
- I can take care of that, if you want.
- That would be great.

11:55.764 --> 12:00.296
Just so you know, these dinosaur toys
aren't really age-appropriate.

12:00.472 --> 12:02.169
They're mine.

12:05.884 --> 12:08.583
Also not age-appropriate.

12:10.927 --> 12:14.058
I love him, I love him, I love him!

12:14.233 --> 12:16.396
Come on. Rach, he's a guy!

12:16.572 --> 12:18.667
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.

12:18.843 --> 12:21.006
Give me one good reason
we shouldn't try him out.

12:21.381 --> 12:24.684
Because it's weird!

12:25.189 --> 12:26.316
Why?

12:30.834 --> 12:34.501
Wow, I never looked at it that way.

12:35.810 --> 12:38.246
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?

12:38.816 --> 12:41.515
I mean, it's like if a woman
wanted to be..

12:41.689 --> 12:42.987
Yes?

12:44.895 --> 12:46.728
King?

12:48.636 --> 12:52.166
I hope you don't mind. I used
some of my homemade lotion on Emma.

12:52.343 --> 12:56.443
It's a mixture of calendula and
honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.749
Plus, it keeps the hands young.

13:06.572 --> 13:08.701
Yes! Sandy, you're hired!

13:09.077 --> 13:10.944
That's great!

13:14.822 --> 13:15.915
I'm sorry.

13:16.091 --> 13:19.553
It's just such an emotional thing
when you're welcomed into a new family.

13:19.898 --> 13:21.059
Oh, God. Come here.

13:25.109 --> 13:27.102
You gotta be at least bi.

13:44.147 --> 13:45.810
I need you to set me up for a joke.

13:45.984 --> 13:48.454
When Monica's around,
ask me about fire trucks.

13:49.525 --> 13:53.625
I don't know, Chandler. I'm not
so good with remembering lines.

13:56.037 --> 13:58.565
Thank God your livelihood
doesn't depend on it.

13:58.743 --> 14:00.576
I know, right?

14:01.715 --> 14:03.081
Why are we doing this?

14:03.485 --> 14:06.890
Monica says that her maitre d' is
the funniest guy she's ever met.

14:07.059 --> 14:11.056
- Seriously? She actually said that?
- Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

14:11.367 --> 14:14.203
- No! Being funny's your thing!
- Yeah!

14:14.541 --> 14:17.980
Without that, you just got
"lame with women"!

14:18.916 --> 14:20.077
Hi! There you are.

14:20.252 --> 14:21.516
Fire trucks!

14:33.679 --> 14:35.341
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.380
I brought you this from Minsk.

14:38.556 --> 14:43.794
You're not gonna belief this.
This is lemon-flavored vodka.

14:45.068 --> 14:47.334
Yeah, we actually have this here.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.442
I traded four pairs of Levi's for that.

14:52.216 --> 14:54.311
Thanks anyway.

14:56.625 --> 15:00.725
Wow. You look even more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

15:02.704 --> 15:05.004
In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.

15:05.610 --> 15:08.103
- Wait, wait.
- I can't get away with stuff like that.

15:08.281 --> 15:11.276
It sounded sexy in my head, so I..

15:11.655 --> 15:13.648
No, no, it's not that.

15:15.295 --> 15:19.099
Remember when you asked me if
I was seeing someone and I said no?

15:19.270 --> 15:22.299
Well, I am. His name's Mike.

15:26.084 --> 15:29.147
- I should've told you.
- No.

15:29.925 --> 15:31.952
Well, yeah.

15:32.530 --> 15:37.233
I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,
but then I just got lost in your eyes..

15:37.406 --> 15:40.310
and I just forgot all about..

15:41.515 --> 15:43.712
- Mike?
- Right, yes.

15:44.588 --> 15:50.498
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Well, it's okay. I understand.

15:51.668 --> 15:53.466
Well, are you happy with this guy?

15:53.773 --> 15:55.743
- I am happy.
- Damn it.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.381
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
I want you to be happy.

15:59.551 --> 16:02.853
But only with me. No, that's not fair.
Who cares. Leave him.

16:03.024 --> 16:06.258
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.800
I think I should probably go.

16:11.240 --> 16:15.044
But, David, I just want you to know that,
you know..

16:15.282 --> 16:19.781
telling you this is one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do.

16:20.793 --> 16:22.729
Well, just so you know..

16:22.897 --> 16:26.028
hearing it wasn't exactly
a Vladnik carnival, either.

16:28.107 --> 16:32.549
- Can we at least hug goodbye?
- Of course. Yeah.

16:39.865 --> 16:43.600
You know, and a kiss on the cheek
wouldn't be totally inappropriate.

16:43.772 --> 16:46.573
- No. No.
- I mean..

16:49.618 --> 16:50.950
- In Minsk?
- Yeah?

16:51.120 --> 16:53.717
It's two on each cheek..

16:53.893 --> 16:58.858
- and one on the lips.
- Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.

17:04.413 --> 17:06.748
In New York, it's..

17:15.503 --> 17:17.028
Oh, boy.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.940
Is everything all right?

17:23.351 --> 17:25.344
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.

17:25.523 --> 17:29.360
Sandy was just telling me about how he
proposed to his fiancee..

17:29.731 --> 17:31.393
and it was so beautiful.

17:31.768 --> 17:34.797
Her favorite flower is the camellia.
From the poem..

17:35.208 --> 17:37.201
I can't hear it again!

17:37.379 --> 17:39.748
You know, I can't tell it again!

17:40.285 --> 17:42.278
And I'm fine never having heard it.

17:44.426 --> 17:49.130
- Rach, can I see you for a sec?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

17:52.242 --> 17:57.480
Do you realize that man has cried
in our apartment three times?

17:57.954 --> 18:00.983
I haven't cried that many times
since I moved in!

18:01.494 --> 18:06.961
Come on, Ross, you got a little misty
when Ben broke your I-heart-fossils mug.

18:07.707 --> 18:11.738
I'll have you know that was a farewell gift
from my colleagues at the museum.

18:11.915 --> 18:16.322
- Okay? They all chipped in for that.
- They must have all loved you very much.

18:17.527 --> 18:20.693
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.

18:20.900 --> 18:25.307
Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.

18:25.676 --> 18:27.440
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

18:27.780 --> 18:31.811
No, I mean, that guy..
These are amazing!

18:32.055 --> 18:34.025
Sandy made madeleines.

18:34.359 --> 18:37.490
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

18:39.136 --> 18:43.201
What kind of a guy makes delicate
French cookies?

18:43.377 --> 18:46.839
They're not even butch,
manly cookies with..

18:47.018 --> 18:50.583
You know, with chunks!

18:53.699 --> 18:56.431
Well, you know,
I don't know what to say.

18:56.605 --> 19:00.545
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.

19:00.713 --> 19:06.384
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you
just came in from branding cattle.

19:09.564 --> 19:13.435
Hey, there's sensitive and
there's too sensitive.

19:13.806 --> 19:16.505
Okay, what is too sensitive?

19:41.661 --> 19:44.325
No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.

19:44.934 --> 19:49.272
But it's nice. And nice is good.

19:49.443 --> 19:53.008
And good is not bad.
Ergo, we should keep kissing.

19:53.384 --> 19:55.719
- No, no. No.
- But..

19:56.658 --> 19:58.320
Ergo.

19:59.797 --> 20:02.735
Look, David, if you had never left, then..

20:02.904 --> 20:05.671
yeah, we'd probably still be together
right now.

20:05.843 --> 20:12.311
But you did leave. And I'm with Mike
and I really care about him.

20:13.457 --> 20:14.858
Okay.

20:15.328 --> 20:17.526
Well, he's very lucky.

20:18.167 --> 20:19.534
Thank you.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.332
Goodbye.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.227
The key works.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.128
Hi, Mike.

20:36.972 --> 20:40.969
And, you, thanks for the face massage!
Thank you!

20:43.317 --> 20:46.654
Did Rachel tell you we hired
a male nanny?

20:47.025 --> 20:48.323
I think that's great!

20:48.695 --> 20:54.161
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,
recites poetry and bakes madeleines?

20:56.745 --> 21:01.653
- How are they?
- Lighter than air, but that's not the point.

21:04.092 --> 21:06.358
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.767
Really?

21:08.969 --> 21:11.030
Guys do that?

21:11.206 --> 21:13.677
- That's weird.
- Thank you!

21:14.046 --> 21:16.073
- That's like a woman wanting to be..
- What?

21:16.250 --> 21:19.849
- What's the end of that sentence?
- Yes. What is the end of that sentence?

21:23.097 --> 21:24.930
A penis model!

21:30.646 --> 21:33.446
Anyway, did you tell Chandler
that some guy from work..

21:33.618 --> 21:35.520
is the funniest guy you ever met?

21:35.789 --> 21:38.818
- Yeah. So?
- Wow!

21:39.597 --> 21:41.965
Really? Do you not know Chandler?

21:43.638 --> 21:48.409
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jealous?

21:48.582 --> 21:49.743
Oh, my God, that is crazy.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.319
- It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.
- So what?

21:52.489 --> 21:57.363
Being funny is Chandler's thing.
Like Ross' thing is..

22:02.108 --> 22:04.169
Science?

22:04.446 --> 22:07.851
Academia? Being a good father?

22:12.095 --> 22:14.566
- I can't believe he's that upset.
- Are you kidding?

22:14.734 --> 22:19.334
That's like Chandler saying he met someone
who was more uptight than you.

22:21.180 --> 22:25.314
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. Sorry. More controlling than you.

22:26.791 --> 22:28.886
- Well, that's better.
- Yeah, okay.

22:29.062 --> 22:31.396
You have to do some damage control.

22:31.568 --> 22:34.004
Because he's feeling like..

22:35.976 --> 22:38.071
What are you guys talking about?

22:39.015 --> 22:42.716
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

22:43.157 --> 22:46.288
You got a man who's a nanny?

22:46.463 --> 22:47.762
You got a "manny"?

22:57.452 --> 22:59.445
You know, I don't mind a male nanny..

22:59.624 --> 23:01.456
but I do draw the line
at male wet nurse.

23:07.171 --> 23:09.300
You are on a roll, mister!

23:10.144 --> 23:13.082
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I would've brought more pizza.

23:15.421 --> 23:19.556
Okay! Okay! Stop it, you!
You stop it!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.801
What is so funny about that?

23:28.815 --> 23:30.215
Monica?

23:31.119 --> 23:34.455
I don't know, it's..
Just the way you say it.

23:34.627 --> 23:38.590
I mean, you're funny. You have
that funny thing. You're a funny guy!

23:42.008 --> 23:44.775
Did you tell her what we talked about?

23:53.865 --> 23:57.669
So those were pity laughs?
Pity laughs?!

23:58.374 --> 24:00.709
Honey, listen.

24:01.079 --> 24:03.140
You have nothing to worry about
with Jeffrey.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.446
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?

24:05.822 --> 24:08.315
Well, you're different funny.

24:08.494 --> 24:10.829
I mean, you're more sarcastic.

24:10.999 --> 24:14.564
Well, he does bits and impressions
and limericks.

24:14.974 --> 24:15.999
I do limericks.

24:16.677 --> 24:21.676
There once was a man named Chandler
whose wife made him die inside.

24:23.123 --> 24:25.856
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.931
You know that joke
you told me last week?

24:28.100 --> 24:31.004
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girl with the lazy eye.

24:31.306 --> 24:32.741
That slayed me.

24:33.210 --> 24:37.310
Hey! I made up that joke
and told it to you.

24:41.059 --> 24:45.432
- Not knowing when to shut up.
- Yep, that's my thing.

24:48.273 --> 24:51.576
So how many guys have your key?

24:52.716 --> 24:54.652
It's not as bad as it looks.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.887
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

24:57.258 --> 24:59.251
Your lipstick's on his mouth.

25:00.197 --> 25:03.169
We just happen to wear the same shade.

25:04.472 --> 25:07.604
No, David and I did used to go out.

25:07.980 --> 25:12.922
But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.287
- Did you..?
- No. No.

25:15.461 --> 25:17.124
- Kiss him?
- Oh, well, yeah.

25:18.768 --> 25:21.899
Yes, but..
Look, she really likes you.

25:22.074 --> 25:25.342
In fact, she stopped
what was a pretty amazing kiss.

25:25.515 --> 25:29.045
- David, David, David.
- No, no. He should hear this.

25:29.222 --> 25:32.662
I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are, fella.

25:32.896 --> 25:35.230
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Why?

25:35.401 --> 25:36.961
What are you gonna do about it?

25:37.371 --> 25:40.070
Well, I'll show you
what I'm gonna do about it.

25:40.244 --> 25:42.738
- Oh, really? Really?
- You want some of that?

25:46.624 --> 25:49.755
Stop it! Stop it!
Before someone gets really hurt!

25:52.468 --> 25:54.939
Here, David, you should just go.

25:55.107 --> 25:56.405
All right.

25:57.646 --> 26:02.349
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,
well, you just better watch out.

26:02.723 --> 26:05.786
- If I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
- Oh, you're going to Minsk?

26:05.996 --> 26:08.832
- Well, I might.
- Really?

26:09.002 --> 26:12.338
Well, if you do, come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.

26:13.010 --> 26:14.570
I've heard that, actually.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.183
Okay, well, guys?

26:18.521 --> 26:20.114
- Goodbye, Phoebe.
- Bye.

26:20.357 --> 26:23.888
- Hey, what, are you kidding me?
- Right-o. Right-o.

26:27.606 --> 26:29.542
Take good care of her.

26:32.381 --> 26:34.545
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.056
If you want your key back,
I totally understand.

26:39.630 --> 26:42.727
- It's never gonna happen again, right?
- Right. Never. I swear.

26:46.544 --> 26:50.609
I just want to say, if you do ever
come to Minsk, that's my number.

26:50.785 --> 26:54.246
We'll party up Vladnik-style.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.784
Yeah! All right!

27:12.161 --> 27:16.363
Hey, Ross! Check it out!
Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns"!

27:16.971 --> 27:19.498
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."

27:19.877 --> 27:22.644
- "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.
- I swear to God.

27:26.389 --> 27:30.056
- Who's up for puppets?
- Me! I'm up for puppets!

27:30.230 --> 27:33.066
Well, please welcome:

27:33.236 --> 27:35.206
The Snufflebumps!

27:35.374 --> 27:39.041
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch and
who's gonna be the Grumpus?

27:39.215 --> 27:44.419
How exactly is a 2-month-old
supposed to appreciate puppets?

27:44.793 --> 27:48.927
Studies show that the movement and
colors help their cerebral development.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.666
The whimsical characters are just for us.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.620
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch!

28:00.792 --> 28:02.055
Oh, my God.

28:02.294 --> 28:04.993
Well, I guess we know who's
gonna be the Grumpus!

28:10.578 --> 28:13.140
- That was kind of rude.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

28:13.316 --> 28:17.347
Please apologize to Sandy
and the Snufflebumps for me.

28:17.959 --> 28:20.863
- You know, he was just doing his job.
- You know what?

28:21.032 --> 28:27.273
I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't
in love with Gary Poppins out there.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.312
But I just.. I can't go through with this.

28:32.689 --> 28:34.157
- Come on.
- No! You know what?

28:34.392 --> 28:39.357
I would never force you to hire someone
you were this uncomfortable with.

28:42.976 --> 28:44.912
That's true.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.275
Thank you.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.851
You want to fire him,
so you have to go do it.

28:52.161 --> 28:57.537
So you see, Wigglemunch,
that's why it's important to share.

28:59.876 --> 29:03.178
I am learning so much from you.

29:08.093 --> 29:09.356
Well, I'm off to Tulsa.

29:09.730 --> 29:12.964
So if your maitre d' friend
has any funny Oklahoma jokes..

29:13.136 --> 29:17.908
tell him to e-mail me at
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com!

29:20.117 --> 29:21.711
Honey, you can relax.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.290
Last night at work Jeffrey
told this really sexist joke.

29:25.460 --> 29:28.398
- After that, not so funny anymore.
- Really?

29:28.768 --> 29:32.400
See, that's the thing.
You gotta keep it smart, people!

29:33.644 --> 29:35.910
Don't miss that flight.
You know I love you.

29:36.282 --> 29:38.445
I love you too.

29:38.654 --> 29:42.423
- And I like you as a friend.
- Right.

29:42.595 --> 29:45.122
- See you later.
- See you.

29:46.703 --> 29:50.198
- Did the guy really make that joke?
- No, he still kills me.

29:50.410 --> 29:54.681
Last night he had me laughing so hard,
I swear a little pee came out.

30:03.036 --> 30:04.197
Here goes.

30:04.438 --> 30:07.707
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

30:12.354 --> 30:13.755
Sandy? Hi.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.689
- Hi.
- We..

30:15.862 --> 30:17.889
We kind of need to talk.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.207
I'm afraid it's not working out.

30:29.355 --> 30:34.388
I mean, Rachel and I think you are great
with Emma.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.800
- We just feel..
- You! You feel!

30:38.707 --> 30:43.205
I just feel..

30:43.383 --> 30:46.754
that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.

30:46.924 --> 30:49.589
We're more than happy to give you
a good recommendation.

30:49.963 --> 30:54.165
No, that's okay. I had a lot of offers
from other families.

30:54.338 --> 30:56.639
I just picked you guys because..

30:56.810 --> 31:00.910
- I liked you the best.
- Oh, damn you, Geller!

31:04.158 --> 31:07.153
Anyway, well I'm glad
there's no hard feelings.

31:07.565 --> 31:12.199
None at all. You need to be happy
with whoever is in your home.

31:12.441 --> 31:15.972
Although, if you don't mind telling me..

31:16.148 --> 31:19.610
what was the problem? Maybe it's
something I can work on in the future.

31:20.323 --> 31:25.961
No, you know, it's nothing you did.
It's my issue.

31:27.104 --> 31:28.664
What is it?

31:31.145 --> 31:32.739
Please?

31:36.355 --> 31:42.824
You know, I'm just not that comfortable
with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

31:43.871 --> 31:44.896
That's fair.

31:45.941 --> 31:49.574
Although, can I ask,
why do you think that is?

31:50.216 --> 31:52.049
Why? I don't know.

31:59.769 --> 32:02.296
Maybe because of my father?

32:06.683 --> 32:09.176
You know, when I was growing up,
he was a tough guy.

32:10.624 --> 32:15.292
You know, and as a kid,
I wasn't the athlete I am now.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.403
I play squash!

32:22.982 --> 32:28.585
Anyway, I always got the feeling
he thought I was too sensitive.

32:29.094 --> 32:30.426
That must have been hard.

32:31.967 --> 32:33.994
It was hard.

32:35.273 --> 32:40.477
I remember I was in my bedroom,
playing with my dinosaurs..

32:41.553 --> 32:42.885
Playing and learning.

32:45.561 --> 32:51.402
And my father walks in and says,
"What are you doing with those things?

32:51.640 --> 32:57.551
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you
outside playing like a real boy?"

32:57.985 --> 33:01.151
- But you are a real boy.
- I know I am!

33:03.429 --> 33:08.566
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?!

33:09.943 --> 33:16.184
It's all right. Crying is good.
It lets the boo-hoos out.

33:18.861 --> 33:21.024
Here comes some more!

33:26.175 --> 33:32.678
Emma, one day you're gonna grow up
and be a big girl, just like your daddy.

33:37.932 --> 33:41.166
And what's the one kind of boat
that can never ever sink?

33:41.540 --> 33:46.345
- What kind?
- A friend ship!

33:48.252 --> 33:51.555
Wow! You blow my mind!

33:53.530 --> 33:55.557
I gotta go.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.533
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty bucks.

33:58.172 --> 34:01.406
It's like the cheapest college ever!

34:01.580 --> 34:04.244
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, bye-bye, Skadandy.
