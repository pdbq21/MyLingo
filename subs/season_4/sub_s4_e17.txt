WEBVTT

00:06.873 --> 00:09.034
Oh, man!

00:10.810 --> 00:13.540
-What's that?
-Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.973
What in the name of hell?

00:19.719 --> 00:21.983
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.685
Is this porn?

00:29.496 --> 00:31.760
I must have hit something
on the remote.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.590
Do we pay for this?

00:34.834 --> 00:37.166
We didn't even pay our cable bill.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.668
Maybe this is how they punish us.

00:40.273 --> 00:43.572
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

00:43.843 --> 00:47.074
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

00:49.115 --> 00:52.414
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.286
Joey pressed something on the remote
and it just came on.

00:59.092 --> 01:03.085
It happened to me once.
It was like finding money.

01:03.296 --> 01:06.129
Finding money
with naked people on it!

01:06.866 --> 01:09.357
But I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

01:09.636 --> 01:12.002
I never got it back again.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.261
And I'm sad.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.809
Why would he turn off the TV?

01:22.015 --> 01:24.108
The One with the Free Porn

02:14.334 --> 02:18.703
Do we really have to watch this
while we eat?

02:20.173 --> 02:23.870
We don't know
what could make this go away.

02:24.377 --> 02:28.336
So no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.678
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

02:33.253 --> 02:37.656
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.387
I'm at least going to mute it.

02:45.732 --> 02:46.858
We still have porn.

02:51.504 --> 02:55.270
What are you doing?
That's too heavy. Give it here.

02:56.776 --> 02:57.834
Oh, God.

03:01.681 --> 03:06.380
I'm too pregnant for lugging
around a stupid massage table.

03:06.619 --> 03:09.053
I need a job with a smaller table.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.189
Or a job without a table.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.255
You mean, like a doctor?

03:14.594 --> 03:16.459
You're blocking the porn!

03:20.333 --> 03:24.064
That reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.745
Emily just went to the airport.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.447
Why didn't you take her?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.683
Her uncle had planned to do it.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.842
We said our goodbyes this morning.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.649
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.858
Hey, cheer up.
You'll see her again, right?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.727
I don't know.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.063
When I brought it up, she said...

03:58.271 --> 04:01.604
..."This is so fantastic.
Why talk about the future?

04:01.908 --> 04:06.971
-Let's enjoy"
-Don't do the accent. It really bums me out.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.076
Emily said I was pretty good.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.116
Well, that's someone
you should hang on to.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.277
You've got to see her again.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.780
-Why do you care?
-Because!

04:18.057 --> 04:19.922
You could live out my fantasy.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.517
You had fantasies about Emily?

04:24.030 --> 04:27.056
You know, the fantasy.

04:27.233 --> 04:31.636
Meet a foreigner, fall madly in love
and spend your lives together.

04:32.405 --> 04:36.239
Is that why you hung out
with that Ukrainian kid in school?

04:38.144 --> 04:42.706
Yeah, plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.339
Do you love her?

04:46.586 --> 04:48.747
We said it would only be two weeks.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.480
You love her.

04:53.192 --> 04:55.660
What is love, really?

04:56.262 --> 04:57.991
I knew you loved her!

04:58.264 --> 05:00.494
You go to the airport and tell her.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.669
You'll probably catch her at the gate.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.667
You'll call her name
and yell "l love you!"

05:06.973 --> 05:09.168
She'll say "l love you too!"

05:09.442 --> 05:12.605
Then you will have
the most amazing kiss.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.144
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.174
I am a good kisser.

05:19.485 --> 05:23.114
Then you two can sneak
into the cockpit.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.788
Things will start to heat up.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.587
And then a stewardess comes in....

05:31.331 --> 05:33.265
I've been watching too much porn.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.306
-ls that the heartbeat?
-That's it.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.532
Oh, my God!

05:42.709 --> 05:44.609
This is so cool!

05:45.445 --> 05:48.937
Have we talked about multiple births?

05:50.083 --> 05:54.850
Let's take care of this one. If l
get pregnant again, I have your card.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.951
No, I'm getting
three separate heartbeats.

06:00.426 --> 06:03.589
You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.022
Doctors are wrong all the time.

06:09.168 --> 06:11.466
Are you sure that there are three?

06:11.704 --> 06:14.195
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.

06:19.445 --> 06:24.508
So in a few months, I'll have three
babies walking around inside me?

06:26.152 --> 06:31.215
It'll be like one of those log rides
when they come shooting out.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.953
Giving birth to three
is like giving birth to one.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.495
What do you know?

06:39.165 --> 06:42.498
-Have you ever had triplets?
-No. I'm sorry, I haven't.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.761
I'm going to use this a lot.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.642
How'd it go at the doctor's?

06:58.751 --> 07:02.414
You know how, when you're
walking down the street...

07:02.655 --> 07:05.317
...and you see three people in a row.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.651
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

07:14.500 --> 07:17.492
Good news!
You'll have three babies.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.568
Three babies?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.744
I've finally got my band!

07:26.612 --> 07:31.106
We'll have a big family!
I always wanted a big family.

07:31.284 --> 07:36.153
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're happy!
I was afraid you'd be freaked.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.022
Why would we be freaked?

07:39.258 --> 07:43.558
Because it's harder to raise them
and the added expense.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.525
Right.

07:49.268 --> 07:52.260
No, back to happy.
Back to happy!

07:54.841 --> 07:57.708
It's going to be fine...

07:58.211 --> 08:00.509
...because I teach home ec.

08:00.713 --> 08:04.740
I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

08:04.917 --> 08:09.581
It'll be like my very own
little sweatshop.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.587
I was thinking, ever since
you said we'd have triplets.

08:18.364 --> 08:22.357
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.196
No, you can't quit college.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.835
You're in college?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.831
Refrigerator college.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.610
When we found out
we were having a baby...

08:34.847 --> 08:39.181
...I figured I should have
a career, you know?

08:39.385 --> 08:41.319
And I love refrigerators.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.946
You can't give up on your dream!

08:45.191 --> 08:48.991
No, it's okay.
We're going to have three kids.

08:49.228 --> 08:52.322
And that's a different kind of dream.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.362
Three kids and no money.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.067
This is the boarding call
for flight 009.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.072
What are you doing here?

09:09.382 --> 09:12.215
I had to see you
before you took off.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.412
You are so sweet.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.152
That's a big candy bar.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.393
I had the most amazing time with you.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.928
Me too.

09:28.467 --> 09:32.130
This is the final boarding call
for flight 009.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.038
Well, that's me.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.642
Here, have this.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.750
I'm only allowed
one piece of carry-on.

09:52.858 --> 09:56.259
Listen, I have to tell you something.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.425
I've been thinking.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.563
I'm just going to say it, okay?

10:03.002 --> 10:04.663
I think...

10:05.371 --> 10:06.998
...I love you.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.675
Thank you.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.052
It's no problem.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.065
What is that song?

10:41.240 --> 10:44.471
It's the theme
from Good Will Humping.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.010
You know who doesn't like
dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.

10:51.717 --> 10:52.979
Yeah, right.

10:54.787 --> 10:58.848
He said he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.686
Did he also say that
the dialogue was corny?

11:02.928 --> 11:07.058
-And that he found it funny, not sexy?
-Yes.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.326
Yeah, he likes porn.

11:12.938 --> 11:13.927
Where you going?

11:14.106 --> 11:17.598
To find out if he really
thinks models are too skinny.

11:20.746 --> 11:21.735
How'd it go?

11:22.048 --> 11:24.107
Frank has to quit college...

11:24.383 --> 11:27.819
...because his super-fertile
sister's having three babies.

11:28.087 --> 11:32.990
I need to make money fast.
I wanted to talk to you about an idea.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.093
You work for a big company.

11:35.294 --> 11:36.420
Insider trading.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.695
What information can you give me?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.434
They don't talk to us
about that stuff.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.728
But I can get you free White-Out.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.172
-Did you do what I said?
-I did.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.006
-What'd she say?
-"Thank you."

11:56.515 --> 11:59.507
You're totally welcome.
What'd she say?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.586
She said, "Thank you."

12:03.789 --> 12:06.189
I said, "l love you."

12:06.425 --> 12:09.417
And she said, "Thank you."

12:10.896 --> 12:13.228
That's not right.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.334
Did you say you love her?

12:16.502 --> 12:19.300
What were you trying
to get her to do?

12:21.140 --> 12:24.769
-What do I do now?
-You play hard-to-get.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.136
She already lives in London.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.815
So you go to Tokyo.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.483
Forget it.

12:34.787 --> 12:37.517
You told her you love her.
It's over.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.816
It is not over!
You're over!

12:42.228 --> 12:43.661
What?

12:45.664 --> 12:47.529
You know.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.566
Good one.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.976
It's not over. She'll call
and tell you she loves you.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.375
Her feelings were so strong
that it scared her.

13:02.581 --> 13:07.075
Go home and wait for her call.
She could call from the plane.

13:07.419 --> 13:11.685
But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over!

13:11.891 --> 13:16.760
Unless, eventually, I call her
to see what's going on...

13:16.962 --> 13:21.058
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.202
Then it's over!

13:24.904 --> 13:26.394
Way to be strong!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.911
Can we watch cartoons on your TV?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.450
We need a porn break.

13:42.721 --> 13:46.657
We spent two hours watching
In and Out and In Again.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.485
Why don't you turn it off?

13:50.763 --> 13:54.199
Then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

13:54.366 --> 13:58.666
Yeah, but that's not
what you'd go by.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.739
Look, I'm going
to have a kid someday. Okay?

14:01.907 --> 14:05.604
And someday that kid is going to ask me
if I ever turned off free porn.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.709
I don't wanna have to tell him that I did.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.315
Did you ever asked you dad that?

14:11.483 --> 14:13.610
I don't want to talk about it.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.978
Good, you're here!

14:18.324 --> 14:19.586
What you got there?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.659
This? I'm glad you asked.

14:25.798 --> 14:30.826
Don't you hate to cut a tin can
with an ordinary steak knife?

14:34.340 --> 14:36.171
I know what you're thinking.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.173
Pregnant woman slays four?

14:40.446 --> 14:43.176
-Did they make you pay for those knives?
-No.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.283
-Are you sure?
-No.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.245
You won't make enough money
by selling knives.

14:50.422 --> 14:54.620
I just need enough money
for the second part of my plan.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.090
-What's that?
-My Saturn dealership.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.763
Hello.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.469
-Ross.
-Emily. Hi.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.681
How was your flight?

15:16.949 --> 15:18.177
It was dreadful.

15:18.384 --> 15:22.821
It was terrible how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.420
No, that's all right.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.126
I'm just glad you called.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.956
Ross, there's something
that I've got to tell you.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.235
There's someone else.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.838
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

15:48.180 --> 15:52.514
She doesn't know who she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.587
So I told her when she figures it out,
give me a call. Maybe I'll still be around.

15:56.755 --> 16:01.419
When you say "still around," you mean still
around like you might be in a relationship...

16:01.593 --> 16:05.927
...or still around like you might have died
waiting for the phone to ring?

16:07.166 --> 16:09.031
But it was so right.

16:09.201 --> 16:13.535
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
There can't be another guy.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.341
Of course, there's another guy!

16:17.609 --> 16:19.543
This is even more perfect.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.946
You have to prove your love!

16:23.215 --> 16:27.083
I'm not proving anything.
I'm done listening to you.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.550
If I hadn't let you talk me
into this...

16:29.755 --> 16:32.451
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.249
You did that?

16:34.526 --> 16:36.790
I missed and hit the door.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.161
But it opened really hard.

16:41.967 --> 16:45.926
You have to go to London.
You have to go fight for her.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.730
That makes sense.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.067
You said you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

16:51.276 --> 16:55.736
Then she told you about another guy.
Go to London. Scare her!

16:58.751 --> 17:00.981
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

17:01.620 --> 17:03.178
I made fun of his accent.

17:03.956 --> 17:07.517
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.720
I just told you,
I made fun of him behind his back.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.660
Oh, I see.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.698
-You want that to happen with Emily?
-No.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.770
All right then, go fight for her!

17:23.142 --> 17:25.440
It's like a snake pit.

17:25.811 --> 17:28.439
That could be you and Emily.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.341
That but nicer.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.313
Go to London!

17:36.288 --> 17:37.277
Really?

17:37.456 --> 17:42.052
Surprise her.
Don't let her go without a fight.

17:42.928 --> 17:46.125
All right. I'm going to do it.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.789
I'm going to London,
and I'll fight for her.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.629
Okay. Good luck!

17:54.006 --> 17:58.170
Can you pick me up one
of those Toblerone bars at the airport?

18:05.250 --> 18:09.619
I did it!
I figured out a way to make money.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.791
I'll open a massage place.
Frank will help me.

18:12.958 --> 18:17.224
We'll work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.063
But how can you afford it?

18:21.333 --> 18:24.734
We were walking down the street,
and we saw your van.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.302
-And we realized
-I'm telling it!

18:29.208 --> 18:33.542
People need transportation,
and they need massages to relax.

18:33.846 --> 18:38.374
We can combine the two.
I give massages and Frank drives.

18:38.650 --> 18:42.381
I'll bolt a table in the van,
and you know what I've got?

18:42.654 --> 18:45.555
A place that no one
will get out of alive?

18:46.859 --> 18:51.990
Think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.825
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!

18:56.001 --> 18:58.299
The name was my favorite part!

18:59.238 --> 19:02.105
-I came up with it.
-You did not!

19:05.544 --> 19:09.207
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

19:14.419 --> 19:17.946
Oh, my god! Are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.182
No, she hasn't come home yet.

19:20.359 --> 19:25.058
She hasn't been home all night.
She must be with the other guy.

19:25.297 --> 19:29.028
I'm the stupid moron
who spent the night here.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.729
-What was that?
-I just put my fist through another wall.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.395
Tell the guys.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.867
When is the next flight out?

19:38.043 --> 19:39.169
About four hours.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.178
Stay there for a while.
If she doesn't show up, come home.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.647
There's a girl at the restaurant
that would be perfect for you.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.212
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

19:50.422 --> 19:53.721
Ask him if he likes it
better than Relaxi-Cab.

19:54.560 --> 19:59.020
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.392
That is better.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.365
Do you have any 8's?

20:07.539 --> 20:09.029
No.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.614
Are we in London?

20:22.354 --> 20:24.686
Why are you here?
You can't be here.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.824
I've come to talk to Ross.

20:30.762 --> 20:31.751
What?

20:34.866 --> 20:36.458
Nothing.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.468
I was going to call him

20:38.637 --> 20:41.606
You came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

20:41.873 --> 20:44.068
I was right!
I'm right, right?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.704
I'd rather talk to him.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.982
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.982
I need to talk to him.
Do you know where he is?

21:05.831 --> 21:07.162
Ross, are you there?

21:10.669 --> 21:15.197
Ross, I don't know if you hear this,
but I'll talk anyway.

21:15.507 --> 21:18.567
I'm in the States
with your sister and friends.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.008
It's all over with Colin.

21:22.681 --> 21:25.411
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you

21:25.651 --> 21:29.178
Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want.

21:32.157 --> 21:37.026
I came here to tell you
that I love you.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.257
I love you too!

21:39.531 --> 21:43.023
I'll call you right now
from the phone booth.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.065
You can't hear me.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.272
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.875
I suppose I've given
my neighbors a good laugh.

21:53.111 --> 21:57.445
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. None of your business.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.814
There's not much chance
you did hear that.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.816
There's the call waiting...

22:05.057 --> 22:07.821
...so I should go.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.517
Oh, well.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.629
Ross, I love you.

22:23.408 --> 22:25.000
Thank you.

22:37.322 --> 22:40.485
I was just at the bank.
There was this really hot teller...

22:40.659 --> 22:44.720
...and she didn't ask me
to do it with her in the vault.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.124
Same thing happened to me.

22:47.432 --> 22:52.062
Pizza delivery girl comes over,
gives me the pizza and leaves!

22:52.304 --> 22:55.569
No "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

22:55.807 --> 22:57.672
Nothing!

22:58.844 --> 23:01.677
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.507
I think you're right.

23:06.251 --> 23:07.240
Ready?

23:07.519 --> 23:09.749
One, two, three.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.153
That's kind of nice.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.093
That's kind of a relief.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.262
You want to see
if we still have it?

23:30.108 --> 23:32.702
-Free porn!
-We have free porn!

23:42.053 --> 23:45.784
There's one, two and three.

23:46.224 --> 23:49.091
-Oh, my God.
-That's so beautiful.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.195
-Oh, man.
-I can't believe it.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.557
I know.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.798
I like the middle one the best.

23:57.202 --> 24:00.330
Don't worry,
I won't let the other two know.
