WEBVTT

00:16.149 --> 00:18.549
-I'm sorry!
-That is it!

00:18.818 --> 00:21.218
You barge in here
and you don't knock?

00:21.421 --> 00:24.948
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!

00:25.191 --> 00:27.557
-Can I just say one thing?
-What?!

00:27.827 --> 00:31.126
That's a relatively open weave.
I can still see...

00:32.032 --> 00:33.693
...your nippular areas.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.264
The One With The Boobies

01:26.386 --> 01:30.117
Honey, tell them the story
about your patient...

01:30.323 --> 01:32.621
...who thinks things are
other things.

01:33.059 --> 01:35.994
When the phone rings
and she takes a shower.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.526
That's pretty much it.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.699
-But you tell it really well, sweetie.
-Thanks. Okay.

01:45.905 --> 01:48.465
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.442
Okay. I'll miss you.

01:52.679 --> 01:56.137
-lsn't he great?
-He's cute. He likes you so much.

01:56.349 --> 02:00.410
I know. He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

02:00.653 --> 02:03.679
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.084
Think you'll do it on his couch?

02:06.326 --> 02:09.090
I don't know. That's a little weird.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.762
It's vinyl.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.365
Okay, you guys want anything else?

02:16.569 --> 02:20.198
-Could I have?
-We're all out. Anybody else?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.703
Did I miss something?

02:22.942 --> 02:26.139
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.881
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

02:30.150 --> 02:35.645
It was an accident. I wasn't
across the street with a telescope.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.585
Can we change the subject, please?

02:38.791 --> 02:43.023
These aren't her "boobies."
These are her breasts.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.666
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.859
I always liked "Bazoombas."

02:51.070 --> 02:52.662
Gives them a Latin spin.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.309
Can we drop this already, please?

02:58.178 --> 03:01.841
Why are you embarrassed?
They were very nice boobies.

03:03.082 --> 03:05.744
"Nice"? They were "nice"?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.749
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."

03:10.857 --> 03:14.224
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.364
You're so funny!

03:22.569 --> 03:24.400
He's really funny.

03:24.804 --> 03:28.535
I wouldn't wanna be there
when the laughter stops.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.903
Whoa, back up there, sparky.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.879
What did you mean by that?

03:35.248 --> 03:38.411
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

03:38.651 --> 03:42.519
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.721
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

03:49.696 --> 03:50.856
Only child, right?

03:52.265 --> 03:55.029
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

03:57.036 --> 04:00.062
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.

04:03.176 --> 04:06.145
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?

04:06.879 --> 04:10.337
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days. I got a job.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.744
I'm better off staying with Joey...

04:12.952 --> 04:15.580
...than going back and forth
on the ferry.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.848
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.821
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.928
-What happened to the puppet guy?
-Dad.

04:25.398 --> 04:29.858
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.830
0 for 2, huh?

04:34.674 --> 04:36.733
Chandler, say something funny.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.613
I gotta go. Miss you too.

04:48.921 --> 04:52.857
-I love you, but it's getting late
-Say hi. Hey, Ma.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.755
I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and

04:57.864 --> 04:59.058
Excuse me?

05:02.902 --> 05:05.097
Did you know this isn't Ma?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.545
Her name's Ronni.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.678
She's a pet mortician.

05:21.754 --> 05:22.914
Sure.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.890
So, how long you been...?

05:28.528 --> 05:32.692
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the navy yard?

05:32.899 --> 05:36.528
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.

05:36.736 --> 05:41.969
I wanted you to think of a nice memory
so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.074
-What are you doing?
-Chopping garlic.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.871
You don't crush it?

05:48.081 --> 05:52.518
You're having an affair,
I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.017
Joe, you ever been in love?

05:57.957 --> 06:00.949
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.495
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to talk.

06:07.233 --> 06:12.136
Your dad's in love. The worst part is,
it's with two different women.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.397
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

06:15.608 --> 06:19.669
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.681
It's like if you woke up
and found out...

06:29.922 --> 06:32.152
...your dad leads this double life.

06:32.358 --> 06:36.351
He's like actually some spy
working for the ClA.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.294
That'd be cool.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.531
This blows!

06:41.768 --> 06:43.360
Do you think Dad cheated?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.231
I don't think so.
That would involve sex.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.875
I'd like to think that our parents
don't do that.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.874
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

06:57.083 --> 07:01.144
Why do they have to become people?
Why do they have?

07:01.754 --> 07:02.743
Why...

07:04.924 --> 07:08.257
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

07:09.629 --> 07:10.823
What?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.396
What?

07:15.201 --> 07:17.965
Didn't you get a good enough look?

07:18.171 --> 07:22.437
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.

07:22.675 --> 07:26.975
Since you saw her boobies you have
to show her your pee-pee.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.184
You know,
I don't see that happening.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.291
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.691
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!

07:53.873 --> 07:56.273
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

07:57.810 --> 07:58.868
Come on up.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.911
Oh, good! Rog is here.

08:03.282 --> 08:08.515
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a little thing. I hate that guy!

08:09.188 --> 08:12.851
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.957
Come on, he's not that bad.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.924
You're wrong! Why would I marry her...

08:18.197 --> 08:20.961
...if I thought that she was
a lesbian?

08:21.834 --> 08:25.270
I don't know. Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

08:30.743 --> 08:34.474
Why? Why would l? Why?

08:34.680 --> 08:38.514
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

08:38.751 --> 08:43.381
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe

08:43.589 --> 08:46.080
Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.692
Well, I don't know.

08:48.895 --> 08:52.058
You could've sabotaged
your marriage...

08:52.331 --> 08:55.926
...so the sibling would feel like
less of a failure.

08:59.705 --> 09:03.664
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.140
-You think I'm a failure?
-lsn't he good?

09:09.348 --> 09:12.545
Yeah. No, that's not
what I was saying.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.777
I thought you were on my side.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.683
But maybe you sucked up
to them so they'd favor you.

09:18.925 --> 09:22.622
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

09:26.299 --> 09:29.132
You're right. I mean, you're right.

09:29.368 --> 09:33.236
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but the Weeble Play Palace...

09:35.841 --> 09:38.071
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

09:38.344 --> 09:42.212
...with this lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.776
And Mom just gave them all away.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.050
That's tough, tough stuff.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.521
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta go.

09:53.726 --> 09:57.457
-Feel better.
-We're gonna be late, sweetie.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.461
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.061
Listen, it was great seeing you again.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.271
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

10:08.541 --> 10:12.170
Remember, they're just food,
they're not love.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.409
I hate that guy!

10:22.021 --> 10:23.352
Good night, you guys.

10:26.392 --> 10:29.020
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.326
Hey, can we help you?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.895
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.872
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.935
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

10:47.146 --> 10:49.706
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.876
I'm Ronni.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.248
Cheese Nip?

11:00.793 --> 11:04.820
Joey's having an embolism,
but I'd go for a nip.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.663
Most people,
when their pets pass on...

11:13.873 --> 11:16.535
...want them like they're sleeping.

11:16.742 --> 11:20.769
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.107
Like chasing their tail.

11:23.582 --> 11:27.382
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.954
Joey, if I go first,
I wanna be looking for my keys.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.917
-That's a good one!
-Hey.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.357
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.656
-Hi.
-Hey.

11:39.865 --> 11:44.461
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?

11:44.670 --> 11:47.537
Oh, you left your hair at my place.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.038
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.737
Thank you.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.677
So, who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

12:03.122 --> 12:06.114
Look, I shouldn't have come.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.622
I better go. I'll miss the train.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.992
-I don't want you taking that thing.
-Where do I stay? Here?

12:15.167 --> 12:17.192
We'll go to a hotel.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.537
We'll go to a hotel.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.263
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.372
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.409
I want you here so I can
keep an eye on you.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.606
-You're gonna keep an eye on us?
-Right.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.376
As long as you are under my roof...

12:34.587 --> 12:36.987
...you're gonna live by my rules.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.392
That means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.791
Wow, he's strict.

12:47.333 --> 12:51.064
Dad, you'll be in my room.
You can stay in Chandler's room.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.170
And Chandler will be?

12:53.739 --> 12:55.832
Out here with me, bunking up.

12:56.041 --> 13:00.478
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores,
don't be alarmed.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.170
Thanks. You're a good kid.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.373
I'll show you to my room.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.988
That sounds weird not followed by,
"No, it's late."

13:15.161 --> 13:20.155
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.390
Change?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.568
-Break up with Ronni
-I can't!

13:23.836 --> 13:26.930
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

13:27.139 --> 13:29.733
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

13:43.722 --> 13:45.314
Hey, kickie!

13:47.893 --> 13:50.521
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortable.

13:50.796 --> 13:54.095
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

14:00.539 --> 14:05.636
I was thinking about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls....

14:08.314 --> 14:11.579
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

14:12.184 --> 14:15.210
You know, how I date all these women.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.581
I always figured, when the right one
comes along...

14:18.791 --> 14:21.760
... I'll be able to go the distance.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.518
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking

14:24.730 --> 14:27.062
You're not him, you're you.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.868
When they wanted you in
your father's business, did you cave?

14:32.071 --> 14:33.129
-No.
-No.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.740
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.010
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

14:40.679 --> 14:43.580
I believe when the right woman
comes along...

14:43.782 --> 14:48.685
...you'll have the guts to say,
"No, thanks, I'm married."

14:54.126 --> 14:57.789
-You really think so?
-Yeah, I really do.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.056
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

15:12.778 --> 15:14.643
-Hi.
-Hi. May I help you?

15:14.847 --> 15:19.875
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.575
Okay. Who are you?

15:22.588 --> 15:25.148
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.621
The mistress?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.392
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.531
I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.167
Ronni, how long has Chandler
been in the shower?

15:37.369 --> 15:40.133
Oh, like five minutes.

15:40.339 --> 15:41.499
Perfect.

15:43.642 --> 15:47.874
Fasten your seat belts,
it's pee-pee time.

15:53.085 --> 15:56.282
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.

15:58.123 --> 16:02.082
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.407
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

16:17.609 --> 16:21.306
You were supposed to be in there
so I'd see your thing!

16:22.815 --> 16:25.648
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.617
-How's it going?
-Good.

16:36.829 --> 16:41.323
Roger's having a dinner thing.
He wanted me to invite you guys.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.334
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.

16:47.573 --> 16:48.733
It's just....

16:49.942 --> 16:52.035
It's Roger, you know?

16:52.244 --> 16:54.007
There's something about

16:54.213 --> 16:56.272
We just feel that he's....

16:56.548 --> 16:59.039
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!

16:59.385 --> 17:02.149
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.881
Don't you think it's just that
he's so perceptive...

17:06.158 --> 17:07.750
...it freaked you out?

17:07.960 --> 17:09.757
No, we hate him!

17:09.962 --> 17:11.122
I'm sorry.

17:24.443 --> 17:29.847
-Ma! What are you doing here?
-I came to give you this and this!

17:30.249 --> 17:31.807
Big ring!

17:32.017 --> 17:35.316
Why'd you fill your father's head
with garbage...

17:35.521 --> 17:37.751
...about making things right?

17:38.190 --> 17:40.249
Things were fine this way!

17:40.492 --> 17:43.154
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.222
For God's sake, Joey! Really.

17:48.934 --> 17:53.166
-Hold on. You knew?
-Of course I knew. What do you think?

17:53.372 --> 17:55.431
Your father is no James Bond.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.834
You should've heard his stories.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.534
"I'm sleeping over
at my accountant's."

18:00.746 --> 18:04.842
-What is that? Please!
-So then, how could you?

18:05.050 --> 18:07.712
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

18:07.920 --> 18:11.117
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

18:11.323 --> 18:16.090
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

18:16.295 --> 18:20.595
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

18:23.202 --> 18:26.262
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful...

18:26.872 --> 18:29.568
... but what the hell
are you talking about?

18:29.975 --> 18:33.706
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

18:33.912 --> 18:37.746
Look, honey, in an ideal world...

18:37.950 --> 18:42.319
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.016
And something else:

18:45.224 --> 18:48.682
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...

18:48.894 --> 18:53.331
... he's so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

18:53.532 --> 18:58.026
He's been more loving. It's like
every day is our anniversary.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.533
-I'm happy for you?
-Well, don't be!

19:03.075 --> 19:04.906
Now everything's screwed up.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.643
I just want it the way it was.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.783
Ma, I'm sorry.

19:14.019 --> 19:17.182
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

19:17.789 --> 19:21.657
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

19:24.630 --> 19:28.657
So tell me. Did you see her?

19:30.235 --> 19:31.463
Yeah.

19:32.204 --> 19:36.300
-You're 10 times prettier than she is.
-That's sweet.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.000
Could I take her?

19:41.146 --> 19:43.478
With this ring, no contest.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.119
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!

19:57.329 --> 19:58.523
-What?
-I'm sorry.

19:58.730 --> 20:02.257
I have a thing,
which means you can't ever do that!

20:04.736 --> 20:08.228
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.238
-No, what's wrong? Come on.
-Okay.

20:15.614 --> 20:19.550
It's nothing. I'm fine.
It's just It's my friends.

20:19.851 --> 20:22.445
They have a liking problem with you...

20:22.721 --> 20:25.554
...in that they don't.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.286
They don't?

20:31.396 --> 20:35.696
But they don't see all
the wonderfulness that I see.

20:35.934 --> 20:39.426
They don't see all the good
and sweet stuff.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.038
-They think you're a little
-What?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.641
Intense and creepy.

20:47.412 --> 20:51.246
-Oh.
-But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

20:53.452 --> 20:58.321
-I'm not at all surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.817
It's quite typical behavior...

21:01.126 --> 21:05.256
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

21:05.464 --> 21:09.958
You know, this kind of codependent,
emotionally stunted...

21:10.269 --> 21:15.502
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

21:15.707 --> 21:19.143
...which might as well
have nipples on them.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.806
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me! Define me!

21:25.050 --> 21:27.814
Love me! I need love!

21:29.321 --> 21:30.948
You talked to your dad?

21:31.156 --> 21:34.250
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma
like she wanted.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.155
Ma will keep pretending
she doesn't know.

21:37.362 --> 21:40.058
And my sister, Tina,
can't see her husband.

21:40.265 --> 21:42.324
He got a restraining order.

21:43.201 --> 21:46.762
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.

21:47.939 --> 21:51.272
Things have changed here
on Waltons'mountain.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.736
-So, Joey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.347
It's just You know, they're parents.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.383
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

22:01.853 --> 22:05.914
You gotta let them
make their own mistakes.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.692
And think, in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.192
Oh, please.

22:11.396 --> 22:15.730
If I turn into my parents, I'll be
an alcoholic blond chasing men...

22:15.934 --> 22:19.233
...or I'll end up like my mom!

22:23.675 --> 22:25.609
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.506
How's it going?

22:27.713 --> 22:30.546
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.346
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, really.

22:37.656 --> 22:41.353
-What happened?
-I don't know. I mean...

22:41.560 --> 22:45.189
... he's a good person,
and he can be really sweet.

22:45.831 --> 22:48.732
In some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.368
It's just.... I hate that guy!

22:59.144 --> 23:01.738
Hi, Joey. What's going on?

23:01.947 --> 23:04.609
Clear the tracks
for the boobie payback.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.114
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

23:12.924 --> 23:15.154
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

23:15.827 --> 23:18.125
Sorry, wrong boobies!

23:31.343 --> 23:32.469
Hello, Joey!

23:34.012 --> 23:35.206
Hello, dear!
