-You ready to go?
-Let me just finish this.

00:04.576 --> 00:07.810
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

00:12.525 --> 00:14.289
Yeah, l can<i>'</i>t do that.

00:15.731 --> 00:17.667
-What are you doing?
-Have you seen this?

00:17.835 --> 00:20.271
lt<i>'</i>s our new alumni website
for college.

00:20.473 --> 00:24.174
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you<i>'</i>re up to.

00:24.381 --> 00:28.789
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that l'm unemployed and childless.

00:28.991 --> 00:31.963
lt<i>'</i>s actually interesting to find
out what people are doing.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.565
Remember Andrea Rich?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.896
That tall girl that wouldn<i>'</i>t sleep
with you?

00:36.138 --> 00:40.876
Well, her lnternet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

00:42.217 --> 00:44.711
Bet she<i>'</i>d sleep with you now.

00:46.158 --> 00:48.721
No, l already e-mailed her.

00:49.933 --> 00:52.734
Let me see what you wrote
about yourself.

00:52.905 --> 00:55.900
''Doctor of paleontology, two kids.''

00:56.112 --> 00:59.711
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?

00:59.886 --> 01:04.350
l think you split with Carol because
you had one very similar interest.

01:05.463 --> 01:08.367
l'm gonna finish this later, okay?
Let me just grab my coat.

01:08.537 --> 01:10.632
Okay!

01:13.112 --> 01:17.109
What, did you think you learned how
to do it in the last two minutes?

01:20.561 --> 01:24.398
Maybe we finish this for him.

01:27.975 --> 01:31.779
Also, l cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

01:32.484 --> 01:35.456
She is now my girlfriend.

01:36.425 --> 01:41.892
l don<i>'</i>t care what society says,
it<i>'</i>s the best sex l<i>'</i>ve ever had.

01:42.270 --> 01:46.507
-And send.
-No, no-- You can<i>'</i>t do that to him.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.706
-All right, let<i>'</i>s go.
-Dude!

01:48.917 --> 01:53.415
l think you made it clear you can<i>'</i>t be
trusted with the ball inside the house.

02:00.039 --> 02:03.170
And send.

02:42.223 --> 02:44.489
Hey. How was basketball?

02:44.696 --> 02:47.566
lt was fun. Right up until Chandler
got a finger in the eye.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.602
Oh, no! Who did that?

02:49.839 --> 02:52.173
Chandler. Yeah.

02:52.678 --> 02:54.476
Hey!

02:55.383 --> 02:56.579
-Rach?
-Yeah?

02:56.786 --> 02:59.758
What<i>'</i>s Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?

03:00.426 --> 03:05.095
She was just crawling around and found
him, so l just let her sleep with him.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.970
-That<i>'</i>s all right, isn<i>'</i>t it?
-Of course. Yeah.

03:09.144 --> 03:14.416
lt<i>'</i>s a stuffed animal, you know?
lt<i>'</i>s for kids. Not for adults.

03:14.589 --> 03:16.285
l know that.

03:16.526 --> 03:19.395
Joey, you're sure? l mean,
l know how much you love him.

03:19.565 --> 03:24.769
Rachel, let<i>'</i>s be clear on this, okay?
l do not love Huggsy.

03:25.042 --> 03:27.775
l like him a normal amount.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.555
All right. Well, Emma loves him.

03:31.756 --> 03:35.160
Yeah. Well, why wouldn<i>'</i>t she?
He<i>'</i>s a wonderful person!

03:39.872 --> 03:42.935
-Hi.
-Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

03:43.112 --> 03:46.380
-You feeling better?
-Breaking up sucks.

03:46.586 --> 03:50.389
-Oh, l really miss Mike.
-Oh, l'm so sorry.

03:50.627 --> 03:54.396
l've tried everything to feel better.
l even tried writing a song about it...

03:54.602 --> 03:57.699
...but l can<i>'</i>t think of anything
that rhymes with:

04:00.079 --> 04:02.573
Oh, l so know how you feel.

04:03.319 --> 04:07.453
Breaking up with Richard was
the hardest thing l've ever done in my life.

04:09.331 --> 04:13.796
All right, fine, l'll put another dollar
in the Richard jar.

04:14.509 --> 04:17.446
Hey, Monica, l'm gonna need
your help getting through this.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.811
You're saying you<i>'</i>re
not gonna need my help?

04:20.019 --> 04:22.251
No. When l get to the point
where l'm ready...

04:22.423 --> 04:25.794
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes
about Mike, l'm gonna come to you.

04:25.964 --> 04:29.927
Oh, good, because l<i>'</i>ve already thought
of three. Four! l just thought of a fourth!

04:30.974 --> 04:33.467
Okay. l mean, l know
l did the right thing.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.273
Mike never wants to get married...

04:35.449 --> 04:38.387
...and l shouldn<i>'</i>t be in a relationship
that has no future.

04:38.557 --> 04:40.891
But pretty soon,
l'm gonna miss him so much...

04:41.061 --> 04:44.033
...l'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.501
Okay, you got it.

04:48.510 --> 04:51.914
Unless....
Am l being too crazy about this?

04:52.083 --> 04:56.957
All right, so there<i>'</i>s no future. But that
doesn<i>'</i>t mean we still can<i>'</i>t have fun.

04:57.327 --> 05:00.858
-You know what? Forget what l said.
-Really?

05:01.101 --> 05:04.802
-All right, if that<i>'</i>s what you want.
-That was a test, and you just failed.

05:05.844 --> 05:08.839
Damn it! Rookie mistake!

05:12.992 --> 05:15.485
l have sex with dinosaurs?

05:18.135 --> 05:20.800
l believe l read that somewhere.

05:21.576 --> 05:24.376
Not only is it not funny,
it<i>'</i>s physically impossible! Okay?

05:24.582 --> 05:29.718
Depending on the species, l<i>'</i>d have
to have a 6-foot-long-- lt<i>'</i>s not funny!

05:31.028 --> 05:33.522
l respectfully disagree.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.101
l can<i>'</i>t believe you put that
on my alumni page.

05:36.304 --> 05:38.901
-Who cares? Nobody reads those.
-You better hope not...

05:39.144 --> 05:41.376
...because l just read what
you put on your page.

05:41.616 --> 05:44.918
-l don<i>'</i>t have a page.
-Oh, l respectfully disagree!

05:55.510 --> 05:57.445
Huggsy?

05:57.614 --> 05:58.809
Huggsy?

05:58.983 --> 06:00.782
Huggsy.

06:03.492 --> 06:05.223
l want my penguin.

06:19.257 --> 06:23.254
<i>Look at you. All sweet and innocent,</i>
<i>sleeping like an angel.</i>

06:23.833 --> 06:27.397
<i>With Emma</i>'<i>s chubby little hands</i>
<i>wrapped around you.</i>

06:29.344 --> 06:32.806
lt<i>'</i>s okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

06:34.487 --> 06:37.357
Step away from the crib!
l have a weapon!

06:37.528 --> 06:41.297
lt<i>'</i>s okay! lt<i>'</i>s okay, Rach!
lt<i>'</i>s me! Put down the scrunchie.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.905
-What are you doing?
-Well, l heard Emma stirring...

06:45.075 --> 06:48.606
...so l came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.

06:49.217 --> 06:53.351
Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that
l'm up, l'm gonna go to the bathroom.

06:53.526 --> 06:57.090
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.563
This isn<i>'</i>t over!

07:04.047 --> 07:07.110
Wait a second. Why would
Ross tell everyone in your class...

07:07.353 --> 07:11.157
...that you are ''as gay
as the day is long''?

07:12.129 --> 07:15.295
Because l told everyone
he slept with dinosaurs.

07:15.937 --> 07:20.777
Well, that<i>'</i>s clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.

07:22.250 --> 07:26.521
Would you get that, please? People have
been calling to congratulate me all day.

07:29.965 --> 07:31.126
Hello?

07:31.301 --> 07:35.332
No, he<i>'</i>s not here.
Yeah, this is his wife.

07:35.644 --> 07:39.516
Yeah. Well, it came
as quite a shock to me too!

07:40.687 --> 07:45.355
Well, l guess l should<i>'</i>ve known. He just
kept making me watch <i>Moulin Rouge.</i>

07:45.530 --> 07:47.158
Hang up! Hang up!

07:47.333 --> 07:49.326
And that was a great movie.

07:51.241 --> 07:54.042
l'm so gonna get back at Ross.

07:54.213 --> 07:56.582
Oh, yeah, this<i>'</i>ll show him.
Here we go.

07:56.819 --> 08:00.155
-What are you doing?
-Oh, you<i>'</i>ll see, my friend!

08:04.668 --> 08:07.195
l'm dead?

08:09.043 --> 08:11.240
And so young.

08:11.916 --> 08:15.720
Posting that l died?
That really isn<i>'</i>t funny.

08:16.424 --> 08:17.893
Well, how you died was funny.

08:18.095 --> 08:20.760
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

08:21.569 --> 08:25.703
lt kills over one Americans every year.

08:26.444 --> 08:29.747
Unbelievable. My classmates
are gonna think l'm dead.

08:29.918 --> 08:32.981
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone calls!

08:33.158 --> 08:35.151
You<i>'</i>re messing with
people<i>'</i>s feelings here.

08:35.396 --> 08:38.961
You wanna talk about people<i>'</i>s feelings?
You should have heard how hurt...

08:39.137 --> 08:43.168
...Professor Stern was when l told him
l wouldn<i>'</i>t be able to go to Key West!

08:44.080 --> 08:46.950
You<i>'</i>ve really crossed a line here.
But that<i>'</i>s okay.

08:47.119 --> 08:49.920
Because l'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...

08:50.092 --> 08:51.652
...and a stack of gay porn.

08:51.829 --> 08:55.963
That<i>'</i>s right. Your coming-out
is about to get real graphic!

09:00.814 --> 09:03.513
God, l wish Mike were here.

09:03.986 --> 09:07.152
Okay, if Mike were here, what
would the two of you be doing?

09:08.462 --> 09:12.334
What are you, animals?
lt<i>'</i>s 4:00 in the afternoon.

09:12.671 --> 09:16.166
l gotta call him. Just to talk to him.
There<i>'</i>s no harm in that.

09:16.344 --> 09:21.754
That<i>'</i>s how it starts. ''l don<i>'</i>t need
to eat the cake, l'll just smell the icing.

09:21.922 --> 09:26.022
Why not just a little sliver?''
Or, ''Okay, just a slice or two.''

09:26.197 --> 09:28.394
The next thing you know,
you<i>'</i>re 21 0 pounds...

09:28.569 --> 09:31.369
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunnel slide!

09:34.213 --> 09:36.707
-That's not true, is it?
-They had to cut me out...

09:36.886 --> 09:38.583
...with the Jaws of Life.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.424
Phoebe, honey, l know this is hard.

09:42.597 --> 09:45.831
But look, if you talk to him,
then you<i>'</i>re gonna want to see him.

09:46.004 --> 09:48.771
And if you see him, you<i>'</i>re gonna
wanna get back together.

09:48.943 --> 09:51.676
And l know that<i>'</i>s not what you want.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.681
All right, so give me your phone.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.823
Here.

09:58.195 --> 10:02.260
-And now your cell.
-Okay.

10:06.277 --> 10:08.646
There you go.

10:14.962 --> 10:18.697
-This is your cell phone?
-Yes.

10:18.936 --> 10:22.238
This is your current cell phone?

10:22.844 --> 10:26.180
Yes. lt reminds me of a simpler time.

10:27.721 --> 10:31.216
Phoebe? Where<i>'</i>s your purse?

10:32.697 --> 10:34.325
-Hey! No!
-No!

10:34.501 --> 10:36.265
-Give it to me!
-You can<i>'</i>t have it!

10:36.471 --> 10:38.533
-Give it to me!
-No!

10:40.680 --> 10:42.616
-l<i>'</i>ll go in there!
-Oh, yeah.

10:42.784 --> 10:44.013
-Phoebe, come here!
-No!

10:44.186 --> 10:48.126
-Give it to me!
-You're crazy!

10:50.633 --> 10:53.696
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

10:55.142 --> 10:59.948
Don't even think of sneaking out
and using a pay phone...

11:00.118 --> 11:02.817
...because l am everywhere, baby!

11:05.897 --> 11:11.101
Hey, look who<i>'</i>s here. lt<i>'</i>s Joey.
And he brought home a friend.

11:11.307 --> 11:15.441
Emma<i>'</i>s right here. You promised not to
bring girls home in the middle of the day!

11:15.650 --> 11:18.554
No, no, no, it<i>'</i>s not a girl. lt<i>'</i>s...

11:18.723 --> 11:21.455
...a brand-new Huggsy!

11:21.662 --> 11:24.930
Oh! Oh, that<i>'</i>s so great!
Now Emma has two Huggsies!

11:25.135 --> 11:29.166
No, no. Oh, no.
No, Emma has one Huggsy.

11:29.343 --> 11:31.074
The new Huggsy.

11:31.247 --> 11:34.812
The other Huggsy, l don<i>'</i>t know,
l guess l<i>'</i>ll just take him back.

11:34.988 --> 11:39.862
You know what? When l was a little girl,
l had a little pink pony named Cotton.

11:40.065 --> 11:44.530
Oh, l loved her so much. l took her
everywhere. l would braid her tail--

11:44.708 --> 11:46.678
Make the transfer!

11:50.787 --> 11:54.784
Should l be concerned that a button fell
off the old Huggsy and l can<i>'</i>t find it?

11:54.995 --> 11:58.901
No, don<i>'</i>t worry about it.
l swallowed that years ago. Hey!

12:00.205 --> 12:03.736
Oh, what? l don<i>'</i>t think
she likes the new Huggsy.

12:04.013 --> 12:06.814
-But he<i>'</i>s the same.
-l think she wants the old one back.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.014
-Yeah, but he<i>'</i>s the same.
-Joey, come on.

12:10.225 --> 12:12.856
But he<i>'</i>s the same!

12:15.469 --> 12:18.032
You<i>'</i>re not the same.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.275
You know, it<i>'</i>s a lot
less surprising to do that...

12:24.453 --> 12:26.754
...after l<i>'</i>ve buzzed you
into the building.

12:28.061 --> 12:31.397
So, Phoebe, why are there
men<i>'</i>s shoes by the door?

12:32.236 --> 12:34.673
Those are my shoes.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.972
Well, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.

12:38.582 --> 12:41.611
Look, Monica, l really appreciate
you checking in on me.

12:41.788 --> 12:44.258
-But l'm actually feeling a lot better.
-You are?

12:44.426 --> 12:46.863
Yeah, l just kind of want
to be alone right now.

12:49.470 --> 12:53.639
-Who<i>'</i>s that?
-l ordered Chinese food.

12:55.850 --> 12:58.879
What are the chances?!

12:59.189 --> 13:03.027
One billion Chinese people,
and they send Mike!

13:06.003 --> 13:08.303
-What are you doing here?
-Phoebe called me.

13:08.609 --> 13:11.102
-Phoebe!
-l'm sorry. l broke down.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.579
l wanted to see him.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.617
Well, not on my watch.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.719
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?

13:17.927 --> 13:20.193
There<i>'</i>s a speakerphone
on the base unit.

13:22.069 --> 13:25.439
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

13:25.610 --> 13:27.374
-Can l come in?
-No! No.

13:27.547 --> 13:31.749
Phoebe, isn't seeing Mike exactly what
you wanted me to stop you from doing?

13:33.091 --> 13:36.359
-Look, if l want to see Phoebe, and she--
-This doesn<i>'</i>t concern you!

13:37.734 --> 13:41.104
Sorry. l guess l was thrown off
by the mention of my name.

13:42.844 --> 13:45.076
Look, guys, you can<i>'</i>t do this.

13:45.248 --> 13:47.651
lt<i>'</i>s gonna make getting
over each other harder.

13:47.854 --> 13:51.954
Not if nothing happens.
Why can<i>'</i>t we just hang out as friends?

13:53.498 --> 13:57.268
Sure. lf you<i>'</i>re just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe l<i>'</i>ll join you.

13:57.472 --> 14:00.239
You know, l'm your friend
and Mike<i>'</i>s friend.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.547
Sit down.

14:09.363 --> 14:11.390
Make room for your friend.

14:21.454 --> 14:24.324
-So how have you been?
-l<i>'</i>ve been pretty good.

14:29.103 --> 14:33.066
-You look really beautiful.
-Thanks. You look good too.

14:33.244 --> 14:37.982
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.

14:39.256 --> 14:40.885
So how<i>'</i>s the piano playing going?

14:41.093 --> 14:44.429
Actually, l<i>'</i>ve been playing a lot
of love songs lately.

14:44.601 --> 14:48.472
-l<i>'</i>ve missed you.
-l<i>'</i>ve missed you too.

14:51.180 --> 14:56.248
You know, on the way over here,
l saw this drunk guy throw up.

14:57.492 --> 15:00.293
And then a pigeon ate it.

15:04.206 --> 15:05.766
Hey. Ross.

15:06.110 --> 15:09.139
Look, l just wanted to apologize.

15:09.349 --> 15:13.289
Don<i>'</i>t tell me you actually made
those gay pictures of me.

15:13.992 --> 15:15.723
Check this out.

15:15.930 --> 15:19.232
So that<i>'</i>s what l<i>'</i>d look like
if l worked out.

15:19.904 --> 15:23.468
And was being serviced
by a policeman.

15:23.645 --> 15:25.808
You<i>'</i>re not gonna actually
send these out, are you?

15:26.016 --> 15:29.979
Actually, l don<i>'</i>t need to, because your
little ''Ross is dead'' joke didn<i>'</i>t work.

15:30.158 --> 15:31.923
Okay? There were no responses.

15:32.095 --> 15:36.696
Nobody posted anything, nobody called
my parents, so the joke is on you.

15:36.905 --> 15:41.938
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that l'm dead.

15:45.823 --> 15:47.520
Oh, my God.

15:47.727 --> 15:51.359
-Nobody cares that l'm dead?
-Oh, come on, you know that<i>'</i>s not true.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.970
What are you talking about?
You get 60 responses...

15:54.139 --> 15:55.870
...just for coming out of the closet.

15:56.043 --> 15:59.311
l didn<i>'</i>t get one response,
and l'm dead!

15:59.483 --> 16:03.891
Well, the gay community is a lot more
vocal than the dead community.

16:04.059 --> 16:10.004
l can<i>'</i>t believe this. Not even my geology
lab partner. And l carried that guy!

16:10.238 --> 16:12.071
Look, let<i>'</i>s think about this, okay?

16:12.242 --> 16:15.476
You think people are gonna disturb
your family at this tragic time?

16:15.683 --> 16:18.381
That people are gonna post condolences
on a website?

16:18.555 --> 16:20.353
This isn<i>'</i>t about people not caring.

16:20.526 --> 16:25.525
This is about people not having
a decent outlet for their grief.

16:25.703 --> 16:28.401
-You<i>'</i>re right. There isn<i>'</i>t a decent outlet.
-Right.

16:28.608 --> 16:33.276
l'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial
service, tons of people would come.

16:33.885 --> 16:36.253
Exactly!

16:37.058 --> 16:39.460
Ross, what are you doing?

16:39.630 --> 16:41.964
You<i>'</i>re having a memorial service
for yourself?

16:42.335 --> 16:46.538
No, that would be stupid.
You<i>'</i>re having it for me.

16:46.778 --> 16:50.946
-Ross, don<i>'</i>t press send. Don<i>'</i>t press--
-No, too late. Too late. lt<i>'</i>s sent.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.354
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the policeman.

16:56.397 --> 16:59.996
That's all right. l'm tan, limber....

17:00.171 --> 17:03.143
And it looks like l talked my way
out of that ticket.

17:05.616 --> 17:08.554
The surgery was not a success.
And then you say:

17:08.722 --> 17:11.454
''What are we gonna do, Drake?''

17:18.407 --> 17:20.674
Come in.

17:22.482 --> 17:25.318
l'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?

17:25.522 --> 17:27.457
Original or crappy?

17:28.795 --> 17:31.322
-Original.
-No. Sorry. Haven<i>'</i>t seen him.

17:31.534 --> 17:34.734
Then what<i>'</i>s that big lump
under your covers?

17:35.509 --> 17:38.879
-lt<i>'</i>s Monica, okay?
-That<i>'</i>s not Monica!

17:39.049 --> 17:42.453
All right, fine! lt<i>'</i>s original Huggsy!

17:44.059 --> 17:46.622
l know Emma wants him,
but he<i>'</i>s mine and l need him.

17:46.798 --> 17:49.496
She<i>'</i>s being unreasonable.

17:49.704 --> 17:53.143
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
loves that stupid penguin so much!

17:53.344 --> 17:55.405
Oh, don<i>'</i>t cover its ears!

17:56.150 --> 17:59.885
lt<i>'</i>s because it reminds her
of her Uncle Joey.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.488
-lt does?
-Yeah.

18:02.897 --> 18:05.664
And l think she really likes him
because he smells like you.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.270
And she-- She loves that.

18:07.438 --> 18:08.998
Go figure.

18:10.178 --> 18:15.052
And she<i>'</i>s comforted by him because
she loves her Uncle Joey so much.

18:15.254 --> 18:19.092
-Really? She loves me?
-Oh, yeah.

18:19.329 --> 18:22.267
But you know what?
lf you need Huggsy, don<i>'</i>t worry.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.636
Emma will totally understand.
l won<i>'</i>t, but whatever.

18:25.876 --> 18:30.408
Okay, wait a minute, Rach.
l mean, if....

18:30.586 --> 18:34.218
lf Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then....

18:34.627 --> 18:35.890
Well, she can have him.

18:36.296 --> 18:38.995
Oh, sweet, l knew Uncle Joey
would step up.

18:39.402 --> 18:43.172
-Look, Emma. Look who<i>'</i>s back.
-No, forget it! Forget it! l can<i>'</i>t do it!

18:43.410 --> 18:46.280
Are you--? You<i>'</i>re gonna take
Huggsy away from a little child?

18:46.483 --> 18:48.886
How do you think l got him
in the first place?

18:52.128 --> 18:56.466
And then it just gobbled up that puke.
l mean....

18:56.638 --> 18:59.404
That was one gross pigeon.

18:59.810 --> 19:03.112
Oh, man. Why didn't l ask Joey
to keep us apart?

19:03.585 --> 19:07.889
You throw a meatball in the hallway,
we'd be doing it like rabbits right now.

19:09.262 --> 19:11.597
All right, you two.
l'm gonna go to the bathroom.

19:11.768 --> 19:14.432
l don<i>'</i>t want anything going
on while l'm gone.

19:14.607 --> 19:16.577
Here<i>'</i>s a few things you can discuss:

19:16.744 --> 19:20.980
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.

19:24.527 --> 19:25.961
l<i>'</i>ve missed you so much.

19:26.163 --> 19:30.001
l won't ask you to get back together.
l know we want different things, but....

19:30.171 --> 19:32.768
-Just to be with you one more night.
-l want that too.

19:32.943 --> 19:37.111
-But is that gonna make it too hard?
-lt can<i>'</i>t be any harder than this.

19:37.318 --> 19:41.452
l mean, if l had known the last time
l saw you would be the last time, l--

19:41.627 --> 19:44.622
l would have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.997
Everything about you.

19:47.171 --> 19:51.236
lf l had known the last time l kissed
you would be the last time...

19:51.413 --> 19:53.884
...l never would have stopped.

19:55.187 --> 19:57.715
Kiss him, you fool!

19:58.394 --> 20:00.831
-What?
-Didn<i>'</i>t you hear that speech?

20:00.999 --> 20:03.231
lf you don<i>'</i>t kiss him, then l will.

20:04.005 --> 20:06.568
l missed you so much.

20:07.178 --> 20:10.777
-l knew you<i>'</i>d be here!
-Crap.

20:10.952 --> 20:14.790
-Who is this?
-My friend Manny.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.955
l asked him to keep me away from you.

20:18.601 --> 20:22.974
-Hey, that<i>'</i>s what l'm doing for Phoebe.
-Well, you<i>'</i>re not doing a very good job.

20:23.578 --> 20:25.707
-Excuse me?
-What<i>'</i>s with the kissing?

20:25.916 --> 20:28.443
Hey, at least l knew
where my guy was.

20:28.621 --> 20:31.787
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee all the kissing.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.460
-You didn<i>'</i>t hear the speech.
-l<i>'</i>ve heard the speech.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.901
lf he knew it was gonna
be the last time--

20:38.073 --> 20:40.441
Hey, it was very moving.
You<i>'</i>re just heartless!

20:40.645 --> 20:43.013
-You<i>'</i>re weak!
-You<i>'</i>re weird!

20:43.250 --> 20:45.881
Your pants are undone.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.690
Where<i>'</i>d they go?

20:51.601 --> 20:55.005
-Damn it.
-Well, we blew it.

20:55.174 --> 20:57.337
l blame myself.

20:57.779 --> 20:59.772
And l blame you too.

21:06.196 --> 21:09.931
lt<i>'</i>s been an hour, and not one
of my classmates has shown up?

21:10.137 --> 21:14.943
l tell you, when l actually die, some
people are gonna get seriously haunted.

21:16.551 --> 21:18.521
There you go. Someone came.

21:18.721 --> 21:20.918
Okay. Okay. l'm gonna go hide.

21:21.092 --> 21:24.554
This is so exciting. My first mourner!

21:27.673 --> 21:30.007
Hi. Glad you could come.

21:30.177 --> 21:33.776
-Please come in.
-Hi. You<i>'</i>re Chandler Bing, right?

21:33.985 --> 21:38.392
-l'm Tom Gordon. l was in your class.
-Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

21:38.561 --> 21:42.261
Thanks. l'm so sorry
about Ross, it<i>'</i>s....

21:42.435 --> 21:45.100
No, at least he died doing
what he loved.

21:45.274 --> 21:47.575
Watching blimps.

21:52.956 --> 21:55.449
-Who is it?
-You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

21:55.729 --> 21:57.095
l don<i>'</i>t remember him.

21:57.264 --> 22:00.965
But then again,
l touched so many lives.

22:03.276 --> 22:04.802
So did you know Ross well?

22:04.980 --> 22:08.146
Actually, l barely knew him.
l came because l heard Chandler's news.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.951
Do you know if he<i>'</i>s seeing anyone?

22:14.600 --> 22:19.668
-Yes, he is. Me.
-What? You mean--?

22:21.981 --> 22:26.787
Can l ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close?

22:27.993 --> 22:30.293
Okay, Tommy!
That<i>'</i>s enough mourning for you.

22:30.464 --> 22:33.835
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

22:34.005 --> 22:37.809
-Hey, listen. Call me.
-Okay.

22:40.117 --> 22:44.923
-l'm dead and no one cares?
-l look like a man?

22:45.394 --> 22:48.332
Please, one ridiculous problem
at a time.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.267
This isn<i>'</i>t ridiculous.
Look around, no one<i>'</i>s here.

22:51.507 --> 22:55.207
You gave them one day<i>'</i>s notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.

22:55.380 --> 22:58.876
And Monica, it<i>'</i>s probably
the way you stand!

23:00.090 --> 23:03.426
l guess you<i>'</i>re right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.

23:03.598 --> 23:07.629
l went to that school for four years
and l didn<i>'</i>t have an impact on anyone?

23:07.806 --> 23:11.108
Well, that<i>'</i>s not true.
You had an impact on me.

23:11.279 --> 23:13.978
l mean, it<i>'</i>s 1 5 years later
and we<i>'</i>re still best friends.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.884
Doesn<i>'</i>t that count for something?

23:20.832 --> 23:24.202
Oh, great, more party boys
for Chandler.

23:24.438 --> 23:28.139
l'm sure it<i>'</i>s somebody for you.
Now go hide.

23:31.854 --> 23:35.486
Hi. l'm here for Ross Geller<i>'</i>s
memorial service.

23:36.296 --> 23:39.861
-Kori? Kori Weston?
-Yeah.

23:40.370 --> 23:43.137
-You look amazing.
-And you are?

23:43.343 --> 23:46.874
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And l'm not gay. l'm not gay at all.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.044
You are married, though.

23:49.255 --> 23:52.455
Don<i>'</i>t listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.

23:55.969 --> 23:59.534
l can<i>'</i>t believe that Ross is gone.
lt is just so sad.

23:59.776 --> 24:01.803
l didn<i>'</i>t know Ross and you
were so close.

24:02.014 --> 24:05.852
Oh, we weren<i>'</i>t. But we had one class
together. He was such a great guy.

24:06.022 --> 24:09.587
And he talked so passionately
about science.

24:09.796 --> 24:13.394
-l always remembered him.
-l'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

24:13.571 --> 24:15.369
And if heaven has a door...

24:15.541 --> 24:19.344
...l'm sure he<i>'</i>s pressing his ear
up against it and listening intently.

24:21.185 --> 24:25.182
l thought so many times about
calling him and asking him out.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.227
l guess l really missed my chance.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.932
No, you didn<i>'</i>t!

24:31.740 --> 24:34.370
l'm still alive!

24:35.347 --> 24:37.476
Who did we bury?

24:38.320 --> 24:40.814
Kori, l know this
is a big surprise for you.

24:41.025 --> 24:45.159
lt<i>'</i>s a long story. But the things you
just said really made my day.

24:45.334 --> 24:47.497
The fact that you<i>'</i>re here
means more to me...

24:47.672 --> 24:50.404
...than if this room were filled
with people.

24:51.045 --> 24:53.539
You sick freak! Who does that?

24:53.718 --> 24:56.519
l can<i>'</i>t believe l had a crush on you.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.631
Did you hear that?

25:02.802 --> 25:06.503
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

25:13.423 --> 25:16.863
No, Mom, l am not dead.

25:17.297 --> 25:20.566
l know it<i>'</i>s not something
to kid about.

25:21.272 --> 25:25.646
lt was just a practical joke between
Chandler and me, but it<i>'</i>s over, okay?

25:26.149 --> 25:30.921
Actually, no. Even if l had died,
you would not be left childless.

25:32.261 --> 25:34.390
