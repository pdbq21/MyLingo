WEBVTT

00:02.990 --> 00:04.584
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:04.752 --> 00:07.348
Honey, I got us that room at the
Woodford Inn this weekend.

00:07.555 --> 00:11.187
That place in Vermont?
You can take a hint.

00:11.358 --> 00:13.750
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.

00:13.921 --> 00:15.275
We're having a party.

00:15.442 --> 00:17.355
Can't you have the party
when we get back?

00:17.925 --> 00:20.487
No. It won't be her real birthday.

00:20.648 --> 00:25.647
Gee, if only she were 1 and had
no idea what the hell a birthday was.

00:26.013 --> 00:28.370
Come on, you guys,
this is really important to us.

00:28.536 --> 00:31.416
Sorry, but Chandler and I
could really use a weekend away...

00:31.579 --> 00:35.495
...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
- There's this thing I really want us to do.

00:35.663 --> 00:37.461
I read about it in Maxim.

00:38.626 --> 00:41.507
Well, can't you just go
to Vermont the next day?

00:41.669 --> 00:43.342
Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

00:43.511 --> 00:48.510
As much as I hate to delay your doing
weird sex stuff to my little sister.

00:48.676 --> 00:51.192
And, I mean, you know, you guys,
this is a big deal.

00:51.358 --> 00:55.321
How can we have her first birthday party
without her aunt and her uncle?

00:55.482 --> 00:58.796
All right, we'll stay.
We can just drive up after the party.

00:58.966 --> 01:02.086
Fine. But if we end up not doing
this Maxim thing because of this party...

01:02.249 --> 01:04.607
Believe me, that is not why
we won't be doing that.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.326
The One With the Cake

01:43.250 --> 01:45.721
You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
on my birthday...

01:45.893 --> 01:48.933
...my daddy would hide a present
in every room of the house.

01:49.096 --> 01:51.977
And then he would draw a treasure map
to help me find them all.

01:52.499 --> 01:55.141
I love family traditions like that.

01:55.302 --> 01:58.342
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...

01:58.506 --> 02:02.549
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.

02:05.112 --> 02:06.513
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

02:06.674 --> 02:09.589
- I brought the camera for Emma's video.
- Oh, good!

02:09.757 --> 02:12.148
We had this idea to make
a birthday video for Emma...

02:12.319 --> 02:14.961
...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
- Oh, cool.

02:15.122 --> 02:17.354
- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

02:17.525 --> 02:20.884
Oh, just think, she's gonna be
watching that video on a TV...

02:21.048 --> 02:23.611
...that hasn't even been invented yet...

02:23.771 --> 02:27.848
...with friends who, right now,
are just, like, babies.

02:28.015 --> 02:31.728
And they'll be living in a floating city
that the humans built...

02:31.899 --> 02:33.458
...to escape the ant people.

02:35.783 --> 02:37.980
That's the hope.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.943
- So is Emma awake yet?
- No, it's still naptime.

02:42.109 --> 02:43.829
- But she'll be up soon.
- Where's Joey?

02:43.991 --> 02:46.109
I said, it's still naptime.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.315
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
- Hey.

02:50.477 --> 02:53.358
Hey, say something to Emma
on her 18th birthday.

02:55.162 --> 02:57.998
- Eighteen, huh?
- Joey, no!

02:58.165 --> 03:01.605
What? What? It's for her hot friends.

03:01.769 --> 03:03.807
When they see this, you'll be 52.

03:03.971 --> 03:07.046
And starting to think about
settling down.

03:07.214 --> 03:10.448
Joey, will you please set this up
for people to put Emma's presents on?

03:11.018 --> 03:12.498
Love to. Yeah.

03:14.301 --> 03:17.421
- We were supposed to bring presents?
- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.

03:17.585 --> 03:19.782
Oh, yeah.
How was I supposed to know?

03:19.947 --> 03:23.067
- Joey, it's a birthday party.
- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.

03:23.230 --> 03:27.626
What's the point? The other day
she laughed for an hour at a cup.

03:27.795 --> 03:31.473
Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it,
dressed as a farmer.

03:31.639 --> 03:37.116
And he's standing next to this cow,
and the cow says, "El-moo."

03:40.367 --> 03:44.159
Man, that's a funny cup.

03:46.453 --> 03:47.968
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:48.135 --> 03:50.891
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Oh, she's still napping.

03:51.058 --> 03:55.773
She was probably up all night excited
about the party she knows is happening.

03:55.943 --> 03:59.622
I know you guys really want to get to
Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.

03:59.787 --> 04:03.625
But it really is to us, okay? Emma
will never have a first birthday again.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.865
You're right. We're sorry.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.230
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!

04:08.395 --> 04:10.912
She didn't sleep well last night,
so we can't wake her.

04:11.078 --> 04:13.355
Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?

04:17.124 --> 04:19.595
- Hi!
- Hey!

04:19.767 --> 04:22.887
- I'm so glad you came.
- I can't believe Emma's already 1.

04:23.050 --> 04:25.202
I remember your first birthday.

04:25.372 --> 04:28.208
Ross was jealous of all the attention
we were giving you.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.336
He pulled on his testicles so hard...

04:31.498 --> 04:34.334
...we had to take him
to the emergency room.

04:37.585 --> 04:40.181
There's something you didn't know
about your dad.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.104
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
Let me help you with that.

04:44.311 --> 04:47.306
- Thank you.
- Oh, man, this is great, huh?

04:47.474 --> 04:50.868
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?

04:51.038 --> 04:55.274
If we gave this present to Emma
from all of us.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.599
Which one are you?

05:03.811 --> 05:07.774
- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
- I know. What are we gonna do?

05:08.936 --> 05:10.690
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

05:10.858 --> 05:15.140
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.

05:16.343 --> 05:19.463
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.620
I'm not going to Vermont
with this Monica.

05:23.831 --> 05:25.551
Hey, Pheebs? You know what?

05:25.713 --> 05:27.546
I was thinking
since you wrote a song...

05:27.715 --> 05:30.551
...maybe I could do something
for Emma using my talents.

05:30.718 --> 05:33.188
So you're gonna hit on her?

05:34.762 --> 05:37.677
No, no, no. My talents as an actor.

05:37.845 --> 05:39.883
You know, I could, like, maybe...

05:40.047 --> 05:43.247
I could do a dramatic reading
of one of her books.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.531
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.

05:46.894 --> 05:50.173
- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
- Oh, Emma might like what?

05:50.337 --> 05:52.774
- My present.
- What did you get her?

05:52.940 --> 05:55.582
- We prepared performances.
- Separate performances.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.895
But equally real.

05:58.065 --> 05:59.898
That sounds like fun.

06:00.067 --> 06:04.623
People are getting a little antsy waiting
for Emma to wake up from her nap.

06:04.792 --> 06:07.069
So would you mind
performing them once now?

06:07.234 --> 06:08.749
- Sure, yeah!
- Okay.

06:08.916 --> 06:12.355
Okay. All right. Everybody,
let's get this party started.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.320
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
a little something for us.

06:15.482 --> 06:17.076
Oh, great.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.920
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
having nothing prepared?

06:20.127 --> 06:24.569
I do it every week with three cameras
pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.210
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

06:28.375 --> 06:32.452
I will be doing a dramatic reading
of one of Emma's books.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.774
Oh, okay. Which one?

06:35.943 --> 06:38.540
Well, it's one of her favorites.

06:39.707 --> 06:44.148
"Riding the Storm Out:
Coping With Postpartum Depression."

06:47.955 --> 06:49.549
Love You Forever.

06:52.079 --> 06:57.682
"Love You Forever, by Robert Munsch.
Published by Firefly Books. Printed...

06:57.845 --> 06:59.199
...in Mexico.

07:04.732 --> 07:08.284
A mother held her new baby
and very slowly rocked him...

07:08.455 --> 07:13.295
...back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth.

07:13.460 --> 07:18.665
And while she held him, she sang,
'I'll love you forever.

07:18.826 --> 07:22.743
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living...

07:22.910 --> 07:25.746
...my baby you'll be.'"

07:26.153 --> 07:28.066
"And while he rocked her, he sang:

07:28.235 --> 07:33.109
'I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.273
As long as I'm living...

07:35.442 --> 07:38.677
...my baby you'll be.'"

07:40.047 --> 07:42.165
Oh, wow!

07:42.850 --> 07:44.170
That was amazing.

07:44.371 --> 07:47.172
Thank you so much for that gift.

07:47.975 --> 07:51.050
I was not ready for this today.

07:52.580 --> 07:55.096
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.

07:55.262 --> 07:57.825
- Phoebe has prepared something as well.
- That's right.

07:57.985 --> 08:01.743
I prepared a song for Emma,
from my heart to hers.

08:01.909 --> 08:06.350
For there's no greater gift
than the gift of music.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.214
Is that it?

08:31.378 --> 08:33.450
No, of course not.

08:33.621 --> 08:37.504
No, I've also, you know,
prepared a reading.

08:39.066 --> 08:42.983
"Sex and the Single Mother."

08:43.511 --> 08:46.586
- "Finding your G-spot."
- Oh, no, no, no!

08:48.235 --> 08:50.752
Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday.

08:50.918 --> 08:53.958
Right now, that seems so far away,
17 years.

08:54.121 --> 08:58.916
Yes. You'll be all grown up
by then, and we'll be...

08:59.086 --> 09:01.397
Well, your grandfather and I
might not be here.

09:01.569 --> 09:03.880
That's true. This message
could be coming to you...

09:04.051 --> 09:06.522
...from beyond the grave, Emma.

09:06.694 --> 09:12.217
- After all, my parents died very young.
- And my cholesterol's off the charts.

09:14.261 --> 09:17.097
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.

09:17.264 --> 09:21.102
Okay, cut! Great. Great.
That was just...

09:21.268 --> 09:23.386
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

09:23.551 --> 09:25.942
Ross, don't forget to get a shot
of Emma's cake.

09:26.113 --> 09:28.026
- It's in a box in the fridge.
- Okay, sure.

09:28.195 --> 09:32.158
You're gonna love this cake. I got it
from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.

09:32.319 --> 09:35.473
Oh, my God, that place has
the creamiest frosting!

09:35.643 --> 09:37.795
I used to hitchhike there
when I was a kid.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.201
Well, anyway, they make
these great novelty cakes...

09:43.370 --> 09:47.653
...in all different shapes. And if you give
them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.

09:47.815 --> 09:51.937
- Did you do a picture of Emma?
- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.

09:52.099 --> 09:55.778
Rach? Does this bakery
by any chance also bake...

09:55.943 --> 09:57.377
...erotic cakes?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.104
Say, for bachelorette parties?

10:01.268 --> 10:04.343
Ross, what are you talking...?
Oh, my God!

10:04.512 --> 10:06.789
They put my baby's face on a penis!

10:09.877 --> 10:12.519
Now it's a party!

10:13.320 --> 10:15.199
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.

10:15.362 --> 10:18.563
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
I would have baked it myself!

10:20.007 --> 10:22.683
Is it okay that I still think
it looks delicious?

10:25.292 --> 10:28.971
- Jack, look at this.
- I know what you're thinking, Judy.

10:29.136 --> 10:32.256
The resemblance is uncanny.

10:34.862 --> 10:38.175
I am this close to tugging
on my testicles again.

10:40.067 --> 10:43.062
No, no, this is not what I ordered,
okay?

10:43.230 --> 10:47.022
I went all the way to New Jersey
so that I could have the perfect cake...

10:47.194 --> 10:50.952
...for my daughter's birthday.
And I need a bunny cake right now!

10:51.158 --> 10:54.871
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...

10:55.042 --> 10:57.605
...so we could put it on the bunny.

10:57.765 --> 11:00.235
That is a weird sentence.

11:01.288 --> 11:04.568
Oh, believe you me,
I am going to bring this cake back.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.929
I don't even want it in my home.
Don't touch it!

11:07.094 --> 11:09.007
I'm so confused!

11:10.177 --> 11:13.490
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!

11:13.661 --> 11:16.097
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
with nuts!

11:16.263 --> 11:17.983
To be fair, this one does have nuts.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.068
Mon, it was nice of you
to loan Rachel your car...

11:26.233 --> 11:29.433
...so she could get the cake.
- It was nice of her to pull my hair...

11:29.597 --> 11:31.156
...till I dropped the key.

11:32.039 --> 11:35.114
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...

11:35.282 --> 11:38.676
...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay?

11:38.846 --> 11:41.408
Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.

11:41.569 --> 11:43.367
Are you still enjoying your nap?

11:46.654 --> 11:48.965
We're Aunt Monica
and Uncle Chandler, by the way.

11:49.136 --> 11:50.411
You may not recognize us...

11:50.578 --> 11:53.937
...because we haven't spoken
to your parents in 17 years.

11:54.101 --> 11:55.376
We used to be married.

11:55.543 --> 11:59.221
But then we missed a weekend away
together, and things kind of unraveled...

11:59.386 --> 12:01.778
...because of you.

12:01.949 --> 12:04.067
Happy birthday.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.909
Ross, Rachel promised
it would be over by now.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.465
We seriously have to go
if we want to get to Vermont.

12:09.637 --> 12:13.634
- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
- And I have a massage client soon.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.271
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.

12:16.443 --> 12:19.006
I promise, Rachel will be back
with the cake any minute.

12:19.166 --> 12:22.606
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?

12:22.770 --> 12:25.002
All right, five more minutes.

12:27.334 --> 12:28.894
Hello?

12:29.056 --> 12:30.969
Oh, no, what happened?

12:31.138 --> 12:33.814
Okay, okay, where are you?

12:33.981 --> 12:36.019
Okay, I'll be right there.

12:36.183 --> 12:37.698
Was that Emma? Is she up?

12:38.986 --> 12:40.785
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.

12:40.948 --> 12:43.305
She forgot her license.
I have to bring it to her.

12:43.470 --> 12:48.310
- Lf you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!

12:48.475 --> 12:50.548
We've been complaining the longest!

12:51.358 --> 12:54.000
No, wait, you guys.
No, you can't leave.

12:54.161 --> 12:56.472
Rachel already feels bad
that the cake's messed up.

12:56.644 --> 12:59.684
How do you think she'll feel
when she comes back and you're gone?

12:59.847 --> 13:02.283
I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.

13:03.691 --> 13:07.243
Joey, you're in charge, okay?
You make sure nobody leaves.

13:07.414 --> 13:09.247
Got it!

13:10.417 --> 13:12.330
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

13:12.499 --> 13:13.775
To the bathroom.

13:13.941 --> 13:18.223
Well, the rest of you get comfortable,
because we are gonna be here for a...

13:18.385 --> 13:23.339
- Wait, there's a window in there.
- No! He's not getting away that easy!

13:24.351 --> 13:27.586
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

13:33.641 --> 13:36.602
Well, that one did not have
Emma's face on it.

13:36.764 --> 13:38.403
- No, it did not.
- No.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.520
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.

13:41.689 --> 13:45.048
Jack can't drive at night anymore.
He has trouble staying in his lane.

13:45.212 --> 13:49.004
Last winter I went up on a church lawn
and drove right through a manger scene.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.408
The papers thought it was
a hate crime.

13:55.262 --> 13:57.699
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
- Okay.

13:57.865 --> 13:59.937
- Bye. Bye, dear.
- Nighty-night.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.225
- Nighty-night.
- Bye.

14:02.389 --> 14:04.906
- How could you just let them leave?
- Hey, hey, hey.

14:05.072 --> 14:08.785
I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
a great man. He fought for our country.

14:08.956 --> 14:12.156
No, he didn't. He pretended to be
a Quaker to get out of korea.

14:13.801 --> 14:18.561
Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
I'm locking you guys in.

14:18.726 --> 14:22.119
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?

14:22.289 --> 14:24.647
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.

14:29.737 --> 14:32.207
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

14:32.379 --> 14:35.454
- Hey.
- So how'd your audition go today?

14:35.623 --> 14:38.823
- What audition?
- The one I told you about last week.

14:38.986 --> 14:41.981
What? You never said anything
about an audition.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.908
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.

14:49.757 --> 14:51.636
I think you can still make it.

14:51.799 --> 14:55.591
It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
need to have a monologue prepared.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.433
A monologue? I don't have a...

15:01.488 --> 15:03.607
I got it.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.650
So I'm gonna take off.

15:06.814 --> 15:09.330
- What?
- No, wait! You don't get to leave.

15:09.496 --> 15:12.491
I've got a massage client waiting
outside my door any minute.

15:12.660 --> 15:15.495
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!

15:15.703 --> 15:17.137
Well, okay, now...

15:17.304 --> 15:19.662
...only one of us has to stay
with Emma.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.063
Okay, and as the person
who realized that, I get to go.

15:23.230 --> 15:25.063
No, no, no. No. No.

15:25.232 --> 15:28.033
Let's figure out a fair way
to decide who's staying.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.108
Oh, I got it.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.238
Okay, everyone pick a number from
one to 10, all right?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.792
Whoever gets the highest number
gets to go first.

15:37.965 --> 15:40.242
- Okay, 10.
- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.683
Anyone else?

15:43.250 --> 15:45.402
- No, let's just draw straws.
- Okay.

15:45.573 --> 15:47.805
Or we could flip a coin
and multiply the answer...

15:47.975 --> 15:50.411
- I'm begging you to stop.
- Right.

15:50.578 --> 15:53.937
Okay, how about this?
We got wind-up toys for Emma.

15:54.101 --> 15:57.335
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.

15:57.545 --> 15:59.663
Yeah, let's do that!

15:59.907 --> 16:02.629
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!

16:03.030 --> 16:06.504
- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
- Okay. I want the dolphin!

16:06.674 --> 16:09.669
- That's a bear!
- I'm too excited!

16:10.317 --> 16:13.073
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.198
- Oh, yeah.
- And Chandler and I get the dog.

16:15.362 --> 16:19.599
And the race is going to go
from here to here.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.887
Now, the one who comes in last stays!

16:23.050 --> 16:25.122
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
wind your toys.

16:25.292 --> 16:29.335
- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
- Go! Go!

16:29.496 --> 16:31.774
Come on, robot!

16:32.940 --> 16:36.140
What are you barking at?

16:40.868 --> 16:43.145
Well, how is that gonna help?

16:43.511 --> 16:47.143
I bought you! How did I forget
that that's all you do?

16:47.474 --> 16:49.547
Way to go, robot!

16:49.877 --> 16:52.268
Good job, Alan.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.957
- Hey, good race, you guys.
- Yeah, see you later.

16:55.122 --> 16:57.035
No. No, no. Wait.

16:57.204 --> 16:58.559
We didn't lose.

16:58.966 --> 17:03.122
The rules clearly stated that the last one
to cross the finish line was the loser.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.330
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically...

17:06.534 --> 17:08.412
They left.

17:13.621 --> 17:16.582
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're gonna come home.

17:17.064 --> 17:19.341
Everybody left?

17:20.187 --> 17:25.027
All right. Well, just tell Emma that
we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.

17:25.953 --> 17:27.786
- Rachel!
- Oh, God, sorry!

17:27.955 --> 17:31.234
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.194
- Emma's awake.
- Yeah?

17:36.363 --> 17:37.957
I can't believe this.

17:38.125 --> 17:41.438
This is her first birthday, she's awake,
we're not even there.

17:41.609 --> 17:44.729
Everybody left. We still have
this stupid obscene cake.

17:44.892 --> 17:48.285
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
try to turn it into something else.

17:48.455 --> 17:51.018
Oh, don't even bother.

17:51.178 --> 17:53.536
We've already ruined
her first birthday.

17:53.701 --> 17:57.744
And do you know how important these
early experiences are, Ross? Very!

17:57.905 --> 18:00.786
According to the back cover
of that book that you gave me.

18:01.949 --> 18:04.226
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.

18:05.753 --> 18:07.346
I guess.

18:08.195 --> 18:13.594
Oh, I just had such an idea of what
this day would be like, you know?

18:13.761 --> 18:15.833
Emma laughing...

18:16.003 --> 18:19.966
...and everybody gathered around
her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."

18:20.167 --> 18:24.802
And then we would all... Hey, get out
of the road, you stupid student driver!

18:26.133 --> 18:27.408
They have to learn.

18:30.217 --> 18:31.538
- Hey.
- What?

18:31.699 --> 18:33.737
This is not bad.

18:33.901 --> 18:38.502
Oh, my God. Look, you made it
into a bunny. How did you do that?

18:38.666 --> 18:41.627
Well, I just made these
two things cheeks.

18:43.551 --> 18:46.910
And then I split this to make ears.

18:47.434 --> 18:49.587
Well, I am very impressed.

18:49.757 --> 18:51.556
Some can sing, some can dance.

18:51.719 --> 18:55.112
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
into woodland creatures.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.687
Now, another way to organize
your stuffed animals is by size.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.730
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma
or for Monica?

19:05.893 --> 19:07.486
Game?

19:07.655 --> 19:11.857
Emma, do you even know it's
your birthday today? You're 1.

19:12.019 --> 19:14.661
One year old. That's little.

19:17.464 --> 19:19.537
That's my girl.

19:20.347 --> 19:22.625
That's how old you are.

19:22.790 --> 19:26.069
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?

19:28.516 --> 19:30.109
I want one.

19:31.318 --> 19:33.231
Me too.

19:37.645 --> 19:41.163
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?

19:41.689 --> 19:43.647
- And head to Canada.
- I was kidding.

19:43.811 --> 19:45.211
I wasn't. Let's get going.

19:46.974 --> 19:49.775
- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
- No, not yet.

19:49.937 --> 19:53.489
- Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
- What about your massage client?

19:53.661 --> 19:58.420
I just felt so bad missing this. So I just
slipped him a little something, you know.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.626
As long as I'm back in five
or six hours, it'll be all right.

20:03.631 --> 20:05.031
Okay.

20:05.192 --> 20:09.269
If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
here the whole time. The whole time.

20:10.317 --> 20:12.675
I've been here the whole time.

20:13.280 --> 20:17.072
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.

20:18.085 --> 20:21.923
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad
that you're here. Thanks, you guys.

20:22.409 --> 20:24.801
Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
what Emma just did.

20:24.972 --> 20:27.124
- What?
- Emma, how old are you?

20:27.294 --> 20:28.968
How old are you today?

20:32.740 --> 20:35.780
Emma, that's right. You're that many.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.506
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.

20:39.747 --> 20:41.420
- This means...
- No! No science camp!

20:41.589 --> 20:46.030
Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.

20:46.193 --> 20:51.751
Oh, and, Emma, look at your
stuffed animals lined up so neatly.

20:52.079 --> 20:53.799
Thanks.

20:54.121 --> 20:57.116
Okay, here we go.

20:57.525 --> 21:01.681
Emma's first birthday cake.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.249
Go ahead, Emma,
blow out the candle.

21:04.411 --> 21:06.882
Come on, Emma. You can do it.

21:07.054 --> 21:10.049
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, nothing.

21:10.217 --> 21:12.654
These are happy tears.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.972
This is just what I wanted.

21:16.423 --> 21:18.302
Hey, you made it into a bunny.

21:20.427 --> 21:23.662
What is wrong with me? It looked
more delicious when it was a penis.

21:30.397 --> 21:31.991
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

21:32.159 --> 21:34.960
- And record.
- Okay.

21:35.122 --> 21:39.324
Hi, Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over, and...

21:39.486 --> 21:41.479
Go! Go! Come on!

21:41.689 --> 21:44.046
Go! Go! Come on!

21:44.211 --> 21:48.254
Go! Go, Alan!
Run, you hairy bastard!

21:51.699 --> 21:52.689
