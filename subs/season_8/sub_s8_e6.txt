WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:04.395
-Guys, guess what?
-What?

00:04.671 --> 00:07.538
We're having a Halloween party!

00:07.774 --> 00:08.900
-Good!
-Great!

00:09.175 --> 00:13.271
-You have to wear a costume.
-I can't make it.

00:13.546 --> 00:15.241
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:15.482 --> 00:20.442
I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.178
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

00:24.424 --> 00:27.291
Not two years in a row.

00:28.294 --> 00:31.695
-I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
-You have to.

00:31.931 --> 00:37.631
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

00:37.904 --> 00:40.634
You're an actor.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.336
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

00:43.510 --> 00:45.944
-I will.
-The girl from the wedding?

00:47.414 --> 00:51.510
If she needs costume ideas,
she could be a bikini model..

00:51.785 --> 00:55.277
or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

00:55.522 --> 01:01.518
Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw
Massacre. No! Slutty Leatherface.

01:02.629 --> 01:05.928
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?

01:06.166 --> 01:09.033
That's right, he was hitting on her.

01:09.302 --> 01:14.001
And I got her. I guess
the better man won.

01:14.274 --> 01:17.334
Please don't take her from me.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.149
Ursula!

02:00.420 --> 02:02.945
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

02:03.189 --> 02:06.590
I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.987
Wait a second!

02:08.228 --> 02:10.253
So, what's new with you?

02:10.930 --> 02:14.229
Nothing.
I'm getting married next week.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.957
What?

02:16.236 --> 02:19.399
It'll be a small ceremony.
Just family.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.901
His.

02:22.675 --> 02:24.108
Okay.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.902
I'm happy for you.

02:26.446 --> 02:31.076
Wait. If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.443
-Really?
-Sure.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.313
You could be my sister for the day.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.682
Yeah, okay.

02:38.958 --> 02:43.691
My friends are having a party tonight,
so you could come.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.158
Maybe I could meet the guy.

02:46.432 --> 02:49.333
Well, I'm supposed to work tonight.

02:49.602 --> 02:53.299
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

02:53.573 --> 02:57.669
-It's a costume party.
-So that's why you're..

02:58.578 --> 02:59.943
No.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.444
But thanks.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.655
-You're supposed to wear a costume.
-I am.

03:11.891 --> 03:16.385
I am a woman who spent money
on a dress she wants to wear..

03:16.629 --> 03:20.190
because soon she won't
fit into it.

03:20.466 --> 03:24.800
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.735
-Trick or treat!
-Can I give out candy?

03:29.008 --> 03:33.911
I want to be with kids. Since I got
pregnant, I have maternal instincts.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.048
-Trick or treat!
-Just a minute!

03:42.989 --> 03:44.854
Look at you guys!

03:45.124 --> 03:49.618
-Wow! You are a very scary witch.
-Thank you.

03:49.862 --> 03:53.730
-And you are a very funny clown.
-Thank you.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.332
And you..

03:55.568 --> 03:59.060
are so in style right now.

03:59.339 --> 04:04.641
I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line
has got this equestrian theme.

04:04.877 --> 04:09.780
-Did you see the cover of Vogue..?
-Could I just have the candy?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.181
Sure.

04:21.961 --> 04:25.260
Catwoman. So we meet again.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.431
So we do, Supergirl.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.668
It's me, Phoebe.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.666
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

04:41.414 --> 04:43.439
I appreciate the costume.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.911
You did this to him?

04:46.185 --> 04:47.777
I thought he'd love it.

04:48.054 --> 04:54.220
-He loves The Velveteen Rabbit.
-That rabbit was brown and white.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.725
It was pink, or no bunny at all.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.899
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

05:03.069 --> 05:08.200
-You didn't dress up either?
-Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.913
Dude, what happened?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.809
How is that me?

05:18.084 --> 05:20.348
I'm Chandler.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.081
That is so you!

05:24.324 --> 05:28.818
-When have I ever done that?
-When have I ever done that?

05:32.432 --> 05:34.457
Trick or treat.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.607
-You're the prettiest ballerina ever.
-Thank you.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.441
That deserves another candy.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.637
Thank you.

05:50.883 --> 05:54.478
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.281
I love you!

05:59.359 --> 06:01.793
Honey, here, take it all.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.791
Monica? We need more candy.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.628
-There's only been four kids.
-I know.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.568
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.707
No wonder you're pregnant.

06:23.783 --> 06:30.018
-What are you supposed to be?
-Remember the satellite, Sputnik?

06:30.823 --> 06:35.021
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"..

06:35.428 --> 06:38.295
and these are my antenna.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.592
So Sputnik becomes..?

06:45.571 --> 06:49.530
Spud-nik!

06:51.077 --> 06:54.535
Wow! I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.347
All right! Ross came as doodie.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.716
-No, I'm not doodie.
-No, space-doodie.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.393
Okay, I'm Spud-nik.

07:09.729 --> 07:13.893
-You know, like Sputnik.
-What's a Sputnik, doodie-man?

07:21.841 --> 07:22.865
Hey, sweetie.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.875
-Aren't you gonna kiss me?
-Okay.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.606
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.011
-Ursula?
-Ursula's fiance?

07:34.253 --> 07:39.555
You're the sister. I just slapped
my future sister-in-law's ass.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.193
Is your mother here?
I could slap her on the butt.

07:43.429 --> 07:47.422
-My mother killed herself.
-See, and I knew that.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.433
Now I'm sweating.

07:51.704 --> 07:56.767
I'm sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.704
No. We'll start over.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.778
-Hi, I'm Phoebe.
-Eric.

08:02.048 --> 08:06.644
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Sweat's burning my eyes.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.284
-Thank you.
-There.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.216
-What are you?
-There's no name for it.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.553
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

08:15.895 --> 08:20.559
-No, I meant your costume.
-I'm a solar system.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.927
My second graders helped.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.070
-I love the second grade.
-Really?

08:26.272 --> 08:32.074
It's much better than first grade,
and definitely better than third.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.805
With all the politics
and the mind games.

08:36.549 --> 08:41.248
-So, what do you do?
-I'm a masseuse, by day.

08:42.555 --> 08:45.854
-You don't have to stand with me.
-I'm having fun.

08:46.058 --> 08:51.291
-I'm excited for you and Ursula.
-I feel very lucky. She's great.

08:51.564 --> 08:56.263
-She's the most beautiful woman ever.
-Thank you.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.799
-Hey, Joey?
-Yeah?

09:04.076 --> 09:07.944
-You read comic books, right?
-Exclusively.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.672
Who would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

09:11.951 --> 09:14.112
-Catwoman, hands down.
-Yeah.

09:14.353 --> 09:17.720
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give Phoebe the edge.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.721
-What? Really?
-You kidding?

09:19.992 --> 09:25.487
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.393
She's not right behind me, is she?

09:28.668 --> 09:30.295
No, you're fine.

09:30.536 --> 09:33.403
-Could I take Rachel?
-I'm not sure.

09:33.673 --> 09:36.141
What? Come on, I am tough!

09:36.375 --> 09:39.105
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

09:39.345 --> 09:42.746
Relax. Why are you so serious?
It doesn't matter.

09:42.982 --> 09:47.851
Really? What if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.213
I would say, "Woman, please."

09:53.059 --> 09:55.550
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.459
-You think you could take him?
-The dude with the balls on his chest?

09:59.632 --> 10:01.122
I think so.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.996
But what is he doing with my sister?
He's so great.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.764
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

10:07.039 --> 10:13.672
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.040
-Oh, my God, Phoebe?
-What?

10:16.282 --> 10:21.345
-You're getting a crush on him.
-No, I'm not, you are!

10:21.587 --> 10:24.488
Here comes the temper.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.284
Trick or treat.

10:28.928 --> 10:33.058
Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went for more.

10:33.299 --> 10:38.259
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.869
-Can I write you a check?
-Okay.

10:41.107 --> 10:45.942
-Okay. What's your name?
-Lelani Mayolanofavich.

10:47.913 --> 10:51.781
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

10:52.918 --> 10:55.113
-Hi.
-Hi, Mona.

10:57.523 --> 11:02.222
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was
hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.

11:02.461 --> 11:05.555
Actually, I'm just a nurse.

11:06.465 --> 11:10.959
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but I'm maxed out.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.029
-You made it.
-Wait.

11:14.273 --> 11:18.573
-You're a potato?
-Well, I'm a spud..?

11:18.811 --> 11:23.111
-And the antenna.. You're Spud-nik!
-Yes!

11:23.983 --> 11:26.178
Marry her.

11:27.653 --> 11:31.953
Here's a good one. Who'd win
a fight between Ross and Chandler?

11:32.491 --> 11:34.618
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.260
-So Ross?
-Yeah.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.823
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hello, handsome.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.327
Oh, God.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.467
Look at you two.
When did you guys meet?

11:47.640 --> 11:50.074
-Two weeks ago.
-That's it?

11:50.242 --> 11:54.042
I know. It sounds crazy,
and I'm not impulsive, but..

11:54.280 --> 11:58.341
-we have so much in common.
-Oh, really?

11:58.584 --> 12:00.882
We're both teachers.

12:02.755 --> 12:07.158
-And we were both in the Peace Corps.
-Peace Corps, really?

12:08.694 --> 12:14.860
When we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and never met.

12:15.067 --> 12:20.266
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.308
-Shall we get me really drunk?
-Sure.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.179
Howdy, doodie.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.318
That's funny, yeah.

12:34.487 --> 12:39.322
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.992
Relax, man. You're looking
a little flushed.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.593
-Our question might get answered.
-What question?

12:52.838 --> 12:56.330
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,
you or Ross?

12:57.076 --> 13:00.512
-There's no question.
-So you think Ross too?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.783
-You picked Ross?
-Ross is strong.

13:06.018 --> 13:10.751
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

13:11.457 --> 13:15.985
-I can't believe you didn't pick me.
-She's right. I am stronger.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.492
I would destroy you.

13:18.764 --> 13:23.463
Really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

13:24.436 --> 13:27.098
I'll prove it like a theorem!

13:27.306 --> 13:29.467
All right! Stop it!

13:30.543 --> 13:32.841
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

13:33.045 --> 13:36.640
People came to see a fight,
let's give them one!

13:38.751 --> 13:43.051
-You guys could arm-wrestle.
-Listen to the slutty nurse.

13:43.689 --> 13:48.183
-You're going down.
-Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!

13:48.460 --> 13:52.453
Seriously, guys, the trash talk
is embarrassing.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.796
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.871
-You are so sweet.
-Really?

14:01.140 --> 14:05.907
You are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.045
-Got to go.
-Trick or treat.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.042
Hi! Wow! There you go.

14:13.919 --> 14:18.015
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.193
We were, but now we've got candy.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.489
I'd rather have the money.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.527
That's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

14:28.868 --> 14:30.096
This isn't fair.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.668
Is it fair that you put on a cape
and get stuff?

14:33.906 --> 14:35.931
Shut up!

14:36.442 --> 14:37.602
You shut up!

14:39.511 --> 14:43.675
-You can't tell me to shut up.
-I think I just did.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.317
And here it comes again. Shut up!

14:48.053 --> 14:50.749
No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

14:51.957 --> 14:55.825
Wait, I had one more thing to say.
Right. Shut up.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.625
You're a mean old woman.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.695
Wait! Shut.. Don't cry!

15:00.933 --> 15:02.924
Let me get my checkbook!

15:03.202 --> 15:08.265
You don't have to do this. The
strength inside you means the most.

15:08.474 --> 15:12.843
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.842
That's the strength I want in a man.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.278
That means nothing to me. Come on!

15:21.487 --> 15:23.045
-Hi, liar.
-Hey.

15:24.623 --> 15:29.720
He's marrying you because he thinks
the things you were saying were true.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.487
-They could be true.
-But they're not.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.060
It's a fine line.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.765
-Why are you lying?
-I don't know.

15:39.004 --> 15:44.374
He did this stuff, I said I did it too.
He got so excited, it was fun.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.641
You can't do this.
You're gonna ruin his life.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.575
Why are you taking this so seriously?
It's just a marriage.

15:52.584 --> 15:56.145
Besides, if I cheat on him,
I can call it an affair.

15:56.422 --> 15:57.411
Honey?

15:57.856 --> 16:02.486
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

16:02.928 --> 16:05.260
She's helped so many people quit.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.823
We'd better get going.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.934
-You have a church group meeting.
-Right.

16:15.407 --> 16:18.899
-It was nice meeting you.
-You too.

16:19.178 --> 16:23.080
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

16:23.382 --> 16:27.443
Come on! Bunny versus doodie.
We're waiting!

16:29.388 --> 16:32.721
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.221
Wait. What does the winner get?

16:36.428 --> 16:38.419
-Pride.
-And dignity.

16:38.697 --> 16:41.257
Okay, if you say so.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.524
All right, ready, set, go!

16:43.769 --> 16:46.237
-Come on!
-Come on!

16:53.412 --> 16:58.941
-Wow, they're both really strong.
-Or equally weak.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.943
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

17:08.627 --> 17:13.826
-So you getting tired?
-No. I could do this all day.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.465
Yeah. Me too.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.573
-Getting a little tired, though.
-God, I'm exhausted.

17:22.808 --> 17:27.973
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

17:29.148 --> 17:33.244
She's talking to Joey!
You gotta let me win!

17:33.485 --> 17:36.249
Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

17:36.488 --> 17:42.120
At least you have a wife.
I get divorces and knock people up.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.526
And I'm dressed as doodie.

17:47.433 --> 17:53.167
-You're Spud-nik.
-Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.304
Please? She's watching.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.475
-Fine.
-Thanks.

18:01.046 --> 18:04.015
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah!

18:05.184 --> 18:06.879
My hero!

18:07.152 --> 18:09.450
You're a weird lady.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.619
Ursula said she left her purse.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.525
What a relief. It has the numbers
for her prayer chain.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.857
I'm sure it does.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.065
Guess I'll see you at the wedding.

18:26.805 --> 18:30.172
I don't think I'm gonna make it
to the wedding.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.809
I wish you all the luck in the world.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.708
And I also want to give you
a little piece of advice..

18:35.881 --> 18:38.349
that I give to everyone
who's getting married.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.212
Don't trust your wife.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.388
I think we'll be okay.

18:43.622 --> 18:47.956
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.797
-I can't let you do this. She's lying.
-What?

18:54.032 --> 18:58.162
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

18:58.403 --> 19:01.634
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

19:01.874 --> 19:07.312
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

19:07.546 --> 19:12.483
Here's the name tag from
where she works as a waitress.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.982
Not a teacher, a waitress.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.814
Here, she always lies about this.

19:18.056 --> 19:22.755
-How old did she say she was?
-She told me she was 25.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.622
I almost don't want to show you.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.856
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.837
I am so stupid.

19:34.072 --> 19:36.336
Of course she's not a teacher.

19:36.542 --> 19:42.003
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

19:44.149 --> 19:46.379
No, you're not stupid.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.449
I'm not smart.

19:52.691 --> 19:57.355
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.461
-To be romantic.
-Good.

19:59.698 --> 20:05.659
You should be impulsive and romantic.
You did it with the wrong person.

20:08.307 --> 20:12.038
-What?
-It's weird, two people look so alike.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.972
And so different.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.282
Eric! Let's go!

20:19.985 --> 20:24.285
-Better go deal with it.
-Yeah, you should.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.826
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

20:43.976 --> 20:47.707
I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.004
That's not bad.

20:49.281 --> 20:53.274
I also had to go to a few houses
as his girlfriend.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.580
I am awful with children.

20:56.922 --> 21:01.256
You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.951
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

21:05.163 --> 21:07.723
-That's all it is?
-Absolutely.

21:07.966 --> 21:14.599
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.934
They get crazy during the summer too.

21:18.176 --> 21:21.634
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.975
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.683
Look, I'm sorry you lost.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.648
I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.021
Was that a secret, or a lie?

21:39.264 --> 21:41.289
-No, I let him.. Ross?
-Yeah?

21:41.566 --> 21:44.694
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

21:45.304 --> 21:48.569
Chandler "let me win."

21:49.308 --> 21:55.076
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

21:55.314 --> 21:58.408
I am strong. I'll show you.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.083
Chandler, please.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.219
What's the matter? Scared?

22:03.255 --> 22:06.088
Let's go, big bunny!

22:06.391 --> 22:10.054
One, two, three. Go!

22:14.499 --> 22:16.262
I'm gonna kill myself!
