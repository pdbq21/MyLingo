WEBVTT

00:02.644 --> 00:06.119
Do you realize we're getting
married in four weeks?

00:06.367 --> 00:09.284
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

00:09.915 --> 00:12.204
Do you realize you get
louder each week?

00:13.116 --> 00:16.699
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows yet?

00:16.908 --> 00:21.392
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."

00:22.127 --> 00:25.532
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to the wedding.

00:26.929 --> 00:31.899
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

00:32.913 --> 00:36.246
Do you happen to know exactly
what I'm gonna say?

00:37.888 --> 00:40.390
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

00:40.636 --> 00:42.510
Say what's in your heart.

00:49.230 --> 00:52.871
Look at her go. She must love me
more than I love her!

00:53.544 --> 00:57.648
What's wrong with me?
Don't open that door.

00:59.111 --> 01:03.345
The One With The Vows

01:38.878 --> 01:43.433
"Monica, there are no words..."

01:46.010 --> 01:49.271
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

01:49.976 --> 01:54.424
You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

01:54.638 --> 01:58.980
With Carol, I promised never to love
another woman until the day I die.

01:59.266 --> 02:01.033
She made no such promise.

02:01.944 --> 02:06.536
I'm so pathetic. Monica knows what to
say. You should have seen her writing.

02:09.425 --> 02:11.157
What's the emergency?

02:11.373 --> 02:15.441
You have to help me. I'm supposed
to write my vows and all I have is this.

02:15.653 --> 02:19.366
I like the pretty drawing of you
in the wedding dress.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.477
Except your breasts look kind of small.

02:25.534 --> 02:27.822
Those are my eyes!

02:29.569 --> 02:33.175
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

02:35.727 --> 02:39.238
Why don't you just start
with something simple, like:

02:39.450 --> 02:44.622
"Monica, from the moment I met you,
I knew I loved you."

02:44.843 --> 02:46.539
I'm not sure I can do that.

02:46.756 --> 02:49.294
Everyone, this is Chandler.

02:49.505 --> 02:51.557
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

02:52.427 --> 02:53.886
Okay.

02:56.359 --> 02:59.657
Okay, okay.
Maybe you could start with:

02:59.873 --> 03:02.755
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

03:02.935 --> 03:06.233
...there was a part of me
that always knew I wanted more."

03:06.449 --> 03:11.170
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.612
Would you go out with me?

03:18.556 --> 03:20.953
Are we allowed to lie in the vows?

03:22.383 --> 03:24.779
Maybe you don't talk about
your feelings back then.

03:25.027 --> 03:30.199
Just say something about all the things
that he's taught you, like...

03:36.160 --> 03:38.793
Or all the things you taught him.

03:39.431 --> 03:41.578
Everybody knows
the basic erogenous zones.

03:41.796 --> 03:43.848
You got one, two, three...

03:44.058 --> 03:46.347
...four, five...

03:46.564 --> 03:48.640
...six and seven.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.941
There are seven?

03:53.452 --> 03:56.963
- That's one?
- Kind of an important one.

03:57.941 --> 04:00.123
I was looking at it upside down.

04:03.054 --> 04:05.651
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.

04:10.222 --> 04:13.412
Okay, now, start out
with a little one...

04:13.631 --> 04:16.442
...a two, a one-two-three...

04:17.493 --> 04:20.862
...a three, a five...

04:21.947 --> 04:24.687
...a four, a three-two...

04:24.904 --> 04:26.921
...two, a two-four-six.

04:27.896 --> 04:31.537
Two-four-six, four, two...

04:32.175 --> 04:34.393
...two, four-seven...

04:35.516 --> 04:38.220
...five-seven, six-seven...

04:38.437 --> 04:40.904
...seven, seven...

04:41.151 --> 04:44.485
...seven, seven, seven, seven, seven...

04:44.700 --> 04:46.088
...seven!

04:54.894 --> 04:56.970
I got it!
How about saying something like:

04:57.225 --> 05:01.875
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

05:06.758 --> 05:08.703
- Yeah?
- I can't do everything.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.241
Look back over your time together.

05:14.343 --> 05:15.802
Oh, look, twins!

05:16.012 --> 05:19.903
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

05:20.327 --> 05:22.924
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

05:23.145 --> 05:24.426
I'll tell you what.

05:24.641 --> 05:29.991
When we're 40, if neither of us are married,
what do you say you and I have one?

05:30.173 --> 05:33.055
Why wouldn't I be married
when I'm 40?

05:33.269 --> 05:35.345
Oh, no. No, I just
meant hypothetically.

05:35.565 --> 05:38.590
Hypothetically, why won't I
be married when I'm 40?

05:38.836 --> 05:39.904
No, no.

05:40.158 --> 05:44.809
What is it? Seriously, is there something
fundamentally un-marriable about me?

05:45.516 --> 05:47.105
Well?

05:47.325 --> 05:50.516
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

05:52.996 --> 05:54.312
I'm getting married today!

05:57.832 --> 05:59.849
Do you think he knew I was here?

06:07.052 --> 06:08.120
Nice try.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.142
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:13.176 --> 06:14.350
Look, Monica...

06:18.881 --> 06:22.286
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this will work.

06:30.711 --> 06:33.308
You are so great! I love you.

06:43.026 --> 06:44.236
What?

06:44.592 --> 06:48.483
Nothing! I said, you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

06:50.542 --> 06:53.768
- You said you love me! I can't believe this.
- No, I didn't.

06:55.657 --> 06:58.088
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

06:59.101 --> 07:01.674
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

07:01.884 --> 07:03.651
Stop it! Stop it!

07:07.938 --> 07:11.971
You know, I was thinking,
what if I unpack here?

07:12.495 --> 07:14.571
Then all your stuff would be here.

07:16.148 --> 07:17.464
Well...

07:20.184 --> 07:21.952
What if all my stuff was here?

07:22.654 --> 07:25.608
Then you'd be going back and forth
all the time.

07:26.168 --> 07:27.793
Doesn't make any sense.

07:28.290 --> 07:29.820
Okay.

07:32.222 --> 07:36.077
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

07:45.026 --> 07:46.970
You wanted it to be a surprise.

07:57.307 --> 07:58.801
Oh, my God!

08:05.414 --> 08:06.967
Chandler...

08:08.301 --> 08:10.069
...in all my life...

08:10.876 --> 08:13.651
...I never thought
I would be so lucky...

08:17.208 --> 08:20.719
...as to fall in love with my best...

08:22.218 --> 08:23.772
My best...

08:24.793 --> 08:28.647
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
- Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

08:29.837 --> 08:31.569
I thought...

08:35.926 --> 08:37.455
I can do this.

08:41.318 --> 08:42.848
I thought...

08:43.093 --> 08:48.265
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

08:48.938 --> 08:54.109
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

08:58.158 --> 09:02.500
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

09:05.603 --> 09:07.335
And if you let me...

09:08.213 --> 09:12.317
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

09:21.364 --> 09:22.787
Monica?

09:24.878 --> 09:26.336
Will you marry me?

09:28.531 --> 09:30.191
Yes.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.856
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

09:46.901 --> 09:48.633
Come in! Come in!

09:50.240 --> 09:52.114
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

09:59.808 --> 10:02.964
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

10:03.184 --> 10:06.588
We were helping Chandler write
his vows, but he kicked us out...

10:06.767 --> 10:09.472
...because Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

10:11.498 --> 10:15.318
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass"
inappropriate?

10:17.239 --> 10:18.793
How's Monica doing?

10:19.048 --> 10:22.939
Let's say it's lucky she's got a sweet ass
because she's not so good at the writing.

10:24.337 --> 10:27.184
I can't believe in four weeks
they're gonna be married!

10:27.503 --> 10:29.519
Let's just hope it works.

10:29.764 --> 10:32.505
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

10:32.721 --> 10:34.251
Phoebe, that's not true.

10:34.461 --> 10:36.643
Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?

10:38.601 --> 10:40.748
I can't believe they've
been together 3 years.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.244
That long?

10:42.498 --> 10:45.867
Maybe it seems like less because
they hid it from us for so long.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.524
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

10:56.067 --> 10:58.664
I've had a very long, hard day.

10:59.372 --> 11:03.013
- I'm gonna get some chicken. Want some?
- No, thanks. No, chicken. Bye, then.

11:07.896 --> 11:12.547
Are you okay? I'm sorry. He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.012
Chicken?

11:15.098 --> 11:16.901
I could eat some chicken.

11:18.368 --> 11:19.791
Hey, Joe!

11:22.439 --> 11:26.329
Can I get a three-piece, some coleslaw
and some beans and a Coke?

11:27.309 --> 11:28.733
Diet Coke.

11:32.876 --> 11:37.147
- I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
- It's not like we weren't cool about it.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.246
You? And you?

11:41.052 --> 11:43.590
You cannot tell. No one knows.

11:43.801 --> 11:45.568
How? When?

11:46.132 --> 11:49.228
- It happened in London.
- In London?!

11:51.211 --> 11:54.924
We didn't tell anyone, because we didn't
want to make a big deal out of it.

11:55.178 --> 11:57.325
But it is a big deal!

11:57.822 --> 12:00.218
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

12:00.709 --> 12:02.025
- You can't.
- Please!

12:02.241 --> 12:07.389
We don't want to deal with telling
everyone. Just promise you won't tell.

12:11.008 --> 12:12.361
All right!

12:13.026 --> 12:17.439
I can't wait to be with you. I'll tell
Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours.

12:17.688 --> 12:20.534
Laundry? Is that my new nickname?

12:25.238 --> 12:27.871
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...

12:29.483 --> 12:34.560
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

12:44.999 --> 12:47.431
Chandler and Monica!
Chandler and Monica!

12:47.644 --> 12:49.102
Oh, my God!

12:49.314 --> 12:52.196
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

12:52.445 --> 12:56.087
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

12:56.411 --> 13:00.052
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

13:00.273 --> 13:01.447
I know! I know!

13:01.665 --> 13:03.053
- You know?
- Yes, I know!

13:03.300 --> 13:06.941
And Joey knows, but Ross doesn't know,
so you have to stop screaming!

13:07.162 --> 13:09.274
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi!

13:11.163 --> 13:12.337
What? What?

13:12.555 --> 13:15.580
Oh, God! We're just so excited that
you might get this apartment!

13:16.069 --> 13:20.340
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

13:20.557 --> 13:23.262
Get in here! Come on!

13:26.332 --> 13:29.737
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?

13:30.020 --> 13:32.938
Yes, but you know what? It
doesn't matter who knows what.

13:33.152 --> 13:36.485
Now enough of us know,
that we can just tell them we know.

13:36.666 --> 13:39.548
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

13:39.797 --> 13:44.352
Or we could not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.798
All right, we better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

13:48.355 --> 13:50.229
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:50.477 --> 13:53.075
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

13:58.515 --> 14:01.397
Did you see that? With the
inappropriate and the pinching?

14:01.611 --> 14:02.679
Actually, I did.

14:02.934 --> 14:06.303
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

14:07.526 --> 14:10.551
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she knows about us!

14:10.761 --> 14:14.130
- Phoebe knows about us!
- Well, I didn't tell them.

14:14.519 --> 14:17.224
Them? Who's them?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.987
Phoebe and Joey.

14:22.938 --> 14:24.077
Joey!

14:24.713 --> 14:25.684
And Rachel.

14:26.139 --> 14:28.950
I would've told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

14:29.166 --> 14:32.606
Oh, man. They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

14:32.820 --> 14:35.939
But, see, they don't know that we know
that they know.

14:37.412 --> 14:39.321
- So...
- Ah, yes!

14:39.569 --> 14:42.451
The messers become the messees!

14:43.534 --> 14:47.876
Oh, my God, he wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

14:48.092 --> 14:49.231
Are you kidding?

14:49.450 --> 14:51.952
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

15:00.687 --> 15:03.498
Joey? Do they know that we know?

15:04.062 --> 15:06.245
- No.
- Joey!

15:06.497 --> 15:09.070
- They know you know.
- I knew it!

15:10.116 --> 15:12.192
I cannot believe those two!

15:12.447 --> 15:16.302
They thought that they could mess with
us? They're trying to mess with us?

15:18.501 --> 15:21.870
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

15:23.302 --> 15:25.176
Joey, you can't say anything.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.334
Couldn't if I wanted to.

15:29.251 --> 15:32.347
This is getting out of hand!
She wants me to put lotion on her!

15:32.556 --> 15:33.872
She's bluffing!

15:34.087 --> 15:36.412
She's not backing down.
She went like this:

15:39.514 --> 15:42.396
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

15:45.325 --> 15:47.270
Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?

15:47.482 --> 15:52.594
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler,
the sooner this is all over and in the open.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.193
- I like that.
- Okay.

15:54.371 --> 15:59.092
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

16:06.513 --> 16:09.218
Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.990
It's not my first time.

16:13.402 --> 16:15.976
You go back out there
and seduce her till she cracks.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.952
Okay, give me a second.

16:18.725 --> 16:21.715
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

16:27.597 --> 16:28.877
Oh, you're going?

16:29.302 --> 16:31.283
Not without you, lover.

16:36.365 --> 16:39.520
So this is my bra.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.191
It's very, very nice.

16:47.498 --> 16:49.823
Well, come here.

16:50.246 --> 16:52.916
I'm very happy
we're gonna have all the sex.

16:54.526 --> 16:57.930
You should be. I'm very bendy.

17:02.736 --> 17:06.070
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.

17:26.360 --> 17:29.314
I guess there's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.028
Here it comes.

17:33.005 --> 17:34.594
Our first kiss.

17:43.512 --> 17:47.058
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

17:47.270 --> 17:49.002
- I can't have sex with you.
- Why not?

17:49.218 --> 17:51.958
- Because I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

17:54.472 --> 17:59.549
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

18:04.249 --> 18:06.016
I love you, Monica.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.109
I love you too, Chandler.

18:14.546 --> 18:17.951
I thought you guys were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love.

18:20.113 --> 18:22.687
So that's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

18:22.896 --> 18:26.859
- Well, actually, Ross doesn't.
- We'd appreciate if no one told him yet.

18:27.141 --> 18:28.529
No.

18:30.759 --> 18:33.156
What are you doing?

18:33.891 --> 18:36.666
Get off my sister!

18:38.866 --> 18:42.342
Your friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

18:42.519 --> 18:44.286
You think it'll be that different?

18:44.502 --> 18:47.563
How could it not be?
Soon, they're gonna have kids...

18:47.772 --> 18:51.106
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

18:51.322 --> 18:53.682
And maybe they'll leave the city...

18:53.896 --> 18:56.886
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.331
Things change.

19:01.619 --> 19:04.810
But I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

19:06.491 --> 19:07.950
It'll be okay, Joe.

19:08.578 --> 19:12.220
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

19:12.753 --> 19:14.865
Who's this little naked guy?

19:15.084 --> 19:17.195
That little naked guy would be me.

19:18.807 --> 19:20.539
Look at the little thing.

19:20.755 --> 19:22.178
Yes.

19:23.295 --> 19:27.708
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

19:29.314 --> 19:31.852
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.384
That's Nana right there in the middle.

19:34.602 --> 19:36.963
- Wow.
- Let's see.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.882
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

19:40.100 --> 19:43.646
Monica, you look like your grandmother.
How old was she there?

19:44.066 --> 19:45.762
Let's see, 1939.

19:45.979 --> 19:48.055
Yeah, 24, 25.

19:49.493 --> 19:51.118
Looks like a fun gang.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.268
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

20:00.488 --> 20:02.326
Let me see.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.981
No, that would be me again.

20:11.412 --> 20:14.366
- Hey, you guys.
- What's going on?

20:14.578 --> 20:17.080
Well, we were just talking about...

20:17.326 --> 20:20.552
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

20:20.736 --> 20:24.769
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.449
That's so sweet.

20:28.843 --> 20:32.592
- So we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

20:32.808 --> 20:36.355
Just as long as I don't hear Chandler's
and he doesn't hear mine.

20:45.508 --> 20:47.452
Oh, that's beautiful.

20:48.743 --> 20:50.332
Funny one! That's good!

20:52.431 --> 20:54.056
Monica, will you marry me?

20:56.954 --> 20:58.828
What? I don't get it.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.804
Oh, yeah!

21:03.530 --> 21:06.163
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

21:07.426 --> 21:10.000
Don't worry, honey.
We'll make yours funnier.

21:16.994 --> 21:18.903
Okay, what do you guys think?

21:21.309 --> 21:25.722
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

21:26.632 --> 21:29.170
- You really like it?
- Dude!

21:30.667 --> 21:32.364
How did you write this?

21:32.581 --> 21:35.154
I stole Monica's
and changed the name.

21:37.661 --> 21:40.994
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first, he can!
