WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:06.741
So your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

00:07.587 --> 00:10.249
I was 15.
It was my best friend, Ruth.

00:10.456 --> 00:12.856
And we got drunk
on that hard cider.

00:13.092 --> 00:15.856
And then suddenly,
we were making out.

00:16.930 --> 00:17.919
Tell it again.

00:21.501 --> 00:22.490
Seriously.

00:25.572 --> 00:29.303
Is that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

00:29.642 --> 00:33.942
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was
talking about geography.

00:34.380 --> 00:38.783
She was listing the countries
she's done it in.

00:39.752 --> 00:41.720
I think we all
learned something.

00:43.323 --> 00:45.587
Hey, you guys. Look what I found!
Look at this.

00:45.758 --> 00:48.022
That's my mom's writing.
Look.

00:48.194 --> 00:51.960
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1965."

00:52.131 --> 00:55.931
- Do you know what that means?
- That you're actually 50?

00:56.269 --> 00:59.102
That's not me, Phoebe.
That's her pal Phoebe.

00:59.272 --> 01:01.672
According to her high-school
yearbook, they were BFF.

01:03.476 --> 01:06.673
- Best Friends Forever.
- That's great!

01:06.846 --> 01:11.078
I know! She probably has all kinds
of stories about my parents.

01:11.251 --> 01:13.048
And she might even know
where my dad is.

01:13.219 --> 01:15.187
I looked her up.
She lives by the beach.

01:15.355 --> 01:17.255
Maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

01:17.423 --> 01:18.788
Yeah, we can!

01:18.958 --> 01:22.086
- Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
- That's too bad.

01:22.762 --> 01:24.423
Big fat bummer.

01:25.965 --> 01:28.433
So, great! Tomorrow we're
gonna drive out to Montauk.

01:28.601 --> 01:31.001
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

01:34.173 --> 01:35.299
The One At the Beach

02:20.853 --> 02:23.481
Joey will be right down.
He's looking for his mask.

02:23.656 --> 02:25.647
- A swim mask?
- No, his gorilla mask.

02:27.226 --> 02:30.093
He wears it in the ocean
to scare off the fish.

02:32.932 --> 02:34.456
Would you look at them?

02:35.268 --> 02:37.759
I'm never gonna find
a boyfriend again.

02:37.937 --> 02:40.303
I'm gonna die an old maid.

02:40.473 --> 02:42.771
You're not gonna die an old maid.

02:42.942 --> 02:45.536
Maybe an old spinster cook.

02:48.348 --> 02:51.317
- Thanks.
- Besides, worse comes to worse...

02:51.484 --> 02:53.679
...I'll be your boyfriend.

02:56.723 --> 02:57.747
Yeah, right.

03:00.994 --> 03:02.928
Why is that so funny?

03:03.096 --> 03:05.223
You made a joke, right?

03:05.398 --> 03:07.832
So I laughed.

03:09.402 --> 03:11.666
A little too hard.

03:12.238 --> 03:14.331
What am I,
not boyfriend material?

03:15.041 --> 03:17.100
No. You're Chandler.

03:18.711 --> 03:21.544
You know. Chandler!

03:21.848 --> 03:25.249
Okay, so we've established
my name and hit me.

03:25.885 --> 03:28.877
But theoretically, say we weren't
friends. Say it's a blind date.

03:29.055 --> 03:33.685
I show up at your door, and I'm,
like, "Hey, nice to meet you."

03:35.028 --> 03:39.158
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.095
Hey. Good!
You bought food.

03:42.268 --> 03:44.759
No, just my luggage.

03:51.844 --> 03:54.074
I am having the best karma this week.

03:54.247 --> 03:56.374
First, I find this woman
who knew my parents...

03:56.549 --> 03:59.541
...then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

03:59.719 --> 04:02.552
What about that bike
messenger you hit?

04:02.722 --> 04:05.088
I wasn't talking about his karma.

04:06.959 --> 04:09.484
Hey, check out the hat!

04:12.365 --> 04:14.663
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.826
I was taken aboard that hat.

04:18.237 --> 04:21.798
They did experiments on me.
I can't have children!

04:23.109 --> 04:25.407
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

04:25.578 --> 04:27.045
Ross gave it to me.

04:27.213 --> 04:29.977
- I think she looks good.
- Thank you.

04:30.149 --> 04:32.413
Did he buy it for you...

04:32.585 --> 04:33.779
...or win it for you?

04:35.388 --> 04:37.822
Excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

04:37.990 --> 04:40.015
...I'm here to tell you
that hats are back.

04:40.193 --> 04:43.924
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant superhat.

04:50.069 --> 04:51.127
Go, go, go!

04:51.304 --> 04:53.568
Now everybody wants to be
under the hat!

05:01.247 --> 05:03.044
What's with all this sand?

05:03.216 --> 05:05.776
Bob said there might be flood damage.

05:05.952 --> 05:08.182
Either that, or he has
a really big cat.

05:09.889 --> 05:11.982
You know what this reminds me of?

05:12.391 --> 05:14.757
Why couldn't I be your boyfriend?

05:16.162 --> 05:18.289
Are you still on that?

05:18.464 --> 05:20.989
- Would you let it go already?
- Thank you, Joey.

05:21.167 --> 05:23.328
But you'd go out with me, right?

05:23.503 --> 05:27.234
No. It's the same as with Chandler.
We're friends.

05:27.406 --> 05:30.341
Let's say that we were
the last two guys on the planet...

05:30.510 --> 05:33.570
...and you had a gun to your head.
Which one would you pick?

05:33.746 --> 05:36.476
Which one of you
has the gun to my head?

05:40.453 --> 05:42.353
Well, yes.
It's kind of an unusual house.

05:42.522 --> 05:46.390
It has three beautiful bedrooms
and no baths.

05:46.659 --> 05:49.685
But, you know,
the ocean is right there.

05:50.496 --> 05:51.554
Knock, knock, knock.

05:51.731 --> 05:54.063
Hang on a second.
Come in, come in.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.258
So think about it and call me back.

05:58.037 --> 06:00.335
- Are you Phoebe Abbott?
- Yes.

06:00.506 --> 06:03.839
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
I'm your best friend's daughter!

06:06.245 --> 06:07.610
You're Irwin's daughter?

06:07.813 --> 06:10.111
No. I mean your old best friend.

06:10.283 --> 06:11.272
Here.

06:11.450 --> 06:14.977
- Lily? From high school? Remember?
- Oh, God, Lily.

06:15.154 --> 06:17.850
Yes. Of course I remember Lily.

06:19.525 --> 06:22.050
- Then you must be...
- Phoebe, Phoebe.

06:23.829 --> 06:26.127
She named me after you, I guess.

06:26.499 --> 06:29.195
Wow. Well.
Look, there's Frank!

06:29.368 --> 06:33.498
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!
That's my dad. That's Frank!

06:33.706 --> 06:36.607
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

06:36.776 --> 06:39.301
Take it easy.
If you want, there's cookies.

06:39.478 --> 06:42.311
- Or sangria! I could make sangria!
- No, no!

06:42.548 --> 06:45.108
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

06:47.353 --> 06:50.982
Anyway, I've been
looking for my father.

06:51.924 --> 06:55.621
- Have you heard from him or seen him?
- No, I'm sorry.

06:55.795 --> 06:59.754
I guess I lost track of everybody
after high school.

07:01.734 --> 07:05.636
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

07:05.805 --> 07:09.036
Well, you know,
we were always together.

07:09.208 --> 07:12.735
- The other kids had a nickname for us.
- What was it?

07:12.912 --> 07:14.402
The Three Losers.

07:15.214 --> 07:17.307
Poor Lily.

07:18.651 --> 07:22.985
I heard about what happened. That
must have been just terrible for you...

07:23.155 --> 07:25.680
...losing your mother that way.

07:26.192 --> 07:28.626
Yeah, no, it was great.

07:39.438 --> 07:41.599
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

07:41.774 --> 07:44.641
- What?
- I mean, naked game.

07:45.211 --> 07:47.873
- We should totally play strip poker.
- No!

07:48.047 --> 07:49.412
Are you crazy?

07:49.582 --> 07:53.143
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

07:53.719 --> 07:55.118
Well, it's not a law.

07:55.288 --> 07:58.883
As long as it stays attached to that
tax reform bill, it never will be!

08:00.226 --> 08:01.955
- All done.
- Thank you.

08:02.128 --> 08:04.653
Okay. Who's next?

08:06.132 --> 08:07.121
No!

08:08.634 --> 08:09.965
No way!

08:10.136 --> 08:14.334
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

08:18.644 --> 08:21.943
Well, if that's the rule
this weekend...

08:23.783 --> 08:26.877
- Get away.
- Take it like a man. Come on!

08:28.788 --> 08:29.812
Big bullies!

08:43.903 --> 08:46.997
- How are we doing?
- Bored and bored.

08:48.541 --> 08:51.009
You know what naked card game's
never boring?

08:51.177 --> 08:52.166
No!

08:53.979 --> 08:55.742
So, what's Phoebe like?

08:55.948 --> 08:59.714
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?

09:00.786 --> 09:03.346
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

09:03.556 --> 09:06.184
I think she knows where my dad is!

09:06.359 --> 09:08.418
- Cool!
- Well, where is he?

09:08.594 --> 09:11.529
She was pretending she hasn't
heard from him in years...

09:11.697 --> 09:13.665
...but I found this picture
on her fridge.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.563
Isn't this what he would
look like now?

09:17.269 --> 09:21.330
- Totally familiar.
- Oh, yeah!

09:21.874 --> 09:23.136
Why would she lie to you?

09:23.309 --> 09:26.710
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
so I figured she'll tell me then.

09:26.879 --> 09:29.143
Maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

09:29.315 --> 09:31.613
...to buy me presents.
I don't know.

09:32.752 --> 09:35.312
- So you're all bored?
- Yes.

09:35.488 --> 09:38.889
I'll close my eyes
and point to someone.

09:39.058 --> 09:42.687
Whoever I point to has to come up with
something fun, and we have to do it.

09:42.862 --> 09:45.194
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

09:48.567 --> 09:50.660
You know, we could just do this!

09:55.141 --> 09:58.372
We all have to play strip poker?

09:59.912 --> 10:02.710
Why, all of a sudden,
do you wanna play strip poker?

10:02.882 --> 10:06.579
I think because of margaritas
three, four and nine.

10:09.255 --> 10:11.485
Strip Happy Days Game?

10:11.657 --> 10:16.959
I couldn't find cards, so it was this
or Strip Bag-of-old-knitting-stuff.

10:17.663 --> 10:19.221
Done.

10:20.766 --> 10:25.965
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points."

10:27.039 --> 10:30.702
If you get five points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

10:30.876 --> 10:33.470
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

10:34.647 --> 10:35.875
Okay, come on.

10:36.348 --> 10:38.908
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

10:39.084 --> 10:42.281
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

10:46.859 --> 10:51.319
Okay. "Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to Inspiration Point.

10:51.497 --> 10:53.795
Collect three cool points."
Yeah!

10:53.966 --> 10:55.797
Which gives me five.

10:55.968 --> 10:59.062
And let's see, who is gonna
lose their clothes?

10:59.238 --> 11:03.231
I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

11:06.912 --> 11:09.210
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

11:11.951 --> 11:16.320
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points."

11:16.489 --> 11:21.927
Which means I have five,
and that means I get Joey's boxers.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.429
Fine. Gang up on me.

11:29.602 --> 11:32.537
I got you all
right where I want you.

11:32.905 --> 11:34.702
Come on! Take them off!

11:34.874 --> 11:36.535
Actually, it's kind of cold.

11:36.709 --> 11:40.167
How about I keep my boxers on
and give you a peek at the good stuff?

11:40.579 --> 11:42.809
All right,
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

11:42.982 --> 11:45.974
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

11:46.151 --> 11:48.745
I'm just making margaritas.

11:49.788 --> 11:51.915
Think I'll help her out.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.720
- What is going on here?
- What?

11:57.897 --> 12:00.422
- You're painting his toenails.
- Come on!

12:00.599 --> 12:02.464
- Chasing him around the room.
- Please!

12:02.635 --> 12:05.001
He's totally flirting with you too.

12:05.938 --> 12:07.997
He is, isn't he?

12:09.041 --> 12:12.636
I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

12:12.811 --> 12:14.904
...I don't know,
but it's like something...

12:20.786 --> 12:22.378
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Hi.

12:22.555 --> 12:25.456
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

12:25.624 --> 12:27.023
What are you guys doing?

12:27.192 --> 12:29.752
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

12:30.763 --> 12:32.788
Cool! I'll catch up!

12:40.105 --> 12:42.471
So you still don't think...

12:42.641 --> 12:45.075
...I'm boyfriend material?

12:46.579 --> 12:49.878
I saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

12:50.149 --> 12:51.912
You didn't even
take off your pants.

12:52.084 --> 12:54.450
Well, lucky for you.

12:55.187 --> 12:56.848
- What?
- I don't know.

12:58.490 --> 13:02.756
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

13:03.929 --> 13:05.191
Joey's asleep.

13:15.107 --> 13:18.372
After he passed out, we put the
sand around him to keep him warm.

13:21.380 --> 13:25.043
Well, I assume the happy couple
isn't up yet?

13:25.217 --> 13:27.481
Did you guys hear them last night?

13:27.653 --> 13:29.518
I don't know what
they were doing, but...

13:29.688 --> 13:32.054
...sea turtles actually
came up to the house.

13:34.526 --> 13:36.460
Good morning.

13:36.629 --> 13:38.256
- How'd everybody sleep?
- Great.

13:38.430 --> 13:40.523
- Like a log.
- Us too.

13:42.835 --> 13:43.824
I'm going for a walk.

13:49.475 --> 13:52.410
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.

14:03.122 --> 14:04.885
Hey, what happened to you?

14:05.057 --> 14:08.515
Nothing. I just felt like
hanging out and reading.

14:09.161 --> 14:13.359
The water was so great. We jumped
off this pier and my suit came off.

14:14.933 --> 14:16.366
Sorry I missed that.

14:16.802 --> 14:18.736
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.565
I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

14:23.742 --> 14:25.767
It was so much easier
when I shaved my head.

14:30.683 --> 14:32.981
You know, I gotta tell you...

14:33.152 --> 14:35.985
...I just loved your look
when you were bald.

14:36.722 --> 14:38.553
Really?

14:38.724 --> 14:41.420
I think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

14:41.927 --> 14:43.588
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:44.129 --> 14:45.926
You definitely should do that.

14:47.032 --> 14:49.227
- You know what? I should do it!
- Yeah!

14:49.401 --> 14:52.234
You know what? Thank you.
You are so cool.

14:52.404 --> 14:54.531
Stop. Go on.

14:54.707 --> 14:57.437
- Now go shave that head.
- All right.

15:04.717 --> 15:08.346
- I know I've asked you this before.
- A hundred times before!

15:11.223 --> 15:14.158
- How am I not right for you?
- I don't know.

15:14.326 --> 15:16.294
I like guys like Richard.

15:16.462 --> 15:19.260
Or Pete,
before he went insane.

15:19.431 --> 15:22.491
I don't know.
Just somebody more mature.

15:22.668 --> 15:25.228
So I'm not mature enough for you?

15:25.404 --> 15:27.531
Monica needs somebody more mature.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.447
What's the matter?

15:36.615 --> 15:39.516
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

15:39.685 --> 15:43.143
She claims she had to go out of town
suddenly. She's avoiding me.

15:43.322 --> 15:46.883
She doesn't want to tell me where my
father is. She knows but won't tell me!

15:47.059 --> 15:49.254
Pheebs, that sucks.

15:50.362 --> 15:53.263
Well, don't
"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

15:54.299 --> 15:56.893
- Where are you going?
- She's out of town.

15:57.069 --> 16:00.698
There's gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my father is.

16:00.873 --> 16:03.307
Some people call that
"breaking and entering."

16:03.742 --> 16:06.609
- Well, are any of those people here?
- No.

16:06.779 --> 16:11.011
Okay. Look,
I'll do something nice, okay?

16:11.183 --> 16:13.344
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

16:15.487 --> 16:17.318
Hey, everybody!

16:21.927 --> 16:23.360
Look what you did!

16:25.164 --> 16:28.691
- You wanna touch it?
- No, but it's great.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.459
Come on, touch it.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.207
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

16:50.189 --> 16:53.249
I was having a little chat
with Bonnie, and guess what?

16:53.425 --> 16:57.953
She happened to bring up who was
behind the whole head-shaving idea.

16:58.130 --> 17:00.963
And now, who was it?
That's right. It was you!

17:02.734 --> 17:05.100
That was her idea.

17:05.270 --> 17:07.795
I just gave her a nudge.

17:07.973 --> 17:10.533
She said you gave her the razor.

17:13.045 --> 17:15.775
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

17:15.948 --> 17:17.575
- No, I'm good.
- No, thanks.

17:17.749 --> 17:20.309
- Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay, have fun.

17:22.187 --> 17:25.884
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

17:26.058 --> 17:29.357
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head!

17:30.796 --> 17:33.424
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I don't know.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.692
You don't know?
You balded my girlfriend!

17:35.868 --> 17:36.994
All right.

17:38.904 --> 17:42.362
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

17:42.541 --> 17:44.600
You're the one who ended it!
Remember?

17:44.776 --> 17:48.803
Because I was mad at you!
Not because I stopped loving you!

17:50.148 --> 17:52.810
- You still love me?
- No.

17:54.753 --> 17:55.777
You still love me.

17:56.822 --> 17:59.256
Yeah, so?
You love me.

18:04.529 --> 18:06.087
What does this mean?

18:06.265 --> 18:08.995
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

18:09.167 --> 18:11.692
No! Maybe!

18:11.904 --> 18:13.462
I don't know.

18:19.244 --> 18:23.010
I still can't forgive you
for what you did.

18:23.181 --> 18:26.150
I can't. But sometimes when
I'm with you, I just feel so...

18:26.618 --> 18:27.676
What?

18:28.654 --> 18:31.054
I just feel...

18:32.190 --> 18:34.556
- I just...
- What?

18:34.993 --> 18:35.982
I feel...

18:44.503 --> 18:46.266
No! I don't care!

18:46.438 --> 18:50.772
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice!

18:50.943 --> 18:53.104
But I made cards!

18:56.048 --> 18:57.640
Good night.

18:58.150 --> 19:00.084
I'm going upstairs.

19:00.252 --> 19:02.049
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:08.927 --> 19:10.724
Wanna play strip poker
for practice?

19:29.047 --> 19:30.480
My ass!

20:09.054 --> 20:11.022
No! It's me! It's me!

20:11.189 --> 20:14.215
- I didn't wanna make any noise!
- Then don't break in!

20:16.028 --> 20:18.588
- I'm sorry!
- What are you doing here?

20:19.131 --> 20:22.794
I came to fill your ice-cube tray.

20:24.036 --> 20:25.060
What?

20:28.407 --> 20:30.671
Okay, look.

20:31.476 --> 20:35.606
I took this picture from your fridge.
I know that this is my father.

20:35.781 --> 20:39.148
This is Frank Buffay, and you were
standing next to him!

20:39.618 --> 20:42.143
Now, look, I deserve
to know where I came from.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.585
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

20:45.757 --> 20:47.952
Otherwise, you're just mean.

20:50.328 --> 20:52.558
So just tell me the truth.

20:52.831 --> 20:54.492
All right.

20:54.833 --> 20:58.997
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

21:01.039 --> 21:03.337
My father is Chuck Mangione?

21:03.508 --> 21:05.942
No, no!
That's just Chuck Mangione.

21:06.111 --> 21:08.511
I sold him a house last year.

21:08.680 --> 21:12.776
And I'm very sorry, but I really
don't know where your father is.

21:12.951 --> 21:14.782
And that's the truth.

21:16.888 --> 21:19.322
But you're right.

21:19.758 --> 21:22.886
I think that a person should know
where they come from.

21:23.595 --> 21:26.120
Which is why I...

21:34.439 --> 21:36.805
I'm your mother.

21:41.413 --> 21:44.746
I wanted to tell you
yesterday, but I just...

21:44.916 --> 21:46.577
...felt all floopy, and...

21:49.754 --> 21:51.984
You guys are totally
getting back together.

21:52.157 --> 21:54.625
That's not true. She doesn't
even know what she wants.

21:54.793 --> 21:56.761
Rachel's still mad
about the whole thing.

21:56.928 --> 22:00.227
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

22:00.398 --> 22:02.332
Take it from a guy who's...

22:02.501 --> 22:05.834
...never had a long-term relationship.

22:06.605 --> 22:11.133
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

22:13.478 --> 22:15.912
The water is great.
You should go in.

22:16.081 --> 22:18.379
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

22:18.550 --> 22:20.814
Okay.
Well, good night.

22:20.986 --> 22:22.453
Good night.

22:23.355 --> 22:26.449
- Don't be too long.
- Okey-dokey.

22:27.592 --> 22:30.060
There is not one hair
on that head.

22:30.228 --> 22:34.858
It'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

22:35.033 --> 22:36.967
And I'm finally moving on.

22:37.135 --> 22:39.797
Getting over Rachel was so...

22:40.972 --> 22:43.941
I'm finally feeling sane.
And if I go up there...

22:44.109 --> 22:46.100
...and I kiss her...

22:46.278 --> 22:48.872
God, I want to kiss her!

22:49.047 --> 22:52.915
And it doesn't work out, do I wanna
put myself through that again?

22:53.084 --> 22:54.483
Let me get this straight.

22:54.653 --> 22:59.647
If you go with Bonnie, you're doing the
smart, healthy thing and moving on.

22:59.824 --> 23:03.260
Right? And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

23:27.085 --> 23:28.074
Hi there.

23:29.955 --> 23:32.287
That's that weird voice again.

23:32.457 --> 23:33.788
Okay.
Let me try it again.

23:33.959 --> 23:37.395
You're gonna wanna date this next guy,
I swear! Okay, come on.

23:43.335 --> 23:45.803
I can only do it
with the voice now.

23:45.971 --> 23:48.303
Okay, okay.
Close the door!

23:52.978 --> 23:54.468
Hi, I'm Dorf!

23:56.581 --> 23:58.674
Your date for the evening.

24:00.719 --> 24:02.584
Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff!

24:04.189 --> 24:05.178
