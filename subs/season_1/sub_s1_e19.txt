WEBVTT

00:02.902 --> 00:04.028
Okay, I checked.

00:04.237 --> 00:07.900
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,
Cinnamon Stick...

00:08.208 --> 00:11.871
...Chamomile, Mint Medley,
Blackberry and

00:12.145 --> 00:14.807
Wait, there's one more.
Lemon Soother!

00:16.716 --> 00:20.015
You're not the guy that asked
for tea, are you?

00:22.155 --> 00:24.248
The One Where The Monkey Gets Away

01:12.072 --> 01:14.632
Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.468
Thank you.

01:17.677 --> 01:20.942
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

01:21.147 --> 01:25.049
Oh, good. Because where else
would we get any?

01:25.819 --> 01:27.582
Oh, right.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.589
-Oh, great.
-What is it?

01:31.791 --> 01:33.622
Country club newsletter.

01:33.860 --> 01:38.661
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.365
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

01:43.636 --> 01:45.467
Barry, who you almost

01:45.672 --> 01:47.264
And Mindy, your maid of

01:47.507 --> 01:50.032
Let me see. That's Mindy?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.470
She is pretty!

01:53.880 --> 01:55.040
Lucky...

01:56.616 --> 02:00.211
...to have had a friend like you.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.545
Now it's quiet time.

02:09.162 --> 02:12.029
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.994
Good boy. Give me the rice.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.928
Thank you. Good boy.

02:16.269 --> 02:21.468
He's mastered the difference between
"bring me the" and "pee in the."

02:23.977 --> 02:26.810
"Bring me the" and
Rach?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.540
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.179
This is so stupid!

02:33.453 --> 02:35.580
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

02:35.788 --> 02:37.847
I should be happy for them.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.752
I am. I'm happy for them.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.793
-Really?
-No.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.990
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.565
Whoa, what....

02:49.836 --> 02:54.034
What happened to "Forget
relationships! I'm done with men!"

02:54.240 --> 02:57.073
The whole penis embargo?

03:01.548 --> 03:02.640
I don't know.

03:02.882 --> 03:07.080
It's not about no guys.
It's about the right guy.

03:07.353 --> 03:11.517
With Barry it was safe and easy,
but there was no heat.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.125
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

03:15.328 --> 03:19.992
-lt was this raw, animal, sexual
-Right. I got it.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.061
I was there.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.197
Do you think you can have both?

03:25.405 --> 03:30.172
Someone who's your best friend
but also can make your toes curl.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.469
Yes.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.204
Yes, I do. I really do.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.750
In fact, it's funny.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.920
Often, someone
you wouldn't think could...

03:41.554 --> 03:43.385
...curl your toes...

03:43.590 --> 03:45.956
... might just be the one who...

03:47.427 --> 03:48.792
...gets interrupted.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.654
How was the movie?

03:50.863 --> 03:52.558
-Wonderful!
-So good!

03:52.765 --> 03:55.700
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

03:57.804 --> 04:02.434
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with guns and bombs...

04:02.642 --> 04:04.872
...and buses going really fast!

04:07.213 --> 04:09.807
I don't need violence
in a movie...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.745
...as long as
there's a little nudity.

04:13.052 --> 04:16.510
-There was nudity.
-I meant female nudity.

04:16.723 --> 04:20.090
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.227
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

04:24.297 --> 04:26.288
All right, I've got to go.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.932
Come on, Marcel.

04:28.134 --> 04:31.934
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

04:32.405 --> 04:35.431
They're still just friends, right?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.805
And I will see you tomorrow.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.072
You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.117
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.187
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

04:50.423 --> 04:53.688
Unclench. You're not even
gonna be here.

04:59.198 --> 05:05.103
-I can't believe we're discussing this.
-I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

05:05.672 --> 05:09.130
If it was gonna happen,
wouldn't it have happened already?

05:09.509 --> 05:13.969
She said she wants a relationship
with someone exactly like me.

05:14.213 --> 05:15.475
She said that?

05:15.715 --> 05:19.014
I added the exactly like me" part.

05:19.385 --> 05:23.879
But she's looking for someone.
And someone will be there tonight.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.388
"Tonight" tonight?

05:25.692 --> 05:28.456
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

05:28.661 --> 05:32.290
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

05:34.233 --> 05:38.363
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.335
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd pick up some wine...

05:46.546 --> 05:50.243
...go over there and try to woo her.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.342
Know what you should do?

05:53.553 --> 05:57.853
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

06:01.627 --> 06:05.757
If you keep this up, you'll be
finished by the weekend.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.259
The one in the feathered boa
is Dr. Francis.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.834
Now, she used to be a man.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.903
Look, there's Raven.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.508
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.176
And then
What? Marcel!

06:20.613 --> 06:24.549
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to

06:26.853 --> 06:30.289
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

06:30.490 --> 06:33.254
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

06:33.726 --> 06:36.422
Oh, God!

06:40.633 --> 06:42.533
Sorry, Barry.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.128
A little engagement gift.

06:45.371 --> 06:48.306
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

06:55.948 --> 06:58.212
Who died? Who died?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.148
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

07:02.188 --> 07:06.454
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because

07:06.659 --> 07:07.648
Marcel?

07:11.731 --> 07:14.131
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

07:14.300 --> 07:17.736
We were watching TV,
he pooped in Monica's shoe....

07:17.937 --> 07:20.872
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

07:21.073 --> 07:23.974
I don't know. The left one!

07:24.177 --> 07:25.235
Which ones?

07:25.445 --> 07:29.779
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

07:33.486 --> 07:36.649
Why is the air in here so negative?

07:37.590 --> 07:39.319
Rachel lost Marcel.

07:39.592 --> 07:40.581
Oh, no! How?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.819
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.326
The cute black ones I always wear.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.690
No, which one?

07:47.900 --> 07:50.334
The right or left?

07:50.736 --> 07:52.897
Because the left one is lucky.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.902
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

07:55.074 --> 07:58.669
All right. You're a monkey.
You're loose in the city.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.879
Where do you go?

08:01.247 --> 08:05.081
It's his first time out,
so he'll do touristy things.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.954
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.187
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

08:15.428 --> 08:17.919
He'll be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me!

08:18.130 --> 08:22.362
Search the building. Take the first
floor. We'll take the rest.

08:22.602 --> 08:23.967
What am I gonna do?

08:24.203 --> 08:26.671
You stay here
and wait by the phone.

08:26.873 --> 08:30.468
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.042
Does anybody want to trade?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.786
What do you want?

08:41.988 --> 08:45.355
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?

08:45.558 --> 08:48.959
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

08:49.562 --> 08:53.498
-Why'd you leave it in the hall?
-I wasn't ready for it.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.991
Have you seen a monkey?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.000
I saw Regis Philbin once.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.871
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.704
You owe me a waffle.

09:06.479 --> 09:10.006
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...

09:10.249 --> 09:15.277
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.647
Thanks.

09:18.424 --> 09:19.823
How did it go today?

09:20.026 --> 09:22.927
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.493
Is that wine?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.755
You want some?

09:26.966 --> 09:28.695
Oh, I would love some.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.267
But let's not drink it here.

09:31.504 --> 09:35.201
I'm feeling crazy.
You wanna go to Newark?

09:39.145 --> 09:44.515
Okay, but before we head off to
the murder capital of the Northeast...

09:44.884 --> 09:48.012
... I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.847
You know how we
were talking before...

09:51.057 --> 09:53.890
...about relationships, and stuff.

09:54.093 --> 09:58.496
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.199
Oh, God!

10:08.574 --> 10:11.600
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.836
Please don't hate me.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.035
What?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.781
You know Marcel?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.781
I kind of lost him.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.337
I can't believe this.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.738
All I asked you to do was
keep him in here!

10:47.947 --> 10:49.107
I know. I'm sorry.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.215
It's partially my fault.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.182
I shouldn't have had you
start with a monkey.

10:54.353 --> 10:57.345
You should have started
with a pencil.

10:57.657 --> 11:02.458
I'm doing everything I can.
Everyone's looking for him and I got

11:04.830 --> 11:06.593
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

11:06.866 --> 11:11.860
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

11:13.739 --> 11:16.537
Why? Do you not like them?

11:19.011 --> 11:23.209
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

11:26.318 --> 11:31.415
I'm not allowed to have him. If they
find him, they'll take him away.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.923
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

11:35.728 --> 11:39.858
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

11:45.171 --> 11:46.570
Thanks for coming.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.933
Somebody called about a monkey?

11:49.141 --> 11:52.633
You know, that was
a complete misunderstanding.

11:52.845 --> 11:55.473
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.582
-Turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

11:59.819 --> 12:02.481
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.

12:02.688 --> 12:07.022
-My uncle Marcel.
-ls that who the monkey's named after?

12:07.927 --> 12:10.953
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable...

12:11.130 --> 12:14.657
... by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

12:14.834 --> 12:15.823
Oh, my God!

12:16.635 --> 12:19.968
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

12:24.577 --> 12:29.776
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

12:29.982 --> 12:33.509
Yes, but there isn't always time.

12:35.888 --> 12:40.655
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.328
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.222
Oh, my God, you are!

12:46.499 --> 12:48.126
And you're Rachel Greene!

12:49.835 --> 12:52.463
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?

12:52.705 --> 12:56.038
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.973
Luisa! Oh, my God!

13:00.179 --> 13:02.238
Monica! It's Luisa!

13:04.884 --> 13:06.317
I went there too!

13:06.519 --> 13:08.510
Luisa! From homeroom!

13:10.623 --> 13:13.387
You have no idea who I am, do you?

13:13.592 --> 13:15.184
-No.
-Not at all.

13:15.494 --> 13:20.124
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

13:20.332 --> 13:24.098
Would it have been hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...

13:24.303 --> 13:26.669
...or "Nice overalls"?

13:31.210 --> 13:32.802
Oh, I'm so sorry!

13:33.012 --> 13:37.346
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.513
But you. What a bitch!

13:43.389 --> 13:44.651
What?

13:44.857 --> 13:47.291
You know what? Be that as it may...

13:47.493 --> 13:51.589
...could you help us with the
monkey thing, for old times'sake?

13:51.797 --> 13:53.765
Go, Bobcats!

13:54.366 --> 13:57.301
I could. But I won't.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.768
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.845
Sorry.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.241
Marcel?

14:12.918 --> 14:13.976
Marcel?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.359
Hi, can I help you?

14:28.534 --> 14:32.698
We're having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.568
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

14:36.775 --> 14:39.209
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.379
Can you fix radiators?

14:41.580 --> 14:44.981
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

14:45.284 --> 14:48.185
-Of course!
-Oh. Then, no.

14:52.391 --> 14:56.327
-Taste this. Is there too much rum?
-Just a second.

14:56.528 --> 14:59.088
-Hope you find your monkey.
-No, wait!

15:00.566 --> 15:03.034
We may not know about radiators...

15:03.302 --> 15:08.239
... but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.177
Aren't we in the middle of something?

15:14.346 --> 15:18.214
But these women are very hot,
and they need our help.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.215
And they're very hot!

15:23.455 --> 15:24.922
We can't, all right?

15:25.224 --> 15:26.589
We're sorry.

15:26.825 --> 15:30.727
You don't know how sorry.
We promised to find this monkey.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.058
He's this high
and answers to the name Marcel.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.600
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

15:46.645 --> 15:50.376
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

15:58.824 --> 15:59.950
-Oh, my God!
-What?

16:00.159 --> 16:03.151
Something brushed up
against my right leg.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.189
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

16:08.767 --> 16:09.756
Look, Phoebe!

16:10.502 --> 16:12.561
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

16:12.805 --> 16:14.329
Step aside, ladies.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.102
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a tranquilizer.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.858
Run, Marcel, run!

16:37.196 --> 16:38.185
Damn!

16:38.464 --> 16:41.763
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.198
Oh, gosh!

17:02.721 --> 17:06.555
We've been all over the neighborhood!
He's just gone!

17:06.759 --> 17:09.887
-You don't know that.
-It's cold, it's dark.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.359
He doesn't know the Village!

17:12.564 --> 17:17.501
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!

17:17.736 --> 17:18.998
Thank you very much!

17:19.204 --> 17:22.002
I've said I'm sorry a million times.

17:22.307 --> 17:23.934
What do you want me to do?

17:24.276 --> 17:28.110
You want me to break my foot too?
I'll break it right now.

17:28.313 --> 17:31.771
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

17:31.984 --> 17:35.750
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...

17:35.954 --> 17:39.446
... I don't miss Marcel anymore!

17:40.759 --> 17:43.455
It's not like
I did this on purpose.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.755
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

17:46.031 --> 17:48.795
Things just sort of happen around you!

17:49.001 --> 17:52.698
You're off in "Rachel Land,"
doing your "Rachel Thing"...

17:52.905 --> 17:57.239
...oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and

17:57.509 --> 18:00.603
I don't want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.673
What?

18:06.285 --> 18:08.879
Hey, banana man!

18:14.793 --> 18:16.192
This is so intense!

18:16.395 --> 18:21.423
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.938
-What's with Phoebe?
-Tranquilizer dart.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.806
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

18:31.977 --> 18:34.468
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

18:34.713 --> 18:38.046
-I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with the bananas?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.275
Potassium.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.954
Okay, where is he?

18:47.593 --> 18:49.857
You're wasting your time.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.758
What?

19:02.774 --> 19:06.733
-What have you done to him?
-That's my monkey. That's Patty.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.476
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.711
Come here, Patty.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.409
Come here, Marcel.

19:15.921 --> 19:16.979
Come here, Patty.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.987
Here, monkey.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.516
Here, monkey!

19:20.726 --> 19:22.489
Gotcha!

19:23.061 --> 19:25.723
-Give me my monkey back!
-It's mine.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.922
Take this up with the judge.

19:28.133 --> 19:32.695
That's not my monkey. The dress
is mine. Send it back whenever.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.805
All right, I want my monkey!

19:35.007 --> 19:37.999
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.441
You had to be a bitch in school,
instead of fat.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.115
In high school, I was prom queen...

19:46.385 --> 19:49.980
...and the homecoming queen and you...

19:50.189 --> 19:52.054
...were also there.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.918
But this isn't high school.
We're all adults here!

19:57.229 --> 19:59.993
Heckles! Can I have this?

20:00.732 --> 20:02.324
For the most part.

20:02.534 --> 20:07.062
If you take this monkey, I'll lose
an important person in my life.

20:07.272 --> 20:11.402
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.807
You have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.844
Take it!

20:19.985 --> 20:21.009
No.

20:21.720 --> 20:26.248
All right. Then I'll call
your supervisor and tell her...

20:26.425 --> 20:29.292
...you shot my friend with a dart!

20:36.602 --> 20:39.332
It'll be nice to get this off,
won't it?

20:39.538 --> 20:42.507
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

20:42.708 --> 20:47.042
With the right pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

20:50.616 --> 20:54.916
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard
on you before

20:55.120 --> 20:58.248
No, it was my fault.
I almost lost your

20:58.457 --> 21:02.154
Yeah, but you got him back.
You were great.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.193
We still have that bottle of wine.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.303
Are you in the mood
for something grape?

21:14.539 --> 21:17.770
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

21:27.886 --> 21:31.049
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

21:37.329 --> 21:40.821
Well, as long as we're here...

21:42.467 --> 21:44.332
...and not on the subject....

21:45.671 --> 21:47.935
I was thinking about...

21:50.275 --> 21:53.301
... how mad we got
at each other before.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.449
And maybe it was partially
because of how we

22:01.086 --> 22:02.917
-Rachel?
-Barry?

22:03.221 --> 22:07.715
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

22:07.926 --> 22:10.451
I think I'm still in love with you.

22:15.534 --> 22:19.402
We have got to start
locking that door!

22:27.446 --> 22:28.743
Show us! Come on!

22:28.947 --> 22:32.883
-lt was such a long time ago.
-Okay, fine. All right.

22:33.085 --> 22:37.249
This is me in The Sound of Music.
See the von Trapp kids?

22:37.589 --> 22:40.353
That's because I'm in front of them.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.388
Big nun!

22:43.195 --> 22:45.425
I thought that was an alp.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.827
High school wasn't
my favorite time.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.194
I loved high school.

22:50.402 --> 22:54.202
It was four years of parties,
dating and sex and

22:54.406 --> 22:57.807
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

22:58.076 --> 23:02.376
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.481
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

23:11.656 --> 23:14.682
My butt cheek is waking up!
