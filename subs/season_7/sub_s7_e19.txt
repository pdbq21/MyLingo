WEBVTT

00:04.453 --> 00:07.229
Oh, hey! How was your audition?

00:07.932 --> 00:09.984
I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:11.481 --> 00:12.797
What are you doing?

00:13.012 --> 00:16.653
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

00:16.838 --> 00:17.775
You got it?

00:17.986 --> 00:21.592
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

00:21.814 --> 00:25.455
A big-budget period movie
about three Italian brothers...

00:25.711 --> 00:29.495
...who come to America at the
turn of the century. It's classy.

00:29.712 --> 00:33.816
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

00:35.730 --> 00:36.904
The "next-next"?

00:37.088 --> 00:40.943
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

00:41.193 --> 00:43.138
This guy's right after him.

00:46.550 --> 00:47.522
Hello?

00:47.768 --> 00:53.498
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

00:53.752 --> 00:54.761
They loved me!

00:56.118 --> 00:58.550
They want to see you again tomorrow.

00:58.763 --> 01:00.779
- My God!
- There's just one thing.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.807
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

01:06.660 --> 01:10.373
Are you kidding me? I never
rent a movie without it!

01:11.427 --> 01:12.364
Oh.

01:14.489 --> 01:16.991
Okay, let me call you back.

01:17.306 --> 01:20.889
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

01:21.134 --> 01:22.308
- Wow!
- I know.

01:22.595 --> 01:27.672
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

01:29.484 --> 01:33.647
The One With Ross
and Monica's Cousin

02:08.103 --> 02:10.700
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

02:10.921 --> 02:13.803
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

02:13.983 --> 02:16.972
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

02:17.184 --> 02:19.853
A "no sex" pact, huh?

02:20.523 --> 02:24.237
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.489
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

02:29.709 --> 02:32.247
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

02:32.456 --> 02:35.790
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

02:35.971 --> 02:38.961
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

02:39.207 --> 02:41.638
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

02:41.816 --> 02:43.345
You're probably right.

02:46.826 --> 02:49.743
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

02:50.410 --> 02:51.868
Subtle, guys.

02:53.227 --> 02:54.330
What?

02:54.619 --> 02:58.509
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

02:59.177 --> 03:03.589
Okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

03:03.804 --> 03:05.713
Okay. Sorry.

03:07.248 --> 03:09.395
We have to throw her a shower?

03:15.077 --> 03:17.544
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

03:17.790 --> 03:19.735
I don't know. I mean...

03:20.365 --> 03:24.433
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

03:24.679 --> 03:27.040
Nudity's really important
to the story.

03:27.219 --> 03:29.402
That's what you say about porn.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.607
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

03:32.821 --> 03:36.925
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.601
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

03:40.196 --> 03:45.439
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.753
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

03:48.998 --> 03:51.572
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

03:51.781 --> 03:56.052
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.453
It's really sweet and tender.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.853
Plus, everyone will see your thing!

04:04.759 --> 04:06.835
When can we have this shower?

04:07.055 --> 04:10.281
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.418
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

04:13.631 --> 04:16.656
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.199
If we make it yesterday, we're done!

04:20.415 --> 04:22.847
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.667
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

04:25.878 --> 04:27.052
There's too much to do.

04:27.269 --> 04:30.294
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

04:30.992 --> 04:34.088
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

04:34.298 --> 04:35.851
Just calm down, woman!

04:38.611 --> 04:40.521
Phoebe, I already did.

04:40.733 --> 04:43.129
All right, then I need to calm down.

04:44.630 --> 04:47.512
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

04:47.692 --> 04:52.034
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.267
Where will we have it?

04:54.512 --> 04:56.564
- Here. What time?
- 4:00. Food?

04:56.808 --> 04:59.963
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Great! Very Monica.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.578
- And chili!
- You went one too far.

05:04.010 --> 05:06.086
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.392
- We're paying for this.
- Neither.

05:09.611 --> 05:13.988
- What should we do for a theme?
- Lusts of the Flesh!

05:15.665 --> 05:18.856
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

05:24.224 --> 05:27.829
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

05:28.225 --> 05:30.098
Oh, boy. Me too.

05:30.833 --> 05:36.184
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
and broke up for a few hours.

05:36.366 --> 05:39.391
Technically, we could have sex again.

05:40.888 --> 05:43.355
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

05:43.568 --> 05:46.273
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

05:46.490 --> 05:47.806
That's me. Come on.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.389
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

05:51.604 --> 05:53.751
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

05:54.805 --> 05:57.272
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

05:59.607 --> 06:02.798
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

06:03.468 --> 06:06.493
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

06:06.704 --> 06:08.648
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

06:27.162 --> 06:29.902
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

06:32.346 --> 06:34.919
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

06:35.163 --> 06:39.054
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

06:39.338 --> 06:41.414
Chandler, she's our cousin!

06:41.670 --> 06:44.624
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.

06:44.835 --> 06:48.275
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

06:48.663 --> 06:49.908
Say something.

06:50.298 --> 06:53.288
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

06:54.508 --> 06:56.904
Fine. She can stay at my place.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.264
What does Cassie look like now?

06:59.483 --> 07:01.143
Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.

07:02.649 --> 07:05.152
This Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

07:05.398 --> 07:07.307
Wafer-thin ice.

07:12.948 --> 07:13.956
Hey, I'm back.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.969
Hi, Joey.

07:16.635 --> 07:18.580
Will I read the same scene again?

07:18.792 --> 07:21.888
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

07:22.098 --> 07:23.722
Oh, great.

07:24.742 --> 07:27.138
I'd have been perfect for this part.

07:27.351 --> 07:30.755
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

07:31.074 --> 07:35.867
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

07:38.381 --> 07:40.397
And, scene.

07:43.285 --> 07:47.105
Wasn't that fun? We did
a little improv there. Yeah!

07:48.400 --> 07:49.989
So, you were saying?

07:50.209 --> 07:52.878
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

07:53.236 --> 07:55.145
Wow! Sure! That's great.

07:55.393 --> 07:57.647
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

07:57.864 --> 08:00.924
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

08:01.134 --> 08:03.530
And that barn is not too cold.

08:06.422 --> 08:09.340
Perfect. There's one more thing.

08:10.458 --> 08:15.322
It's important to the director that
everything in the movie's authentic.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.791
In your love scene with Sarah...

08:18.008 --> 08:22.385
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

08:22.601 --> 08:23.775
So...

08:26.428 --> 08:28.159
So... what?

08:28.375 --> 08:33.203
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

08:33.421 --> 08:37.205
...be authentically, anatomically...

08:37.386 --> 08:40.056
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

08:40.275 --> 08:41.769
Yes!

08:42.362 --> 08:43.643
No. What?

08:46.363 --> 08:50.634
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be...

08:50.921 --> 08:52.130
Bar mitzvah-ed?

08:55.304 --> 08:58.780
Think 13 years earlier, lose the rabbi,
add a scalpel.

09:07.934 --> 09:10.638
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

09:10.856 --> 09:11.793
But you are?

09:12.004 --> 09:14.507
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.

09:15.518 --> 09:16.621
Wow!

09:17.571 --> 09:21.426
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

09:25.122 --> 09:28.668
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

09:28.878 --> 09:32.983
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

09:33.158 --> 09:35.827
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.158
You figure out how to do it later.

09:38.725 --> 09:44.525
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning...

09:44.779 --> 09:46.760
...to grow a turtleneck.

09:52.328 --> 09:58.164
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

09:58.382 --> 10:01.715
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

10:01.966 --> 10:04.563
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

10:05.201 --> 10:08.712
I have to call my agent
and tell her I can't do the part.

10:10.350 --> 10:11.703
Unless...

10:13.517 --> 10:14.489
Unless what?

10:14.699 --> 10:18.970
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

10:19.187 --> 10:20.326
...fashion.

10:24.476 --> 10:27.501
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

10:27.815 --> 10:30.212
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

10:30.425 --> 10:34.803
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

10:41.524 --> 10:45.343
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

10:45.559 --> 10:49.379
We get mahogany boxes
and carve everyone's names in them.

10:49.596 --> 10:53.309
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.

10:55.162 --> 10:57.344
Okay. Okay.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.111
You take care of that.

11:02.399 --> 11:06.918
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

11:07.131 --> 11:11.650
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

11:14.958 --> 11:16.618
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

11:16.837 --> 11:20.242
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

11:20.664 --> 11:22.087
Have at it.

11:23.378 --> 11:27.447
All right. Turkey? That won't work.

11:27.658 --> 11:30.054
Cheese? That won't work.

11:30.406 --> 11:33.811
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.574
Are you making him a sandwich?

11:38.965 --> 11:41.290
No, it's more like a wrap.

11:43.835 --> 11:45.982
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.

11:46.201 --> 11:50.720
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

11:53.612 --> 11:56.244
We have to get her a present?

11:56.987 --> 12:00.107
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

12:00.327 --> 12:03.588
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

12:05.407 --> 12:08.705
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

12:08.921 --> 12:12.526
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

12:21.516 --> 12:22.831
Cassie?

12:23.533 --> 12:24.992
Hey, Ross!

12:26.386 --> 12:28.747
It's been so long!

12:29.726 --> 12:31.149
Last time I saw you...

12:31.361 --> 12:35.074
...you were setting up your tent
in line for Return of the Jedi.

12:35.293 --> 12:36.573
That's right.

12:36.824 --> 12:41.272
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

12:42.703 --> 12:46.179
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

12:46.426 --> 12:50.388
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

12:50.601 --> 12:54.005
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.

13:15.791 --> 13:19.468
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

13:23.653 --> 13:26.049
I have a knack for impressions.

13:26.297 --> 13:29.417
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
you could do me.

13:29.637 --> 13:30.953
Yeah. No!

13:40.214 --> 13:42.919
How you doing on that...

13:43.137 --> 13:44.595
...hot dog?

13:47.312 --> 13:49.779
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

13:52.635 --> 13:57.392
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

13:57.679 --> 14:02.507
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

14:04.220 --> 14:07.340
We're probably too old to do that now.

14:09.682 --> 14:14.403
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

14:17.823 --> 14:20.077
I'll always remember that summer...

14:20.294 --> 14:24.007
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

14:24.504 --> 14:27.908
You know, we're not just
two random people thrown together.

14:28.157 --> 14:31.632
We share genetic material.

14:32.053 --> 14:33.998
It took you that long
to figure it out?

14:34.559 --> 14:36.112
I'm a little slow.

14:38.247 --> 14:41.094
Just as our children would be.

14:47.779 --> 14:48.883
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:49.136 --> 14:52.232
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.836
Thank you. So nice to see you.

14:55.051 --> 14:57.898
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

14:58.113 --> 15:00.544
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

15:01.765 --> 15:04.303
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

15:04.549 --> 15:08.369
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

15:08.585 --> 15:11.775
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

15:13.316 --> 15:16.863
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

15:17.074 --> 15:20.715
- How do you know Monica?
- I was her accountant four years ago.

15:20.935 --> 15:25.941
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

15:26.989 --> 15:28.543
That's great.

15:29.946 --> 15:33.730
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.446
Excuse us.

15:38.506 --> 15:41.531
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

15:41.742 --> 15:45.526
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

15:46.091 --> 15:49.768
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

15:56.214 --> 16:00.971
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

16:02.512 --> 16:03.865
Those look great.

16:04.077 --> 16:08.075
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.

16:08.322 --> 16:11.027
- The toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

16:11.210 --> 16:12.419
Thank God.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.978
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

16:17.820 --> 16:21.011
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.733
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

16:23.943 --> 16:26.410
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

16:27.527 --> 16:32.355
I also did a little something in fur,
but that's really just for me.

16:35.390 --> 16:39.554
Why don't you try these on? We'll
get a better idea of what works.

16:39.774 --> 16:43.320
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

16:50.003 --> 16:52.635
Okay, the taffy's too sticky.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.833
I was afraid of that.

16:55.744 --> 16:57.582
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

16:59.326 --> 17:01.864
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

17:02.075 --> 17:04.020
- And?
- Delicious.

17:06.772 --> 17:10.034
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

17:10.251 --> 17:11.603
What? Which one?

17:12.895 --> 17:16.264
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

17:26.186 --> 17:30.812
She's your cousin.
She's your cousin.

17:31.544 --> 17:36.930
If she knew what was going on in
your head, she'd think you were sick.

17:43.025 --> 17:47.153
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.

17:47.374 --> 17:52.096
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.269
She was the one who
turned down the lights.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.193
She was the one that wanted to rent
Logan's Run...

17:59.412 --> 18:02.330
...the sexiest movie ever.

18:05.848 --> 18:07.793
I know that look.

18:08.041 --> 18:12.312
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.

18:12.599 --> 18:14.057
I'm going in.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.599
What the hell are you doing?

18:27.558 --> 18:29.467
Say something clever.

18:31.942 --> 18:33.816
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.

18:34.029 --> 18:37.849
Just has to be words. Say some words.

18:38.692 --> 18:41.812
Any words will do.

18:43.250 --> 18:46.204
Oh, my God, this is the longest...

18:46.416 --> 18:50.828
...that anyone has not talked ever!

18:52.608 --> 18:55.349
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...

18:55.601 --> 18:58.661
...so just say something!

19:00.715 --> 19:04.499
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

19:08.334 --> 19:11.075
Yeah, you really shouldn't
have said anything.

19:13.797 --> 19:16.050
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

19:16.267 --> 19:20.466
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

19:25.139 --> 19:28.923
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

19:29.175 --> 19:32.853
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.572
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.434
You already had it?

19:39.647 --> 19:43.193
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

19:43.405 --> 19:47.332
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

19:47.544 --> 19:51.708
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

19:51.963 --> 19:53.837
Now you don't have either.

19:54.051 --> 19:55.474
We ruined everything.

19:55.686 --> 20:00.372
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

20:00.592 --> 20:04.103
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?

20:04.314 --> 20:08.763
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

20:09.046 --> 20:13.874
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

20:19.762 --> 20:21.779
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

20:28.286 --> 20:31.964
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

20:32.217 --> 20:34.613
My whole family's from Naples.

20:34.826 --> 20:39.868
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear...

20:40.185 --> 20:42.510
We just need to, uh...

20:43.212 --> 20:44.148
Leslie?

20:44.777 --> 20:48.976
- Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Hey, right. Not a problem.

20:49.196 --> 20:51.484
I totally understand you need...

20:51.700 --> 20:55.769
...to make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

20:55.979 --> 20:57.189
Don't you worry.

20:57.894 --> 21:00.325
I have nothing to hide.

21:01.790 --> 21:04.566
So, there you go. That's me.

21:04.852 --> 21:07.105
One hundred percent natural.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.283
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

21:32.198 --> 21:34.594
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

21:34.808 --> 21:37.584
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me stay here.

21:37.799 --> 21:39.911
Oh, it's no problem.

21:58.153 --> 21:59.089
What?

21:59.718 --> 22:02.185
Say something. Say anything.

22:02.711 --> 22:05.308
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
