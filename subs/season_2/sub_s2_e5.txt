WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:08.470
Man, I sure miss Julie.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.473
Spanish midgets.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.841
Spanish midgets wrestling....

00:14.949 --> 00:17.611
Julie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.521
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.694
I'm trying this screening thing.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.627
If I always answer the phone,
people will think I have no life.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.059
My God!
Rodrigo never gets pinned!

00:35.336 --> 00:37.827
At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.903
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.368
This is Jade.

00:41.675 --> 00:45.577
I don 't know if you 're still
at this number, but I was thinking...

00:45.813 --> 00:49.146
...about how great it was.
I know it's been three years...

00:49.350 --> 00:51.716
...but I was hoping
we could hook up again.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.911
I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

00:55.189 --> 00:57.350
-...so you know what I did?
-What?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.559
I got a little drunk...

00:59.760 --> 01:00.727
...and naked.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.257
Bob here!

01:04.665 --> 01:06.428
The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant

01:52.878 --> 01:55.278
So what have you been up to?

01:55.514 --> 01:57.175
Oh, you know, the usual.

01:57.416 --> 01:58.747
Teaching aerobics...

01:59.618 --> 02:01.745
...partying way too much.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.847
And in case you wondered...

02:04.122 --> 02:08.024
... those are my legs on
the new James Bond poster.

02:11.096 --> 02:13.462
Can you hold on?
I have another call.

02:13.699 --> 02:15.360
-I love her!
-I know.

02:16.802 --> 02:19.703
-I'm back.
-So are we gonna get together?

02:19.938 --> 02:20.870
Absolutely.

02:21.606 --> 02:23.198
How about tomorrow afternoon?

02:23.408 --> 02:26.104
Do you know Central Perk?
Say, five-ish?

02:26.311 --> 02:28.438
Great. I'll see you then.

02:32.884 --> 02:35.079
Having a phone has finally paid off.

02:37.422 --> 02:39.686
You do a good Bob impression...

02:39.891 --> 02:41.586
... but when she
sees you tomorrow...

02:41.793 --> 02:44.159
...she's gonna realize
you're not Bob.

02:56.364 --> 02:59.060
I'm hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

02:59.300 --> 03:03.202
...she'll seek comfort in the arms of
the stranger at the next table.

03:03.405 --> 03:06.135
Oh, my God.
You are pure evil.

03:07.475 --> 03:09.033
Okay, pure evil...

03:09.911 --> 03:11.469
... horny and alone.

03:14.482 --> 03:15.949
I've done this.

03:23.024 --> 03:24.821
Yeah, everybody's here.

03:25.826 --> 03:28.590
Hey, everybody!
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

03:29.730 --> 03:31.254
Hi, Julie.

03:33.234 --> 03:35.065
While Ross is on the phone...

03:35.269 --> 03:38.170
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

03:38.506 --> 03:41.737
Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

03:43.678 --> 03:44.440
...you know...

03:44.679 --> 03:46.271
...from like 20?

03:47.348 --> 03:50.249
Hey, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

03:50.451 --> 03:52.112
Do we need a cake?

03:53.854 --> 03:55.287
I know it's a little steep.

03:58.559 --> 04:00.049
But it's Ross.

04:01.529 --> 04:02.689
It's Ross.

04:04.565 --> 04:06.123
See you later.
I gotta go...

04:06.434 --> 04:08.026
...do a thing!

04:09.437 --> 04:11.632
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later.

04:11.872 --> 04:14.363
You're not going
through with this, are you?

04:14.742 --> 04:17.040
You know, I think I might just.

04:19.413 --> 04:22.143
What are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

04:23.451 --> 04:26.443
Well, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

04:27.388 --> 04:30.323
I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

04:30.624 --> 04:32.888
Can you believe
how much this costs?

04:33.461 --> 04:36.396
Do you guys ever
get the feeling that...

04:36.630 --> 04:38.063
... Chandler and those guys...

04:38.599 --> 04:41.397
...don't get that
we don't make that much money?

04:42.970 --> 04:45.768
They always say
let's go here, let's go there.

04:45.973 --> 04:48.840
Like we can afford to go
here and there.

04:49.343 --> 04:53.439
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice.

04:53.748 --> 04:58.617
And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday thing...

04:58.819 --> 05:00.184
...and it's "for Ross."

05:00.421 --> 05:01.911
For Ross.

05:04.592 --> 05:05.752
Oh, my God!

05:07.294 --> 05:08.318
I'm at work...

05:09.296 --> 05:12.459
...just an ordinary day,
chop, chop, saute, saute.

05:13.367 --> 05:16.461
Suddenly, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

05:16.670 --> 05:19.662
They fired the lunch chef,
and guess who got the job?

05:19.874 --> 05:22.638
If it's not you,
this is a horrible story.

05:24.044 --> 05:26.137
Fortunately, it is me.

05:26.347 --> 05:28.815
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you!

05:29.049 --> 05:30.641
That's so cool!

05:31.185 --> 05:34.052
Anyway, I think we
should go out and celebrate.

05:34.288 --> 05:36.188
You know, someplace nice.

05:41.829 --> 05:43.319
Someplace nice.

05:43.731 --> 05:46.291
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

05:53.207 --> 05:54.731
You can't do this.

05:55.676 --> 05:58.975
I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

05:59.246 --> 06:00.213
It doesn't matter.

06:00.414 --> 06:05.351
She wanted to call Bob. Bob could be
who she was meant to be with.

06:05.553 --> 06:08.522
You may be destroying
their chance for happiness.

06:08.722 --> 06:10.189
We don't know Bob.

06:11.225 --> 06:14.592
We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

06:16.030 --> 06:18.931
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.158
All right.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.600
Go.

06:34.849 --> 06:36.441
Listen, I have to....

06:37.017 --> 06:38.678
I have to confess something.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.250
Yes?

06:42.756 --> 06:45.224
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

06:46.126 --> 06:48.219
-How did you
-I don't know.

06:50.431 --> 06:54.629
I just had this weird sense.
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

06:57.771 --> 06:58.795
Tissue?

07:00.040 --> 07:00.904
Thanks.

07:02.443 --> 07:04.206
No, you keep the pack.

07:04.979 --> 07:06.537
I'm all cried out today.

07:22.463 --> 07:25.864
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.000
Also in charge of purchasing.

07:28.235 --> 07:31.136
Head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing

07:31.405 --> 07:34.636
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

07:35.342 --> 07:39.278
Lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk
when Roland's not there...

07:39.480 --> 07:42.608
-... here's to my
-Wait! And I got a beeper!

07:46.120 --> 07:47.985
That's fine, I'll just wait.

07:48.289 --> 07:49.256
Sorry.

07:51.325 --> 07:52.189
Monica!

07:55.262 --> 07:56.627
Are we ready to order?

07:56.830 --> 07:58.457
We haven't even looked yet.

07:58.699 --> 08:00.326
When you do, let me know.

08:00.534 --> 08:03.264
I'll be over there
on the edge of my seat.

08:08.876 --> 08:10.366
Look at these prices!

08:10.644 --> 08:13.204
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

08:14.348 --> 08:17.215
I know! What are these,
famous chickens?

08:18.619 --> 08:21.179
Sorry I'm late.
Congratulations, Mon.

08:21.455 --> 08:25.357
I'm not sorry I'm late.
How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?

08:25.559 --> 08:29.120
Pretty incredible, according to
the message on my machine.

08:29.863 --> 08:34.061
Why is this woman leaving a message
for you on my machine?

08:34.301 --> 08:36.201
I told her that
my number was yours...

08:36.403 --> 08:38.394
... because I couldn't
tell her it was mine...

08:38.672 --> 08:41.573
... because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

08:42.876 --> 08:46.368
Tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

08:48.048 --> 08:49.174
Do I dare ask?

08:49.383 --> 08:52.819
I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then the grilled prawns.

08:53.020 --> 08:54.351
Great, same for me.

08:54.989 --> 08:56.354
And for the gentleman?

08:56.590 --> 08:58.217
I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

08:58.425 --> 09:01.553
But if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

09:01.762 --> 09:03.696
...is it cheaper?

09:03.931 --> 09:06.195
You'd think, wouldn't you?

09:08.769 --> 09:11.670
I will have the side salad.

09:12.406 --> 09:14.533
And what would that
be on the side of?

09:15.609 --> 09:16.439
I don't know.

09:16.710 --> 09:19.702
Just put it right here
next to my water.

09:22.416 --> 09:23.542
And for you?

09:24.585 --> 09:28.749
I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and...

09:31.925 --> 09:33.290
...take care.

09:36.230 --> 09:38.357
I will have the Cajun catfish.

09:38.565 --> 09:39.395
Anything else?

09:39.600 --> 09:43.127
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

09:44.438 --> 09:47.066
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

09:59.013 --> 10:01.641
Plus tip, divided by six....

10:02.817 --> 10:04.842
Everyone owes 28 bucks.

10:06.487 --> 10:07.920
Everyone?

10:08.689 --> 10:10.919
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

10:11.292 --> 10:12.122
Thank you.

10:12.326 --> 10:14.954
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

10:16.464 --> 10:18.125
So five of us is...

10:19.166 --> 10:20.895
...33. 50 a piece.

10:21.102 --> 10:23.536
No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

10:24.839 --> 10:26.636
Prom night flashback.

10:28.843 --> 10:31.641
Sorry, Monica.
I'm happy you got promoted...

10:31.846 --> 10:35.009
... but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

10:35.283 --> 10:36.307
No!

10:37.685 --> 10:40.176
Rachel just had that little salad...

10:40.388 --> 10:43.789
...and Joey with his teeny pizza!

10:44.292 --> 10:45.850
Okay, Pheebs.

10:46.460 --> 10:49.156
How about we'll each
pay for what we had?

10:49.363 --> 10:50.625
It's no big deal.

10:50.898 --> 10:51.796
Not for you.

10:56.337 --> 10:57.827
All right, what's going on?

10:58.839 --> 11:00.966
I don't wanna get
into this right now.

11:01.175 --> 11:03.234
It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.369
You can tell us.

11:06.581 --> 11:09.482
Yeah, hello? It's us.
We'll be fine.

11:17.192 --> 11:18.181
We three...

11:18.393 --> 11:20.156
...feel like that...

11:20.862 --> 11:24.320
...sometimes you guys don't get that....

11:31.706 --> 11:34.106
We don't have
as much money as you.

11:39.380 --> 11:40.347
I hear you.

11:41.082 --> 11:43.073
We can talk about that.

11:44.118 --> 11:45.380
Well, then...

11:47.121 --> 11:48.281
...Iet's.

11:52.060 --> 11:55.359
I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

11:55.563 --> 11:57.724
-Because you have it.
-Good point!

12:00.068 --> 12:03.799
So how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

12:04.038 --> 12:07.769
Because it's always something.
Like with Monica's new job...

12:07.976 --> 12:10.638
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

12:12.547 --> 12:17.109
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative....

12:17.318 --> 12:19.218
There's gonna be a hoopla?

12:21.756 --> 12:26.250
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing

12:27.061 --> 12:29.962
If it makes anybody feel better,
forget the thing...

12:30.164 --> 12:32.223
...and we'll just do the gift.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.992
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

12:36.070 --> 12:38.800
No, we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

12:39.073 --> 12:40.472
Hootie and the

12:40.742 --> 12:43.006
I can catch them on the radio.

12:44.012 --> 12:47.243
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

12:47.448 --> 12:49.814
No, look. It's my birthday...

12:50.018 --> 12:53.181
...and the important thing
is that we're all together.

12:53.421 --> 12:54.353
-All of us.
-Together.

12:54.622 --> 12:56.351
Not at the concert.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.327
Thank you.

13:07.802 --> 13:11.101
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

13:16.343 --> 13:18.208
Gee, Monica.
What's in the bag?

13:18.446 --> 13:20.971
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

13:21.182 --> 13:23.116
Oh, it's like a skit.

13:24.718 --> 13:27.516
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

13:27.721 --> 13:30.121
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

13:32.193 --> 13:36.061
We switched suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

13:36.297 --> 13:40.529
But wait, there's more.
Chandler, what is in that envelope?

13:42.470 --> 13:45.564
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

13:46.807 --> 13:49.674
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish!

13:52.813 --> 13:54.303
The Blowfish!

13:56.250 --> 13:58.878
It's on us. So don't worry.
This is...

13:59.086 --> 13:59.916
...our treat.

14:01.722 --> 14:02.689
Thank you.

14:05.759 --> 14:07.522
Could you be less enthused?

14:07.728 --> 14:10.162
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.160
But it just feels like....

14:12.733 --> 14:13.665
Like?

14:14.435 --> 14:15.265
Charity.

14:15.503 --> 14:16.595
Charity?

14:16.871 --> 14:19.203
We're just trying
to do a nice thing here.

14:19.406 --> 14:23.502
But you have to understand, your
"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.

14:23.744 --> 14:26.679
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.446
I don't understand.
We can't win with you guys.

14:32.753 --> 14:35.779
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

14:36.056 --> 14:37.921
Maybe that's just how you feel.

14:40.794 --> 14:43.456
Now you're telling us how we feel.

14:43.764 --> 14:45.732
We never should have talked about this.

14:45.966 --> 14:48.093
I'm gonna pass on the concert.

14:48.302 --> 14:51.203
I'm just not in a very
"Hootie" place right now.

14:54.275 --> 14:56.038
-Me neither.
-Me too.

14:56.443 --> 14:58.468
Guys, we bought the tickets.

14:58.779 --> 15:02.237
Then you'll have extra seats
for all your tiaras and stuff.

15:03.584 --> 15:06.815
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

15:10.224 --> 15:11.987
So I guess now we can't go.

15:12.226 --> 15:16.560
Do what you want. Do we always
have to do everything together?

15:17.598 --> 15:19.589
You know what? You're right.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.665
Fine.

15:24.772 --> 15:26.069
All right.

15:26.974 --> 15:28.737
We're gonna go.

15:33.814 --> 15:36.749
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

15:48.762 --> 15:49.956
Are you ready?

15:50.164 --> 15:53.531
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

15:55.703 --> 15:57.694
What? You had sex today?

15:58.372 --> 16:01.273
It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it!

16:02.776 --> 16:06.940
I was awesome. She was biting her lip
to stop from screaming.

16:08.482 --> 16:11.883
I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

16:17.191 --> 16:18.715
Still doing the screening?

16:19.193 --> 16:20.854
I had sex today.

16:21.795 --> 16:24.229
I never have to
answer that phone again.

16:24.999 --> 16:27.559
At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

16:27.835 --> 16:29.166
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

16:29.403 --> 16:33.237
I wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn't show up yesterday.

16:33.507 --> 16:37.341
And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

16:38.812 --> 16:40.245
Bob here.

16:41.915 --> 16:44.042
So you met someone, huh?

16:44.251 --> 16:45.718
Yes, I did.

16:45.986 --> 16:49.478
In fact, I had sex
with him two hours ago.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.855
So how was he?

17:05.272 --> 17:08.605
Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

17:11.845 --> 17:14.871
I bit my lip to keep from
screaming your name.

17:17.518 --> 17:20.078
Well, that makes me feel so good.

17:20.921 --> 17:23.583
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

17:25.459 --> 17:29.793
Maybe he had some kind of new style
that you're not familiar with.

17:30.597 --> 17:32.030
You have to get used to it.

17:32.266 --> 17:34.598
There wasn 't much time
to get used to it...

17:34.802 --> 17:36.770
...if you know what I mean.

17:46.814 --> 17:49.749
You know what? I'm not gonna
be able to enjoy this.

17:49.950 --> 17:53.249
I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

17:53.954 --> 17:55.444
So let's go.

18:01.995 --> 18:04.395
Well, maybe we should stay
for one song.

18:04.598 --> 18:07.465
It would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

18:07.668 --> 18:10.330
The guys are probably
having a great time.

18:13.974 --> 18:15.965
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

18:18.078 --> 18:18.942
One.

18:29.923 --> 18:31.185
-Amazing!
-Excellent!

18:31.425 --> 18:33.120
I can't believe the guys missed it!

18:33.327 --> 18:35.261
What guys?
Oh, yeah.

18:37.131 --> 18:39.622
Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica Geller?

18:40.033 --> 18:42.433
-Do I know you?
-You were my baby-sitter!

18:43.337 --> 18:45.601
Oh, my God!
Little Stevie Fisher?

18:45.806 --> 18:47.296
How have you been?

18:47.541 --> 18:49.202
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

18:49.810 --> 18:51.710
You can't be a lawyer.
You're 8.

18:52.646 --> 18:55.046
It was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

18:55.282 --> 18:56.442
Wait, backstage?

18:56.650 --> 18:58.208
My firm represents the band.

19:02.122 --> 19:04.056
You guys wanna meet the group?

19:04.858 --> 19:05.654
Come on.

19:05.893 --> 19:09.192
Are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my Dad?

19:14.735 --> 19:15.565
Hey, you guys!

19:15.803 --> 19:16.701
Happy birthday!

19:16.904 --> 19:18.565
Oh, thank you.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.801
How was your night last night?

19:24.044 --> 19:27.536
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

19:27.815 --> 19:29.407
Ours pretty much sucked too.

19:29.716 --> 19:32.082
But I ran into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

19:32.352 --> 19:34.411
Oh, yeah!
I used to baby-sit him.

19:34.688 --> 19:36.212
Hey, how's his dad?

19:38.425 --> 19:39.653
Good.

19:40.027 --> 19:43.258
Aside from that, the evening
was pretty much a bust.

19:43.497 --> 19:46.398
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.366
Yeah, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

19:50.571 --> 19:55.668
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like

19:56.109 --> 19:57.167
Is that a hickey?

19:59.413 --> 20:01.108
Oh, no, I just....

20:01.348 --> 20:03.077
I fell down.

20:05.285 --> 20:07.116
On someone's lips?

20:08.455 --> 20:10.082
Where'd you get the hickey?

20:10.357 --> 20:11.654
You know, a party or

20:11.859 --> 20:12.655
What party?

20:12.860 --> 20:15.420
It wasn't a party
so much as a...

20:15.696 --> 20:17.459
...a gathering of people.

20:18.966 --> 20:21.127
With food and music and...

20:21.401 --> 20:23.028
...and the band.

20:24.438 --> 20:26.565
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

20:26.807 --> 20:30.709
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

20:31.111 --> 20:33.238
Who gave you that hickey?

20:33.480 --> 20:35.710
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

20:38.986 --> 20:41.784
I can't believe it!
I can't believe this!

20:41.989 --> 20:46.483
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

20:49.129 --> 20:51.757
...and you're partying
and having fun and all:

20:51.965 --> 20:54.092
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

20:57.771 --> 21:00.331
Don't blame us.
You could've been there.

21:00.574 --> 21:04.442
What? As part of your
"poor friends outreach program"?

21:05.412 --> 21:06.674
Oh, great. It's work.

21:06.914 --> 21:10.577
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry we make more than you.

21:10.784 --> 21:13.912
But we're not gonna feel guilty.
We work really hard.

21:14.321 --> 21:15.788
And we don't work hard?

21:15.989 --> 21:17.616
It's Monica. I got a page.

21:17.824 --> 21:21.817
It's just that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

21:22.029 --> 21:24.122
And you feel like we hold you back.

21:30.103 --> 21:31.161
Leon, wait.

21:31.371 --> 21:32.201
Guys!

21:33.140 --> 21:34.266
I don't understand.

21:34.474 --> 21:36.635
The steaks were a gift
from the meat vendor.

21:36.877 --> 21:38.606
That was not a kickback.

21:39.112 --> 21:42.479
I'll just replace them,
and we can forget the whole thing.

21:45.452 --> 21:46.646
What corporate policy?

22:00.968 --> 22:02.128
I just got fired.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.635
Here's your check. That'll be $4. 1 2.

22:10.877 --> 22:12.071
Let me get that.

22:16.016 --> 22:17.074
You got 5 bucks?

22:27.194 --> 22:29.526
Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.

22:30.597 --> 22:32.656
Hi, it's me.

22:35.802 --> 22:38.896
Listen, Bob.
I'm probably way out of line here.

22:39.106 --> 22:42.940
It's been three years, and you 're
probably seeing someone else now...

22:43.143 --> 22:47.011
...but if we could have one night
together, for old time 's sake....

22:47.214 --> 22:49.876
One hot, steamy, wild night....
